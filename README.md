# Rotary Global History Fellowship — *First 100 Years* Preservation Archive

---

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository contains the comprehensive archival preservation of the *Rotary Global History Fellowship* "First 100 Years" project, originally hosted at [rghfhome.org](http://www.rghfhome.org) and later mirrored at [rghf.xyz](http://www.rghf.xyz).

The contents have been meticulously recovered, structured, and preserved to ensure permanent access to Rotary’s foundational historical records.

> **Archival Methodology:**  
> All materials were subjected to controlled extraction, cleanup, de-duplication, normalization, and versioned preservation to meet contemporary digital archival standards.

## 🛠️ Project Methodology

| Phase | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **1. Data Recovery** | Site crawled and mirrored using `wget` with asset validation. Full raw backup archived (`tar.gz`) and cloud-mirrored. |
| **2. Version Control** | Full Git versioning instituted prior to any transformations, ensuring immutable historical reference. |
| **3. Content Cleanup** | Custom Bash automation used to extract real historical content, strip obsolete markup (FrontPage, MS Word), and normalize file structures. |
| **4. Historical Navigation Extraction** | Legacy navigational structures preserved separately in Markdown for research and relational mapping. |
| **5. Preservation and Future-Proofing** | All critical data backed up in redundant cloud repositories and stored in normalized, migration-ready formats. |
