		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19"  width: 50%>District 5550 is an 
		all-Canadian district comprised of forty-seven Rotary Clubs with a total 
		membership of approximately 1,969. Twenty-three clubs are located in 
		Saskatchewan, twenty-one in Manitoba, and three in northwest Ontario. 
		The Clubs range in size from twelve to one hundred seven members. 
		Although District 5550 is one of the largest Districts in the Rotary 
		world, what makes it unique is not its size but its rich history.<br>
		<br>A number of District 5550 Rotarians filled significant Rotary 
		offices at the international level. Walter J. Clubb of the Winnipeg Club 
		served as second vice-president of the International Association of 
		Rotary Clubs in 1913-14. J. F. C. .Menlove, also a member of the 
		Winnipeg Club, served as first vice-president in 1913-14, but did not 
		make it through to president. That honour fell to Dr. Leslie Pidgeon, a 
		member of the Winnipeg Club, (1915-1925), who was elected president of 
		the international body in 1917-18. Joseph J. Caulder, successively a 
		member of the Winnipeg, Moose Jaw, and Regina Rotary Clubs, served on 
		eighteen international committees – some as chair - between 1922 and 
		1961.<br><br>The City of Winnipeg in 1910<br><br>In the late 1800s, 
		Winnipeg, Manitoba had gained worldwide recognition for its meteoric 
		growth; by 1900, it had become home to the largest cash wheat market in 
		North America. The city was Western Canadian headquarters for three 
		railways: the Canadian Pacific, the Grand Trunk National, and the 
		Canadian Northern. Settlers were pouring into the western plains through 
		Winnipeg, leading Chicago journalist William E. Curtis to predict in 
		1911 that Winnipeg “is destined to become one of the greatest 
		distributing commercial centers of the continent as well as a 
		manufacturing community of great importance.” Winnipeg acquired the 
		sobriquet, Chicago of the North. The city gradually won the attention of 
		international entertainers of the day such as Charlie Chaplin, the Marx 
		Brothers, Harry Houdini, and others who regularly performed there. It is 
		not surprising that Rotary should take root in Winnipeg.<br><br>The 
		Rotary Club of Winnipeg<br><br>In his 1935 book, This Rotarian Age, Paul 
		Harris described the formation of the Winnipeg Rotary Club as follows:<br>
		<br>Naturally, Canada presented the most logical field outside of the 
		United States for extension, and chance made Winnipeg the most available 
		city. The bombardment of Winnipeg’s ramparts began in 1909 and never 
		ceased until capitulation in November 1910. Thus the movement was 
		provided with an excuse for discarding the name, “National Association 
		of Rotary Clubs,” and appropriating the more pretentious “International 
		Association of Rotary Clubs.”<br><br>Harris’s account is only partially 
		correct. The incentive for creating a Rotary Club in Winnipeg came from 
		within, not from Chicago. The organizer of the Winnipeg Rotary Club and 
		arguably the father of Rotary International, was a little-known Canadian 
		named P. A. C. McIntyre.<br><br>McIntyre was employed by Berry Brothers, 
		varnish manufacturers in Winnipeg. In the summer of 1910, while 
		returning from a varnish manufacturers’ conference in Detroit, McIntyre 
		stopped in Chicago, to visit his cousin Will Lander, who was with the 
		U.S. Postal Service and a member of the Chicago Rotary Club. Lander 
		explained Rotary to McIntyre and arranged for him to have lunch with 
		Paul Harris and Chesley Perry, Secretary of the National Association of 
		Rotary Clubs, who inspired him with the Rotary story. After lunch, Paul 
		Harris took McIntyre back to his office and gave him some literature 
		about Rotary. It was said that McIntyre returned to Winnipeg “just 
		filled with Rotary.”<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style28" height="336" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/districts/images/5550.h7.gif" style="float: left" width="433">Because 
		McIntyre was not well acquainted in Winnipeg, he felt that a Rotary Club 
		would be an excellent means of enlarging his circle of business friends 
		there. He was impressed with the Objects of Rotary, particularly the 
		notion of bringing men from different businesses and professions 
		together for the purpose of doing business with each other (a principal 
		object in 1910). McIntyre discussed the possibility of forming a Rotary 
		Club in Winnipeg with his friend and lawyer A. W. Morley. Morley was 
		enthusiastic about the idea, so they began corresponding with Chesley 
		Perry. The historical records of the formation of the Club including the 
		first meeting were later donated to the Province of Manitoba Archives 
		for safe keeping. They form the basis of the following account.<br><br>
		In the fall of 1910, McIntyre spoke to a number of friends regarding the 
		formation of a Rotary Club. A great deal of discussion took place prior 
		to calling the first meeting, during which time someone contacted the 
		Rotary Club of Boston and obtained a copy of its bylaws. Also, numerous 
		communications – nicknamed Harris’s bombardments – took place with the 
		Chicago Rotary Club.<br><br>On 3 November 1910, the first meeting of the 
		Winnipeg Rotary Club took place in the YMCA building. The following 
		attended: P. A. C. McIntyre, William N. Brown, W. T. Pearce, R. Kershaw, 
		A. W. Morley. At the meeting, it was agreed that a Rotary Club should be 
		formed. The minutes of the meeting read as follows: “It was moved by A. 
		W. Morley, seconded by W. N. Brown that the club be organized and be 
		called the Winnipeg Rotary Club. Carried.” Thus the Rotary Club of 
		Winnipeg became the seventeenth Rotary Club in the world and the first 
		Rotary Club outside of the United States. The newly formed Club did not, 
		at that time, seek formal recognition or a charter from the recently 
		organized National Association of Rotary Clubs.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style28" height="259" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/districts/images/5550.h8.gif" style="float: left" width="448">The 
		November meeting was adjourned for four days to permit the initial five 
		attendees to seek out other members. The membership drive was 
		successful, as ten men attended the next Rotary meeting on 7 November at 
		A. W. Morley’s office in the McArthur Building in Winnipeg. McIntyre 
		told the group about his meeting with Harris and Perry. He reiterated 
		the objects of the Rotary Clubs, drawing special attention to “the 
		binding together of men in different trades and professions for the 
		purpose of doing business with each other.” A second motion creating a 
		Winnipeg Rotary Club was passed, and a slate of officers elected. The 
		first president was George A. Kobold.<br><br>A third meeting of the new 
		Club took place on 15 November 1910 at which Morley showed the Club the 
		set of Rotary bylaws that had been obtained from the Rotary Club of 
		Boston. Using a pen, Morley changed the Boston by-laws into by-laws for 
		the Winnipeg Rotary Club and the Club adopted them. At a meeting on 7 
		December 1910, a letter from Ches Perry was read which stated: “It is 
		evident that this will now have to be the International Association.”<br>
		<br>At a meeting on 11 October 1911, the Club collected one dollar per 
		person as the fee for the National Association of Rotary Clubs. The Club 
		secretary sent the money to the National Association with a request for 
		a formal charter. On 13 April 1912, Paul Harris signed the charter of 
		the Rotary Club of Winnipeg. At that time the Winnipeg Club was 
		recognized as Club Number thirty-five. Five members applied for letters 
		patent under the authority of the Joint Stock Companies Act of Manitoba 
		and the Winnipeg Rotary Club Ltd. came into existence on 14 September 
		1912.<br><br>On 2 February 1914, the lieutenant-governor of Manitoba 
		signed into law “An Act to incorporate The Rotary Club of Winnipeg,” 
		which was passed by the Manitoba legislature. The incorporators were: 
		James Francis Campbell Menlove, manager; James Woodburn Hillhouse, 
		secretary; James Hamilton Gordon Russell, architect; Luther Judge 
		Rumford, manager; John Alexander Campbell, grocer; Herbert Thomas Reade, 
		chartered accountant; Walter James Clubb, tobacconist; Charles Edward 
		Fletcher, manager; and Arthur Willans Morley, barrister-at-law. The 
		corporation - called the “club” – was managed by a board of directors 
		composed of six members. The board had the usual powers granted to 
		corporations, but the Club had incorporated principally to prevent 
		anyone else from using the Rotary name in Manitoba. As far as is known, 
		the Winnipeg Club was the first of many clubs around the world to 
		incorporate, legally, necessitating Rotary International to form a 
		policy regarding the relationship between incorporated clubs and Rotary 
		International. The 1921 Rotary Constitution and By-laws Committee 
		drafted the following policy:<br><br>“[The] governing body of Rotary 
		International may permit any member club or any club that may be 
		organized hereafter to become a body corporate under the laws of the 
		country or political division where such club is located and may permit 
		such club to alter or construct its constitution … provided such club 
		shall, so far as is possible, retain or embody in its constitution the 
		fundamental principles of Rotary as defined by Rotary International.”<br>
		<br>Similar policies exist today. For insurance purposes, most Clubs 
		either incorporate or incorporate an unusual activity rather than the 
		club itself.<br><br>The Internationalization of Rotary<br><br>As 
		discussed above, the National Association of Rotary Clubs was formed in 
		Chicago in 1910. The Winnipeg Club was admitted to membership in October 
		1911. Rotary clubs had been established also in Dublin, London, and 
		Belfast. A delegation led by Winnipeg Club president W. J. Clubb 
		attended the third annual convention of the National Association held in 
		Duluth, Minnesota, on 6 to 9 August 1912. Taking a cue from Chesley 
		Perry’s observation in 1911 that the National Association would have to 
		become an “international association,” Clubb moved the motion: “that the 
		name of the organization be changed from National Association of Rotary 
		Clubs to International Association of Rotary Clubs.” <br><br>The motion 
		carried, and the third convention of the National Association became the 
		first convention of the International Association of Rotary Clubs. In 
		1921, under the presidency of Crawford McCullough, the name was changed 
		again to Rotary International.<br><br>The Winnipeg International 
		Goodwill Meeting<br><br>Paul Harris always had a friendly attitude 
		toward Canada and Canadian Rotarians.<br><br>He once observed: “One 
		hundred unbroken years of American-Canadian friendship which has existed 
		along three thousand miles of unfortified borderland discredits the case 
		of those who proclaim the inevitability of war.” On another occasion, he 
		wrote graciously about the Winnipeg Goodwill Meeting: “One of the most 
		interesting developments is the organization of meetings between 
		Rotarians of various countries. Among the oldest is the inter-country 
		meeting held yearly between Rotarians of Canada and the United States by 
		the Rotary Club of Winnipeg.” In 1935, Paul Harris sent a message of 
		congratulations to the Rotary Club of Winnipeg on the occasion of the 
		Club’s twenty-fifth the anniversary. The letter was read at the 
		International Goodwill Meeting. Inter-country Goodwill Meetings were a 
		product of the Fourth Object of Rotary , the so-called international 
		objective of “advancement of international understanding, goodwill, and 
		peace” introduced by Halifax Rotarian Donald MacRae in 1921. The 
		Winnipeg Club’s goodwill weekend hosting Rotarians from North Dakota, 
		Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the western provinces was launched in 1924 and 
		after eighty years is still functioning. Paul Harris had a personal 
		knowledge of it having attended the 1929 meeting and delivering a speech 
		titled “Early Days of Rotary and its First Meetings in Chicago.” In a 
		letter dated 22 February 1941 for the seventeenth meeting he reminisced 
		about his visit to the 1929 Goodwill Meeting:<br><br>To Rotarians in 
		attendance at this seventeenth annual goodwill meeting of the Rotary 
		Club of Winnipeg, the city which by its joining the Rotary fellowship 
		long years ago converted a dream of internationality into an actual 
		fact. Greetings!<br><br>I still treasure happy memories of the goodwill 
		meeting I attended in 1929.<br><br>Perhaps Rotary’s most fascinating 
		objective is the promotion of international understanding and goodwill. 
		For centuries the ideal of a world at peace has been a will of the wisp 
		ever beckoning us on, but always eluding our grasp.<br><br>Burns’s plan 
		for the brotherhood of man rang out through the darkness of his period 
		in Clarion Tones. He predicted the ultimate achievement of the high 
		purpose even as we are predicting it now. The concept is so natural and 
		human that it will not go down.<br><br>The United States and Canada are 
		fortunate indeed that we speak the same language and inherited many 
		common traditions. These facts impose great responsibilities on citizens 
		of both countries. We have been singly blessed and it is for us to be 
		the great exemplars of the practicability of the doctrine which we 
		espouse.<br><br>Let us continue in our efforts to promote understanding 
		and goodwill with courage unabated and with necessary enthusiasm as the 
		years roll on.<br><br>Friends in attendance at the seventeenth annual 
		meeting sponsored by the Winnipeg Rotary Club, more power to you and may 
		each and every one of you become true and vigorous proponents of the 
		highest ideal of the human mind. Be you now and always Ambassadors of 
		goodwill.<br><br>Sincerely yours,<br><br>Paul Harris<br><br>Gordon 
		Hunter, a past president of the Winnipeg Club, thought that a proper 
		recognition should be accorded all out-of-town Rotarians attending 
		Goodwill Meetings. He created the Order of Rotary International 
		Fellowship which was unveiled at a Goodwill Meeting on 17 February 1934. 
		All out of town Rotarians who attend a minimum of five Goodwill Meetings 
		become members of the Order which entitles them to wear a distinctive 
		medal designed by Hunter.<br><br>Model United Nations Assembly (MUNA)<br>
		<br>Another significant international program sponsored by the Rotary 
		Club of Winnipeg is the Model United Nations Assembly (MUNA), an annual 
		event for high school students from Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Northern 
		Ontario, and the Northern U.S.A.&nbsp;</td>
