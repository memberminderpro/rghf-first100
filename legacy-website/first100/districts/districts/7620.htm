												<a href="http://www.rotary7620.org/HTML7.phtml">District 
												7620</a> </b>covers the area 
												beginning with the Susquehanna 
												River on the northeast; the 
												Mason-Dixon Line on the north, 
												the western boundary of 
												Frederick County, Maryland on 
												the west; the Potomac River and 
												its estuary on the southwest; 
												and the Chesapeake Bay on the 
												east. RI may change these 
												boundaries at any time.</p>
												<p align="justify">Rotary began 
												in what is now District 7620 
												with the chartering of the 
												<b>
												<a href="../../clubs/cities/clubs/48baltimore.htm">Baltimore club</a></b>, the 48th Rotary 
												club to be formed, on January 3, 
												1912. After a visit to 
												<b>
												<a href="../../clubs/cities/clubs/46washingtondc.htm">Washington</a></b> by Paul Harris, the 
												founder of Rotary, his club, 
												Chicago, sponsored Washington's 
												charter on July 11, 1912. Total 
												Rotary membership at the time 
												was under 5,000, but Rotary 
												already was international, with 
												clubs in Winnipeg, Canada, 
												Belfast, Northern Ireland, 
												London, and Havana, which became 
												the first non-English speaking 
												club.<br>
												<br>
												Rotary districts were 
												established in 1915, with the 
												Baltimore and Washington clubs 
												placed in District 3, which 
												covered all of Pennsylvania, 
												Delaware, Maryland and the 
												District of Columbia. George 
												Harris, charter president of the 
												Rotary Club of Washington, 
												became our first district 
												governor and later (1944-45) was 
												our district's first RI 
												director. He had the unique 
												distinction of attending every 
												international convention during 
												the first 50 years of his club's 
												existence, and he maintained 
												perfect attendance.<br>
												<br>
												In 1918 our area of District 3 
												became District 5, encompassing 
												eastern Pennsylvania, New 
												Jersey, Maryland and the 
												District of Columbia. The 
												Baltimore club, under the 
												leadership of George Bahlke, 
												sponsored nine new clubs, 
												beginning in 1920 with 
												Frederick. Annapolis and Havre 
												de Grace soon followed, as well 
												as many clubs now outside our 
												district, including Easton and 
												Cumberland.<br>
												<br>
												As part of District 34, 
												established July 1, 1922, we 
												added part of West Virginia; New 
												Jersey and some of Pennsylvania 
												were excluded. Westminster 
												became our sixth club. Beginning 
												in 1927, Brunswick, Towson, 
												Ellicott City, Bel Air, 
												Catonsville, Rockville and Glen 
												Burnie were formed before the 
												Great Depression set in. Yet, 
												between 1933 and 1938, 
												Bethesda-Chevy Chase, College 
												Park, Pikesville, Hampstead and 
												Dundalk--all sponsored by 
												different clubs--joined our 
												growing Rotary family.<br>
												<br>
												Paul Harris spent part of the 
												summers of 1934-1935 on Sam 
												Kaplan's farm in Ellicott City, 
												and returned to address the 
												Baltimore club on December 31, 
												1934, at the Rennert Hotel. His 
												subject was &quot;Money and Material 
												Things are not Necessary for 
												Happiness.&quot;<br>
												<br>
												District 180 was created on July 
												1, 1939. We retained the same 
												areas of West Virginia, Maryland 
												and the District of Columbia, 
												plus a different mix of 
												Pennsylvania counties. Silver 
												Spring and Sykesville-South 
												Carroll were chartered before 
												World War II. The next club to 
												be chartered was Kingsville 
												1n1946. Later, Lake Shore, 
												Elkridge, Parkton and Severna 
												Park were added. District 180 
												was re-configured on July 1, 
												1944 by exclusion of the 
												northern and western counties of 
												Maryland.<br>
												<br>
												In 1950, District 180 became 
												District 267. Edwin Unger of the 
												eastern shore's Federalsburg 
												Club was its first governor. 
												Aberdeen was the first new club 
												to join the District in 1950. 
												Bill Hardy, of the Frederick 
												club, became the youngest 
												governor in the world in 1951, 
												at age 28. He now resides in 
												Ellicott City. Olney received 
												its charter in 1951, then no 
												more new clubs joined until 
												Damascus and Southern Prince 
												George's (now Upper Marlboro) in 
												1956-57, under the leadership of 
												PDG Ernie Wooden of Baltimore.<br>
												<br>
												On July 1, 1957, District 762 
												was created from District 267; 
												boundaries were set at the 
												Chesapeake Bay and Susquehanna 
												River on the east, the 
												Pennsylvania state line on the 
												north and the Potomac River and 
												Frederick County on the west.
												<br>
												<br>
												District 762 had some 
												outstanding leadership: PDG Ted 
												Wilson of Baltimore became our 
												second RI Director in 1960-62, 
												serving as third vice president 
												of RI. PDG Donald Chamberlin of 
												Bethesda-Chevy Chase, formed 
												three new clubs in 1960 
												(Potomac, St. Mary's 
												County-Lexington Park and 
												Wheaton-Kensington), only to be 
												outdone by PDG Raj Saini in 
												1985-86 with five new clubs 
												(Columbia-Patuxent, Leonardtown, 
												Mt. Airy, Parole, and Waldorf.)
												<br>
												<br>
												College Park established the 
												district's first Interact club. 
												In 1974, Henry Tate (Potomac) 
												initiated a unique program to 
												establish a Rotary Scholarship 
												Fund for Gallaudet University, 
												which has now grown to an 
												endowment in excess of $200,000. 
												This program has now been taken 
												over by the clubs that are its 
												most consistent contributors.<br>
												<br>
												PDG Roland Cumberland of 
												Southern Prince George's (now 
												Upper Marlboro) formed the first 
												breakfast club, North Bethesda, 
												in 1974. He also established the 
												first district dues--$5.00 per 
												member per year. He appointed 
												PDG Dr. John Sever (Potomac) as 
												our first GSE chairman, with the 
												first GSE team exchange to/from 
												Australia that same year. As 
												Governor, Roland also started 
												quarterly presidents' meetings, 
												well in advance of the first 
												district Presidents-Elect 
												Training Seminar (PETS) in 1987 
												by PDG Morris Pallozzi (Ellicott 
												City). In 1978, under the 
												leadership of PDG John Sever, we 
												began participation in the Youth 
												Exchange program.<br>
												<br>
												Our first African-American club 
												president was Tom Briscoe 
												(Columbia) in 1976-77. In 1987, 
												during the term of PDG Bill 
												Luckan, women were first 
												admitted into clubs in the 
												district, a result of a US 
												Supreme Court decision. JoAnne 
												Dorman (Owings 
												Mills-Reisterstown) became the 
												first woman club president in 
												the District in July, 1990. With 
												Albert Kim's serving as 
												president of Woodlawn-Westview 
												in 1999-2000, that club has the 
												distinction of having had 
												presidents of European, African 
												and Asian heritage since its 
												chartering in 1987.<br>
												<br>
												General support of the Rotary 
												Foundation began in 1963 when 
												PDG Wilbur Baughman (Olney) 
												became the district's first Paul 
												Harris Fellow. He served as the 
												District's first Foundation 
												chairman. PDG Raj Saini 
												(Columbia) became our region's 
												National Coordinator for Polio 
												Plus, credited with raising 
												$4,750,000, with almost 
												$2,000,000 of that from our own 
												district. As PolioPlus began 
												immunizing the world's children, 
												PDG John Sever (the originator 
												of the PolioPlus program) took 
												on a key Foundation role as 
												international vaccination 
												coordinator. In 1990, PDG Jim 
												Buchanan (1974 -1975) became the 
												largest contributor in the world 
												to The Rotary Foundation with a 
												gift of over $3.2 million<br>
												<br>
												All Rotary districts added a 
												zero to their designation in 
												1991, and Judge Larry Margolis 
												became the first governor of 
												District 7620.<br>
												<br>
												In 1992, Morris Gevinson built 
												his friendly and effective team 
												of club presidents a year in 
												advance with pre PETS. A 4-Way 
												Test Speech Contest was 
												established, as well as the 
												district 4-Way Test award in 
												honor of Jim Houck (Timonium, 
												Hunt Valley), who had been 
												administering the program in 
												local schools, as a club 
												project, for over 30 years. A 
												District directory format was 
												established, a ten-year club 
												extension plan was created, and 
												a focus was established on 
												Rotaract, with both Washington 
												and Baltimore sponsoring 
												Rotaract clubs that year.<br>
												<br>
												In 1995, PDG Bob Nelson capped 
												off his year by having RI 
												President Bill Huntley of 
												England make an appearance at 
												our District Conference. PDG 
												Bob's leadership abilities have 
												resulted in his having been 
												selected to serve as RI 
												President's Representative to 
												several other District 
												Conferences, along with PDG John 
												Sever and PDG Larry Margolis.
												<br>
												<br>
												The 1993 visit of RI President 
												Cliff Dochterman to President 
												Bill Clinton initiated 
												establishment of an 
												NGO-government partnership to 
												fund the remainder of PolioPlus' 
												cost. In 1996, due to 
												considerable effort by PDG 
												Sever, the US Congress and the 
												White House recognized the 
												unique NGO-government 
												relationship that exists with 
												Rotary in its drive to eradicate 
												polio. This resulted in the US 
												government contributing $90 
												million to the PolioPlus 
												program. These funds, along with 
												those from Rotarians and from 
												other countries around the 
												world, have generated in excess 
												of $600 million. The anticipated 
												certification of a polio-free 
												world is expected in 2008.<br>
												<br>
												During 1998-99, under the 
												leadership of PDG John Murkey 
												(Parole), the district's 
												leadership program took a major 
												step forward, with the 
												nomination of governors for 
												three years hence. Governor Rob 
												Brown, 1999-2000, (Towsontowne) 
												continued this &quot;forward 
												leadership&quot;. Following their 
												years of service as governors, 
												PDG Murkey and PDG Brown, 
												respectively were appointed as 
												RI representatives to the World 
												Bank and the Organization of 
												American States.<br>
												<br>
												Catonsville-Sunrise, was 
												chartered in May 2001, bringing 
												the total number of clubs, for a 
												short period of time to 65. As 
												2000-2001 came to a close, the 
												Dundalk and Hampstead clubs (63 
												and 65 years old, respectively) 
												gave up their charters, bringing 
												us back to 63 clubs.<br>
												<br>
												In 2001-2002, under the 
												leadership of Andy Baum (Carroll 
												Creek), and consistent with a 
												major effort by RI (Global Quest 
												for Membership), our primary 
												goal was membership growth. 
												Although the Germantown club 
												resigned its charter, two new 
												clubs were chartered in December 
												- Central Prince George's 
												(District Heights) and West Anne 
												Arundel County. The Lanham club 
												reorganized itself as Northern 
												Prince George's and the Langley 
												club expanded as Takoma-Langley 
												Park. During Governor Andy's 
												year, the district hosted an 
												international conference in 
												Washington, DC &quot;Rotary Expansion 
												in Russia: Cold War Healing&quot; 
												under the leadership of Raymond 
												Raedy, our current Governor, 
												guests from numerous Russian 
												Rotary clubs, Canada, Europe and 
												throughout the United States 
												were present, and included RI 
												President Rick King, as well. 
												Also, under Governor Andy, five 
												clubs earned Community 
												Assistance Program grants, of 
												$2000.00 each from The Rotary 
												Foundation, for furtherance of 
												their specific and unique 
												projects in their respective 
												communities.<br>
												<br>
												Each of our governors and club 
												leaders brings time, talent and 
												energy to help the program of 
												Rotary continue to grow. 
												Changing times are upon us, but 
												Rotary provides a special 
												opportunity to provide &quot;Service 
												Above Self&quot; to those in need 
												throughout the world. We must, 
												and will, respond to the needs 
												of the hungry, the homeless and 
												those without health care to 
												provide hope to improve the 
												human condition and leave this 
												world a little better for our 
												having served Rotary and the 
												people of the world.</font></td>
