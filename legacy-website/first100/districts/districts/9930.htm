		As Rotary in New Zealand continued to prosper in the post World War 
		II years it again became necessary to reform the two North Island 
		Districts. District 292 had grown to 69 clubs in the northern half of 
		the North Island and in Pacific Island nations and District 294 covering 
		the lower half of the North Island had 59 clubs. In his book “Rotary in 
		the Seventies” the late PDG Bert Dreaver describes how “Governors and 
		other District officers normally travel by roads which climb over some 
		lofty mountain ranges as well as a massive plateau and they found that 
		the tortuous routes between Waipawa/Waipukurau in the south and Huntly 
		and Thames in the north represented not only a gap of miles, but a 
		canyon separating community interests.” In 1967/68, District Governors 
		Jack Porter of Bistrict 292 and Win Bassett of District 294 proposed the 
		establishment of a new District. Because of the topography of the 
		country and the overseas travel required, it was increasingly difficult 
		for District Governors to fulfill their duties to RI and the clubs.<br>
		<br>With effect from 1 July 1970, a new District designated 293 was 
		created. The new District, occupied the area of the central North Island 
		from Huntly and Thames in the north to Te Kuiti and Waipukurau in the 
		south, thus absorbing portions of Districts 292 and 294. The new 
		District 293 under Governor Ian Drabble (Te Puke club) had 43 clubs and 
		2,416 Rotarians., while District 292 under Governor Peter Rigg of Orewa 
		comprised 43 clubs and 2,490 Rotarians. Peter Rigg then aged 39 is the 
		youngest District Governor to hold the office in New Zealand. District 
		294 under A. Irvine of Wellington South comprised 44 clubs with 2,439 
		Rotarians.<br><br>The clubs in the new District comprised those in the 
		four provincial cities of Hamilton, Tauranga, Rotorua and Napier, with 
		the remainder being sited in smaller rural communities separated by some 
		distance and in topographically varied countryside ranging from plains 
		to mountainous. In the early days of the District, roads were not easy 
		to navigate and at least five District Governors wrecked their motor 
		vehicles while carrying out their official duties.<br><br>In July, a 
		national conference of 125 Interactors was held at Hamilton and a 
		further week-end gathering took place in October at Napier. In August, 
		1970, Rotaractors<br>from District 293 attended a national conference at 
		the University of Auckland. Both Interact and Rotaract in New Zealand 
		have suffered severe declines over recent decades and few clubs now 
		exist although efforts are being made to re-establish Rotaract. <br><br>
		In August-September, 1970, members of the Whakatane West club organised 
		a party of 30 to travel to Taveuni and Vanua Levi Islands in the Fiji 
		Group to carry out educational aid projects.<br><br>The first District 
		293 District Conference was held early in 1971 at Tauranga attended by 
		379 Rotarians and the first conference awards were made, and Nick Carter 
		of the Mt Maunganui club made a donation of $1,000 to the Rotary 
		Foundation, being the first New Zealand Rotarian to do so. <br><br>1971: 
		The District Governor elect was Eric E. Wiig (Napier West) who died 
		before assuming office and on 3 July, 1971, Ian Drabble received the 
		following cablegram from the new RI President Ernst G Breitholtz:-<br>
		<br>DEEPLY REGRET LOSS OF ERIC WIIG STOP WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU WOULD 
		AGREE TO SERVE AS ACTING GOVERNOR PENDING BOARD SELECTION OF DISTRICT 
		GOVERNOR STOP IT WOULD MEAN MUCH TO ROTARY INTERNATIONAL AND YOUR 
		DISTRICT IF YOU WOULD SERVE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR IF ELECTED BY BOARD STOP 
		AWAIT YOUR FAVOURABLE CABLE REPLY<br>ERNST BREITHOLTZ<br><br>Thus, 
		Drabble served for two consecutive years as District Governor.<br><br>
		This Rotary year all four Districts held a combined conference at the 
		thermal resort of Rotorua in District 293. To commemorate the Jubilee of 
		the establishment of Rotary in New Zealand the District established the 
		South Pacific Trust with a target of $50,000, an amount of $2,000 was 
		contributed towards a Hall of Residence at Waikato University and $5,000 
		was contributed towards building a coolroom-freezer on the Pacific 
		Island of Tonga. A new club was chartered at Fairfield, a suburb of the 
		provincial city of Hamilton.<br><br>Under the leadership of DG Brian 
		Bradshaw (Putaruru) in 1972-73, $5.000 from the Jubilee Trust was 
		provided to clubs to carry out a variety of projects, and in excess of 
		$92,000 in money, materials and labour distributed in aid to Pacific 
		island nations. <br><br>In 1973, the District under DG Bill De Costa 
		(Gisborne) saw the establishment of three new Rotaract clubs in Hamilton 
		North, Cambridge and Central Hawkes Bay.<br><br>DG Graeme Lee (Paeroa) 
		in 1974 was the second governor to be drawn from the Paeroa club, the 
		first being John Craig in 1959-60.. Enthusiastic and an excellent 
		communicator, he established a newspaper “RENEWS and during the year, 
		six copies were distributed to all clubs for every member. Graeme also 
		set up a District Public Relations Committee and a District Publicity 
		Committee. During his year two additional clubs were in the process of 
		formation at Taupo Moana and Kihikihi, although the latter was not 
		chartered until the following year, and he actively promoted the revival 
		of the ROVE (Rotary Overseas Vocational Exchange) programme which had 
		been initiated by Hilmar Moen of the Whakatane club in 1953 under the 
		name of Rotary Youth Exchange. This programme provided work experience 
		for one year in an overseas country. The District conference discussed 
		and approved a number of remits, including one that endorsed the per 
		capitation levy of $1.00 per member for District Conference 
		administration. <br><br>In 1975, DG Bert Holmes published for the first 
		time, the name of the District Rotaract chairman in his District 
		Directory. All clubs in the Tauranga area, from Katikati in the north to 
		Te Puke in the south were involved in organising his District Conference 
		at Tauranga.<br><br>In 1977-78 a further combined conference was held in 
		Rotorua with District 292. The Tauranga club initiated a “Pride in 
		Workmanship” project and plaques were for the project were presented to 
		the then prime minister, Sir Robert Muldoon and the Minister of Labour. 
		A 19 year old German Youth Exchange student hosted by the Rotorua West 
		club defied the rules concerning serious “dating” and maintaining a 
		friendship with a German youth who had followed her to New Zealand. 
		District Governor Neville Dyer, the host club and the girl’s parents all 
		determined that she should return to her homeland but she refused. The 
		girl’s permit to reside in New Zealand was withdrawn and she was 
		returned to Germany. The matter received much publicity in the media and 
		was taken up by the government’s Race Relations Conciliator, mostly 
		arguing that Rotary’s attitude was outdated and too restrictive of 
		modern youth. District Governor Neville declined to become involved in 
		the media frenzy that ensued over the matter and this decision proved to 
		be a wise one. The District received many more applications from young 
		people wishing to participate in the Exchange, as parents approved of 
		Rotary’s discipline.<br><br>Because of their rural nature, the Clubs 
		tend to have small memberships and devote most of their Service 
		activities to providing amenities within their own communities, with 
		some outstanding achievements. They have sponsored Probus clubs where 
		retired and semi-retired professional and business people can meet once 
		monthly for Fellowship. These meetings broadly follow the lines of 
		Rotary clubs but have no Sergeant-at-Arms and do not engage in 
		fund-raising. The clubs in the District have always been ready to 
		provide aid to disaster areas, whether they be in New Zealand or 
		overseas. When the disastrous Cyclone Bola devastated the District’s 
		Gisborne, Napier East Cape areas in 1988, $50,000 was raised for relief 
		purposes. The District has provided funds for flood relief in the 
		country’s Northland area, its own Thames region and farming communities 
		in the South Island, suffering the effects of snowstorms.. Overseas aid 
		has been provided to Pacific Island nations with the provision of water 
		tanks to Tonga, medicines to Fiji, the refurbishment of a retirement 
		home in Western Samoa, and various forms of aid in Africa, India and 
		Papua-New Guinea. Assistance was provided by the Waihi club in hosting 
		an Ethiopian agricultural scientist for six weeks’ study, and aid has 
		been given to refugees from war-torn Croatia and Bosnia-Hertzogovina.
		<br><br>In 1986, the Rotary Club of Paeroa erected a building in the 
		main street of the town’s commercial area. This was leased out and the 
		proceeds put towards funding club projects. <br><br>The District is 
		firmly committed to Youth and has actively supported International Youth 
		Exchange. New Zealand is a multicultural nation in which the two 
		predominant races, Maori, the indigenous people, and Europeans generally 
		live in harmony, despite some lingering disputes resulting from land 
		confiscations during the Land Wars of 1863-65. Both races fought 
		alongside each other in two World Wars and recognise the courage of each 
		in those conflicts. As a nation, New Zealand is passionate about its 
		national winter sport of Rugby football, with intense rivalry towards 
		the equal passion displayed by South Africans. In 1973, the nation was 
		divided when the government of the day prohibited a proposed tour by the 
		national team to South Africa in opposition to the Vorster government’s 
		policy of apartheid. In 1981, a different government declined to 
		prohibit a tour to New Zealand by the South Africans, saying that 
		politics should not be related to sport and this decision completely 
		divided the country. The match in Hamilton was called off by the police 
		as protesters invaded the playing field and during the final game of the 
		tour, in Auckland, the players were attacked with flour bombs from a 
		low-flying light aircraft. It was in this environment that a young South 
		African student, Nicole Oscher was hosted by the Rotary Club of Rotorua 
		West. Although she was readily accepted without any opposition by the 
		students, both Maori and European, at the school she attended, she 
		became the national target of the print and electronic news media, 
		members of parliament, the government-appointed Race Relations 
		Conciliator, trades unions and the protest movement generally. Members 
		of the Rotorua West club were picketed, abused and threatened as they 
		attended their weekly club meetings. Miss Oscher, the club and the 
		District Governor, Ian Johnson, all stood firm against this, insisting 
		that world peace and understanding among the peoples of the world were 
		more important than politics. It is to the lasting credit of Miss Oscher 
		that she comported herself with such dignity and courage throughout a 
		very difficult time. <br><br>The District participates in a wide range 
		of programmes including Group Study Exchange, Ambassadorial Scholars, 
		RYLA, Rotaract and Peer Support for school students. .It has 
		consistently nominated students to attend the annual Rotary 
		International Science &amp; Technology Forum in Auckland, and concerned that 
		the limited number of places available at the Forum prevented 
		participation by many eligible students, PDGs Tom Ryan and Peter Parr, 
		in association with the University of Waikato, established the Waikato 
		Science Summer School in 1993.. . <br><br>Public Health has always been 
		a concern of the District. It has supported Polio Plus from its 
		inception and the Child Health research Foundation, established in 
		1971-72 by District 9920. $75,000 has been raised for Child Cancer and 
		support for Cure Kids, for research into childhood diseases.. In 1999, 
		the 15 members of the Turangi club, with support of $7,600 from RI and 
		the Rushville, Indiana club (D-6560) initiated the hearing and vision 
		testing of all high school students and twenty young people were 
		provided with corrective glasses. .In 1997 DG Ron Horsley launched the 
		Spinal Cord Cure Appeal for $100,000 in support of the Spinal Cord 
		Society of New Zealand. The money raised enabled Dr Deborah Stuart to 
		travel and work with Dr Jean Peducci and her research team at the 
		University of Alabama investigating stem cell research and the cure of 
		paralysis caused by spinal cord damage. Dr Stuart returned to New 
		Zealand and now heads a research unit at the University of Otago Medical 
		School. The District is actively engaged in a number of programmes 
		including drug awareness programmes directed at young people, <br><br>
		In1999, the Putaruru club of 17 members inducted Yvonne Sycamore as the 
		District’s first woman club president. Some 19 years earlier, she had 
		been the first recipient of the Putaruru High School Young Achievers 
		Award, initiated by the club, which also established the Putaruru Rotary 
		Education Trust In 2003 Trish O’Reilly of the Huntly club became the 
		District’s first woman District Governor.<br><br>The District is an 
		active supporter and participant in Rotary Friendship Exchanges, Trees 
		for Survival, and the clubs assist many local cultural, environmental 
		and health initiatives.<br><br>District Governors<br><br>District
