			<br>
			District 1160 of Rotary International comprises the whole of the 
			island of Ireland. It has 2,700 members in seventy-four clubs, 
			<a href="../../clubs/cities/clubs/65dublin.htm">the 
			first of which was founded in Dublin in 1911</a> as the first Rotary 
			Club outside North America, followed a few months later by the 
			foundation of the <a href="../../clubs/cities/clubs/67belfast.htm">Rotary Club of Belfast</a><br>
			<br>
			The idea of Rotary was brought to Ireland by 
			<a href="../../leaders/morrow.html">Williarn Stuart Morrow</a>, 
			who returned from the United States to his native land in 1911 - 
			just six years after the first Rotary meeting in Chicago in 1905. In 
			conjunction with his brother-in-law, William A. McConnell, Morrow 
			formed the Dublin Club (22nd February, 1911), after which he moved 
			north where he brought into being the Club of Belfast (24th July, 
			1911) <br>
			<br>
			In 1912, a few months after the formation of the Belfast Club, Hugh 
			Boyd, the Honorary-Secretary of that Club, visited the Rotary 
			Headquarters in Chicago for the purpose of obtaining greater 
			knowledge of the Movement. Whilst there, he discussed the 
			possibility of Clubs in Great Britain and Ireland becoming 
			affiliated to the 'National' Association, and on his return, the six 
			original Clubs in these islands did affiliate as the result of the 
			information which he was able to impart. At its 1912 Convention, The 
			National Association of Rotary Clubs was renamed The International 
			Association of Rotary Clubs (I.A.R.C.).<br>
			<br>
			On his appointment in 1913, as a Director of I.A.R.C., William 
			Findlater (Dublin), representing Great Britain and Ireland, became 
			the first Rotarian in these islands to hold International Office. 
			The first Convention of the International Association in 1913 was 
			attended by five delegates from Great Britain and Ireland, one of 
			whom was John Sheridan (Dublin). Shortly after the formation of the 
			Belfast Club, the London Club came into being (on 3rd August, 1911), 
			followed by Manchester (1912), Glasgow (1912), Edinburgh (1912), 
			Liverpool (1913) and- Birmingham (1914).<br>
			<br>
			In May 1914, at a meeting held in London and attended by 
			representatives of the eight original clubs, the British Association 
			of Rotary Clubs (B.A.R.C.) was formally constituted. Each club was 
			entitled to appoint two of its members as Directors on the Board. 
			Those representing the Irish Clubs were Richard White and William A 
			McConnell (Dublin) and William C. Gabbey and Hugh Boyd (Belfast). At 
			the Convention of the international association held in June 1914, 
			the B.R.A.C. was officially recognised, and further, William 
			Findlater (Dublin) and- W. H. Alexander (Belfast) were respectively 
			elected Vice-President and Director of the International 
			Association. In 1912 Charles E. White (Belfast) was one of three 
			representatives from the B.A.R.C on a joint Committee that met in 
			Chicago for the purpose of drawing up a constitution for the 
			international association. At the international convention in 1922, 
			the International Association of Rotary Clubs changed its title to 
			Rotary International (the suggestion of this new title coming from 
			Charles E. White). At the same time, the British Association 
			voluntarily affiliated itself to the international movement and 
			changed its name from The British Association of Rotary Clubs to 
			Rotary International, Association Great Britain and Ireland; this 
			was subsequently changed again to Rotary International in Britain 
			and Ireland (R.I.B.I.). It was a condition of the affiliation by the 
			British Association to the International Association that the 
			liberties and practices already in force in the Clubs in these 
			islands would be preserved, and they were in fact safeguarded by the 
			International Convention of 1927 and 1933.<br>
			<br>
			The first gathering of a representative character in the Irish 
			District took place at 'Ye Old Castle Restaurant', Belfast, in 1924. 
			The official delegates attending were William McConnell (Dublin), 
			Robert G. Todd (Belfast), Walter Malcolm (Belfast), Charles E. White 
			(Belfast) and James N. McLaughlin (Londonderry). At this meeting the 
			first District Committee was formed. The Officers elected were 
			Chairman, James N. McLaughlin (Londonderry); Honorary Secretary 
			Walter Malcolm (Belfast); Honorary Treasurer, Herbert Bailey 
			(Dublin). <br>
			<br>
			'Cogs', the district magazine, first appeared as a Dublin City 
			publication on 17th November 1913. With the approval of the District 
			Council on 30th November 1928 Cogs became the official journal of 
			all the Clubs in the District. 'Cogs', together with our district 
			directory, or 'Roster' are the pride of the district. The detail 
			contained in our district directory remains unique in the Rotary 
			world. The district's presence on the Internet and increasing use of 
			modern communications is a natural extension of these publications.<br>
			<br>
			Many Rotarians in District 1160 have held high office in Rotary 
			International and R.I.B.I. (and their respective predecessors). The 
			most prominent of these are:<br>
			<br>
			Charles E. White, who was elected a Director of Rotary International 
			in 1927; <br>
			William A. McConnell (Dublin), President of B A R C in 1921/22; <br>
			Charles E. White (Belfast), President R.I.B.I. in 1925/26; <br>
			John Little (Belfast), President R.I.B.I, 1965/66; <br>
			Hugh Boyd (Belfast), Honorary Auditor of the B.A.R.C. for many 
			years. <br>
			From 1967 the work of District 116 took on an additional outward 
			look, and Group Study Exchange, Special Grants and Technical Awards 
			were added to the 'fifth avenue' of service - Foundation Service. 
			Pioneer work was accomplished in world community service and other 
			facets of the international aspect. Leadership Forums and Rallies 
			became established features in the annual programme.<br>
			<br>
			Extension went on progressively. In the seventies, 11 new clubs were 
			chartered and in the eighties 21. So far the nineties has seen 
			another four clubs, bringing the total in the District to 72. Of 
			these, thirty-five clubs meet on Monday and there is only one 
			breakfast club in the district. During the same period there was 
			considerable extension of Probus Clubs, which now number 110 clubs, 
			and strenuous efforts were made to organise Rotaract and Interact 
			Clubs.<br>
			<br>
			The worldwide Rotary campaign, launched in 1986/87 to provide 
			vaccine for the prevention of Polio, measles, tetanus, pertussis, 
			diphtheria and tuberculosis (PolioPlus) caught the imagination of 
			Irish Rotarians. Clubs set targets to ensure that the district 
			maintained its just reputation as generous. With the total pledge of 
			Rotary International at $120 million, the District’s share at £100 
			per member was £243,300 - a target that was eventually exceeded. 
			District P.D.G.s have served with distinction on R.I.B.I. committees 
			for Extension, Vocational Service, Community Service, the 
			Consultative Committee, the Conference Committee and on the 
			committees for Rotaract, and World Community Service.<br>
			<br>
			From the 1st July 1991 the district became known as District 1160, 
			all Rotary districts adding '0' to their district number. So since 
			1911, Rotary in Ireland has progressed from District 16 to 116 to 
			1160.<br>
