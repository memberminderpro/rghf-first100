		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">Rotary came to Sweden in 
		early 1926 by the advent of the Stockholm Rotary Club whose charter 
		letter was signed on February 20 1926. Rotary had taken root in 42 
		countries. Sweden became the 43rd Rotary country and the Stockholm 
		Rotary Club the 2,256th club in the world. The number of Rotarians in 
		the world was then about 125,000. Today (ie per 2004-06-30) is the 
		number of Rotary clubs in the world 31,603 and the number of Rotarians 
		1,211,723. <br><br>The initiative for the formation of the Stockholm 
		Rotary Club, was not taken by another Rotary Club, but by American Fred 
		Warren Teele from the Rotary newly opened office in Zurich. The club 
		started already in autumn 1925. Its first meeting, the then Provisional 
		club on October 28 1925. What few know is that Paul Harris unofficially 
		visited Stockholm in the autumn of 1925 and met among others Director 
		John Sande, head of National Cash Register in Sweden and his 
		brother-in-law, member of the Oslo club, Jens Aspaas, NCR-chief in 
		Norway (I have received know of John Sands grandson Bjorn Sande who was 
		president of my own club 1997-98). <br><br>Its constituent meeting had 
		Stockholm Rotary Club January 8, 1926 with 27 charter members. A board 
		of 8 persons appointed by the building Josef Norén as charter president, 
		Axel F. Enström as first Vice President and Professor Gosta Bagge as the 
		second Vice President. It may be useful to mention that at the 
		constituent meeting decided that the club would meet with lunch every 
		Wednesday at 13 in Restaurant Rosenbad. Furthermore, it was decided that 
		the entry fee would be 50 kronor and the annual fee SEK 25. As a 
		curiosity, I might mention that when lunch cost 3:50. Charter-party took 
		place on January 9, 1927. Among the guests were Fred Warren Teele, RI 
		Director TC Thomsen and the presidents of Rotary Clubs in Oslo and 
		Copenhagen. <br><br>Saturday, February 19, 1927 was crucial for the 
		establishment of Rotary in the Kingdom's second city. <br><br>&quot;At the 
		request of three members of the Stockholm Rotary Club held a luncheon at 
		the then Palace Hotel. The men traveling from the capital, said that it 
		would certainly be of benefit and joy of a Rotary club - in that case, 
		the second in the country - also formed in Gothenburg. &quot; <br><br>This 
		appears in the club's archives of documents held by the State Archives 
		in Gothenburg. <br><br>Gothenburg Rotary Club received its charter 
		letter Sept. 27, 1927. Already on October 5 the same year was the club 
		celebrate its charter celebration with V. Aurell as its charter 
		president. Attended by among others the then RI President Arthur H. Sapp 
		and the Secretary-General Chesley R. Perry, but also representatives of 
		Rotary clubs in Stockholm, Oslo, Copenhagen, Aarhus and Aalborg. Of the 
		club archive documents deserve following quoting: <br><br>&quot;At the 
		election was used at the beginning of white and black balls but it was 
		not so good. Always came up a black ball, so it was disturbed impossible 
		to bring in new members. It had to be (sometime in the early 30's) to 
		move to another less emphatic veto procedure. &quot; <br><br>The only 
		official visit of Paul Harris made in Sweden is a visit to Gothenburg 
		Rotary Club August 29, 1932, when the club celebrated its 5-year 
		anniversary at the Garden Association, which then met in summer. After 
		the meal Paul Harris planted an American oak as a 'friendship tree'. The 
		event was filmed and is conserved in a video. The oak is left with a 
		plaque, which got its present form in connection with the club <br>
		60-year anniversary in 1987. Gothenburg Rotary Club over the years have 
		given rise to at least 17 new Rotary Clubs. The first five were 
		Birkenhead (1930), Hastings (1932), Halmstad (1935), Tauranga (1935) and 
		Pondicherry (1938). <br><br>In early 1927 visited Kurt Belfrage on 
		behalf of the Stockholm Rotary Club together with the president in 
		Copenhagen Rotary Club, Consul Erik Andersen, Malmoe and Helsingborg in 
		order to bring about new Rotary clubs. Gisborne Rotary Club received its 
		charter letter April 2, 1928 as the country's third Rotary Club. Of the 
		club's records show that the club was invited by, among other things, 
		Rotary International's &quot;Special Commissioner&quot; TC Thomsen of Denmark and 
		the international secretary of the Zurich office of Russell V. Williams 
		to establish a Rotary club in Malmo. The archive documents förtäljer to 
		Kurt Belfrage and Hugo Cedergren, who both represented the Stockholm 
		Rotary Club, visited Malmo December 9, 1927, where they met with Kramer 
		at several incoming charter members. <br><br>After an evening meeting 
		took place on October 18, 1928 at the Savoy Hotel in Malmo, was the 
		inaugural meeting in Malmo Rotary Club held Nov. 15 in the same hotel, 
		while 22 members were included in the club who was elected as a member 
		No 3.012 of Rotary International on December 12, 1928 with the Consul 
		Gunnar Faxe as Charter President. <br><br>On this occasion, the 
		Stockholm Club President, Will Council Axel F. Enström, a guestbook for 
		the new club. Of colleagues in Copenhagen was a unique club 
		president-gavel made of oak wood from the year 1784 built örlogsfartyget 
		&quot;Man&quot;, which was sunk on September 2, 1807 by the English fleet. <br>
		<br>Gefle root club back on the initiative of the Stockholm Rotary Club 
		(with Josef Norén and Hugo Cedergren in the lead) and Gothenburg Rotary 
		Club (represented by Arvid Wallin. The decision to form the club was at 
		the Hotel Baltic January 29, 1929 whereby NEGOTIANT Gustav Delin was 
		appointed as the club's first president. <br><br>Unfortunately, admits 
		the time that I go into more detail on the subsequent emergence of new 
		Rotary clubs in Sweden. This is, however, &quot;10-first 'list out (along 
		with charter date): <br><br>Stockholm February 20, 1926 <br>Gothenburg 
		September 27, 1927 <br>Helsingborg April 2, 1928 <br>Malmo December 12, 
		1928 <br>Gefle March 6, 1929 <br>Bendigo April 23, 1930 <br>Ballarat 
		November 5, 1930 <br>Hobart August 26, 1931 <br>Sundsvall February 15, 
		1932 <br>Jönköping January 12, 1933 <br><br>Rotary in Sweden had in the 
		late 1920s 5 Rotary Clubs. During the 30's was 36 clubs, over 40's 54, 
		during the 50's 110, during the 60's 85, during the 70's 104, in the 80s 
		95, in the 90's 61 and so far in 2000 Century 16 new clubs. It appears 
		that the growth of new clubs reached a peak until 1960 and then 
		gradually contracts, especially in recent years, which is largely 
		explained by the fact that Sweden after Iceland is the Rotary densest 
		country in the world. During these 80 years soon have 4 Rotary Clubs 
		ended: Pajala (1998-05-12), Valdemarsvik (1990-06-15) Stockholm-Farsta 
		(2001-06-30) and Avesta-Folk (2003-04-02). <br><br>The Swedish Rotary 
		Clubs were - excluding the Russian and Latvian clubs which currently 
		belong to the Swedish Rotary District - by June 30 in 2004 to 556. 
		Growth is illustrated by the following table. <br><br>Number of Rotary 
		Clubs in Sweden (December 31, respectively. Annum): <br><br>1929 5 <br>

		<br>1999 540 <br>2004 556 (June 30) <br><br>As of July 1, 1933 
		constituted the whole of Sweden a Rotary District 78. To the District 
		Governor was appointed Kurt Belfrage. Because of the growing number of 
		clubs took place on July 1, 1948 a division into two districts with No 
		78A and 78B, the number was reduced to 84 and 85 the following year.<br>
		<br>1952 was the number Rotary District in Sweden three (No. 83, 84 and 
		85). Two years later by District 95 and five years later, a fifth 
		district, with No. 94. On 1 July 1957 to set up a sixth district, while 
		the numbers were about to be 132, 133, 134, 136, 137, and 139 with the 
		number sequence from north to south. On 1 July 1961 was awarded District 
		134 of the two (134 and 135). Since it took to the July 1, 1972 before 
		the Eighth District back (138). On 1 July 1977 renumbered districts from 
		232 to 239. On 1 July 1988 added two additional districts. Since then, 
		the number of Rotary District in Sweden ten. Current district in 240 and 
		241 were added to each of 43 Rotary Clubs. District 2330 for a club: 
		Älvkarleby-Skutskär previously included in District 235 (our district). 
		Districts in 2320 and 2340 were not affected by the new district 
		division. 5 of the districts had to drop a total of 86 clubs. The 
		4-digit numbering of the districts we have today was introduced on July 
		1 1991. <br><br>What has evolved in the Rotary District 2350? Twenty 
		years ago, the number of Rotarians in the district of 2.785. Ten years 
		ago it was 3.372. And today (ie per 1 July 2004) is the number 3.797 
		excluding our Rotarians in Russia. <br><br>In Russia, west of the Urals, 
		where Moscow RC was chartered June 5, 1990 as the first Rotary club was 
		established in the 90's 19 clubs, of which our district currently 
		administers 12 and our neighboring districts in 2370 administers 7. In 
		2000's, yet another 4 Russian clubs to come within our administrative 
		area and in what districts in 2370 accounting for a further 11 Rotary 
		Clubs. In addition, there are three provisional Rotary clubs, including 
		one in our district (Yaroslavl) and two in the neighboring district 
		(Saratov Volga and the Voronezh Central). The 16 Rotary Clubs are part 
		of our district have been together 348 members, while the 17 clubs in 
		District 2370 has 408 members, a club (Saratov RC chartered in 1995) 
		ceased on 2004-04-01. <br><br>In Latvia, which belongs to District 2410, 
		is currently 17 Rotary Clubs together with 435 members, including two 
		clubs back in the 30s has been re chartered in: Riga (April 1933) and 
		Liepaja (August 1939). 12 new clubs formed in the 90s and 3 new date in 
		the 2000s. <br><br>In Poland, which belonged to the district in 2390 
		until June 30 1997, when the country became a separate district (No. 
		2230), are two clubs with roots in the 1930's: Lodz (December 1933) and 
		Krakow (February 1934) and one from the 80's: Warsaw (June 1989). During 
		the period of Poland belonged to the district in 2390, that in the years 
		1990-1997, formed a further 36 Rotary Clubs with a total of 1.228 
		Rotarians, a club (Slupsk RC) has been dissolved. Today, in Poland 65 
		Rotary Clubs with approximately 1.800 members. <br><br>How does the
