				<b>HOUSTON DISTRICT 5890 HISTORY<br><br></b></div>
			At a time when Rotary International can claim 1.2 million members 
			and nearly 31,000 clubs, it is difficult to think of a time when 
			there were less than 5,000 members and 50 clubs comprising the 
			entire world of Rotary.<br><br>Yet, such was the case when the
			<a href="../../clubs/cities/clubs/53houston.htm"><strong>Rotary Club 
			of Houston</strong></a> was founded, on November 1, 1912, and 
			received charter No. 53, of the National Association of Rotary 
			Clubs. Today, the Rotary Club Houston is one of the oldest clubs in 
			Rotary.&nbsp; Any consideration of the history of the present District 
			5890 of Rotary International, or of any aspect of Rotary in all of 
			South Texas, for that matter, must begin with full appreciation of 
			the enduring leadership of the Rotary Club of Houston. <br><br>
			According to the 2008-09 Roster of District 5890, ten of the sixty 
			clubs of the district list the Rotary Club of Houston as their 
			sponsor, and we may take any one of those ten and develop an 
			interesting kind of genealogy. Pasadena, the second largest club in 
			the district, has sponsored six clubs. Harrisburg has sponsored 
			four; several clubs have sponsored two or three. It may well be that 
			every club in the district is a lineal descendent of the Rotary Club 
			of Houston.<br><br>Despite the fact that it has been the principal 
			factor in the growth of Rotary in this area, the Rotary Club of 
			Houston has not assumed a role of dominance. As might be expected, 
			in the first thirty-five years of its existence - from 1916, when 
			Rotary first grouped clubs into district - until the immediate 
			post-war years, the Houston club furnished most of the District 
			Governors. However, since the creation of the present District 589, 
			in 1956, the Houston club has furnished only seven men for that 
			office. Nevertheless, the Rotary Club of Houston, by reason of its 
			age, its size and its prestige, continues to be the bench mark for 
			all Rotary activity in this part of Texas.<br><br>What we know today 
			as District 5890 has been variously numbered and variously 
			constituted. In 1950, for example, it included forty-three clubs in 
			the area from Orange to Weimar and from Galveston to Nacogdoches, 
			and was then District 190.&nbsp; Prior to that it had been numbered 12, 
			18 and 47. In 1955, the number of clubs in the Houston area having 
			increased, the district lines were re-drawn and the district was 
			given the present designation of District 589. The first Governor of 
			the newly constituted district was W. H. &quot;Bill&quot; Avery, a member of 
			the Houston Club.<br><br>Incidentally, the only man ever to be 
			District Governor without first having been presidents of his club 
			was Walter Jenkins, long-time International song-leader, and later 
			to become president of the Houston Club.<br><br>Of the sixty club 
			presently comprising District 5890, as shown in the 2007-08 
			Information Directory, forty-two have been organized since the end 
			of World War II.&nbsp; <br><br>As might be expected, the range of club 
			size is very great. The Houston club has 294 members; Palacios has 
			twenty-seven. The latter club would seem to prove that growth alone 
			is not an adequate index to the viability of a club. Palacios was 
			chartered in 1934. Thirty-five years ago the membership was about 
			thirty-five, but neither gain nor loss seems to alter the 
			determination of the club to make Rotary known in that town.<br><br>
			Pasadena has proved that a community does not need to be a 
			metropolis to sustain two Rotary Clubs of good size. The growth of 
			the city of Pasadena proved to be such that in early 1967, the 
			Rotary Club of Pasadena sponsored the Rotary Club of South Pasadena. 
			In 2007, Pasadena had 161 members; South Pasadena has 43. <br><br>
			Such is the nature of Rotary today that every club is expected to 
			engage in a project in one or more of the Lanes of Service. Since 
			these projects almost certainly require funds, every club must seek 
			for the means of raising those funds.<br><br>The Houston club's 
			&quot;Lombardi Award&quot; dinner is not only their primary fund-raiser, but 
			it is a major event in the sports life of the city. Football 
			notables from all over the country attend, and the event generates a 
			great amount of media coverage.<br><br>For the most part, 
			fund-raisers in District 5890 clubs take several forms: Food sales 
			(pancakes, shrimp boil, fish fry, barbecue, chili, spaghetti) with 
			or without an auction; Las Vegas or casino night, also with or 
			without auction; raffle, usually involving an expensive car or 
			truck, although one club has its prize a Caribbean cruise. There are 
			golf tournaments and fun runs. Alvin takes part in their community 
			&quot;Frontier Day&quot;, and Palacios conducts the &quot;Miss Palacios&quot; contest. 
			At another level the University Area club conducts an annual book 
			fair for the benefit of M. D. Anderson Hospital volunteer services. 
			From all this it can be seen that a major part of the energy of 
			every club is directed toward raising funds to support its good 
			works.<br><br>The Rotarians of District 5890 involve themselves in 
			International Service in many ways, not all of them within Rotary's 
			organized framework. For example, the Angleton club has, since 1962, 
			worked with the American Field Service student exchange program, and 
			as a result has hosted eighteen students from countries outside the 
			United States. <br><br>In 1973, William &quot;Bill&quot; Carter, of England, 
			then president of Rotary International, visited for three days in 
			Bay City and participated in that club's observance of its fiftieth 
			anniversary. Beginning in 1970 and continuing to the present time, 
			Houston Heights has exchanged visits with the Tacubaya Club of 
			Mexico City.<br><br>Rotary Foundation announced the new Group Study 
			Exchange program in 1965. Six years later a Houston Heights Rotarian 
			led a six-man team to District 275, in Australia.&nbsp; A team from 
			District 120, England, visited this district in 1974, and in April 
			of 1975 a Harrisburg Rotarian led a team for a visit to District 
			120. Another team visited District 950, Australia, in 1980, and the 
			next year a similar team from that district visited our District 
			589.<br><br>From time to time Rotary Foundation Fellows come to 
			study for a year in one or another of the numerous institutions of 
			higher learning in Houston and vicinity.&nbsp; The District has a 
			committee of Rotarian Counselors whose responsibility it is to 
			provide hospitality for visiting Foundation scholars. When these 
			scholars are in the District, in order to comply with a portion of 
			their responsibility, they make appearances before the various 
			clubs. It would seem, however, that not all clubs become aware of 
			their presence and so are deprived of their visits.<br><br>There are 
			presently sixty clubs in District 5890, with a total membership of 
			3,100. The relative rank of District 5890 in giving among all the 
			districts of the Rotary world is probably irrelevant here. It is to 
			be expected that some districts will place very great emphasis on 
			such giving, while other districts place very little.<br><br>Suffice 
			it to say that the clubs of District 5890 regard the Rotary 
			Foundation as but one element in Rotary's multi-faceted program, and 
			generally maintain a balanced stance in their giving for the world 
			community and for the community at home.<br><br>The District 5890 
			administrative structure is a complex one. In the 2008-09 year there 
			are sixteen Assistant Governor, each AG serving as liaison to from 
			three to five clubs. While the District Governor is required to 
			personally visit each of the sixty clubs in the course of his year, 
			it is obviously impossible for the DG to maintain a continuing 
			intimate relationship with each one. The Asst. Governors perform 
			that function. <br><br>The entire district committee structure 
			involves something over one hundred individuals. This is a way by 
			which a great number of Rotarians may be drawn into activities which 
			enable them to see something of the scope of Rotary beyond their 
			respective clubs, and whatever can be accomplished probably enriches 
			both Rotary and the Rotarians involved.<br><br>When one reads the 
			historical summaries of the Rotary Clubs in District 5890, it 
			becomes immediately apparent that each club is uniquely different; 
			that, even when bound together by the principles and ideals of 
			Rotary, each club has its own ideas of how to go about realizing 
			those principles and ideals.<br><br>The reader will also sense that, 
			for the individual Rotary Clubs, the District is not the essence of 
			Rotary. It is but a superstructure standing between the club and 
			Rotary International. Club morale, club understanding of the Object 
			of Rotary, club effectiveness in earning a place for itself in the 
			community are all attainments for which the individual club takes 
			full responsibility and credit. In a very real sense, the Rotary 
			District is not an array of clubs all marching in step, but is, 
			instead, a collection of highly individualistic entities whose 
			greatest desire may be to practice Rotary as they see it.<br><br>
			This is to say that this district, and every Rotary district, should 
			see itself, not as administrator or judge of conformity, but as a 
			helper, a supplier of ideas and, when necessary, a coordinator of 
			activity.&nbsp; The sixty clubs of Rotary District 5890 are bound 
			together by their common loyalty and understanding of the Object of 
			Rotary and by their common belief in the validity of Rotary's motto, 
			''Service Above Self&quot;.<br><br>Posted 28 May 2009 by RGHF webmaster
