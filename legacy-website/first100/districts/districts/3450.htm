			</b><font size="2">Rotary did not become truly international until it extended to 
			Asia in 1919 when clubs were organized in the Philippines, China and 
			India, thus attesting to the universality of Rotary by proving that 
			its principles possessed the vitality and appeal, to transcend not 
			only national boundaries and language limitations but also the 
			barrier of race, religion and creed.<br>
			<br>
			Rotary was an alien import when the first club in China was 
			established in 1919 in 
			<a href="../../global/asia/clubs/02shanghai.htm"><strong>Shanghai,</strong></a> and there was considerable doubt as 
			to whether it would acclimatise itself to the Chinese soil. Other 
			clubs were started in Tientsin in 1923 and in Beijing in 1924, but 
			until 1931 these three remained the only Rotary clubs in all China.<br>
			<br>
			Then Rotary began to develop and the number of clubs was increased 
			to seven by 1932 - the four additional clubs were established in 
			Hong Kong and in the three Manchurian cities of Dairen, Harbin and 
			Mukden. The life of the three clubs in Manchuria was, however, very 
			brief as they were forced to cease functioning following the 
			Japanese occupation in the same year.<br>
			<br>
			Through the efforts of the late Dr. C.T. Wang, (close relative of 
			P.P. Wing Chow of Victoria Rotary Club) eleven new clubs were 
			organized in different parts of China between 1932 and 1935. The 15 
			clubs which were then in existence in China together with the Rotary 
			Club of Hong Kong, and three other Rotary clubs in the Philippines, 
			were in 1935 Constituted into Rotary District 81, with the late Dr. 
			C.T. Wang elected as its first district governor.<br>
			<br>
			When the Japanese invaded Shanghai in 1937, there were 23 clubs in 
			China, one in Hong Kong and three in the Philippines, having a total 
			of 1,211 Rotarians. They were then divided by Rotary International 
			into three Rotary Districts as follows:<br>
			<br>
			District 96 which replaced 81 in October 1937 covered roughly South 
			China, Hong Kong and the Philippines with 11 clubs and 529 members; 
			District 97 for Central China with 11 clubs and 475 members and 
			District 98 for North China with five clubs and 207 members.<br>
			<br>
			In 1938, the Philippine Islands were detached from District 96 of 
			South China, but Macau was included in this district although there 
			was no Rotary club in the Portuguese enclave at that time.<br>
			<br>
			In the following four years prior to the outbreak of the Pacific War 
			in December 1941, many of the Rotary clubs in the Chinese cities 
			under the Japanese occupation were still permitted to operate 
			according to the official directories of R.I.. Those four years 
			recorded the existence of 25 clubs in 1938 and 26 clubs each in 
			1939, 1940 and 1941. The 26 clubs included those in <br>
			Chungking, Chengtu, Changsha and Sian, which were still free from 
			the Japanese occupation.<br>
			<br>
			The Japanese changed their policy following the outbreak of the 
			Pacific War by closing down all the Rotary clubs in Japan and in all 
			other territories occupied by them. Chungking, the capital of 
			wartime China, was bombed in four successive years, yet the 
			Chungking Rotary club had never stopped functioning. Rotary 
			International records showed that the Chungking club continued to 
			hold weekly meetings as usual; but not always in the same place. 
			When warning of an approaching air raid was received, a new meeting 
			place was selected and word was passed along to its members.<br>
			<br>
			Changsha, another city in free China, was three times the chief 
			target of the Japanese attack. The club there had to move out from 
			the city on each Japanese onslaught, but still carried on its 
			meetings.<br>
			<br>
			After the outbreak of the 2nd World War, Shanghai Rotarians stopped 
			functioning as a club because the Japanese would not allow it to 
			meet regularly, but the members continued for some time to get 
			together informally every week, often times in their homes.<br>
			<br>
			Rotary in China had shown great vitality as well as courage. 
			Notwithstanding frequent air raids and other dangers, Rotarians had 
			succeeded in establishing four new Rotary clubs during the war years 
			when Western China held its own. These four clubs were organized in 
			Lanchow, Wuchow, Kweilin and Kweiyang. There was a total of nine 
			clubs with 295 members in China by August 1945 when Japan 
			surrendered to the Allied Forces.<br>
			<br>
			Because of air raids and loss of territory Rotary in China had 
			suffered a great setback, but the outlook immediately after the end 
			of the 2nd World War was very encouraging. As soon as an area was 
			freed from Japanese control, Rotarians at once took steps to 
			reestablish their clubs.<br>
			<br>
			The clubs in the three Rotary Districts, 96, 97 and 98 which were 
			the first ones to be readmitted to Rotary International membership 
			after the war, were the Rotary Clubs of Hong Kong, Shanghai, Hankow 
			and Beijing. The three districts were jointly supervised by the 
			first post-war Districts Governor, again in the person of the late 
			Dr. C.T. Wang.<br>
			<br>
			The following year the three districts were again separately 
			constituted, but in 1950 they were renumbered as District 57 for 
			South China, including the island of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. 
			District 58 for Central China and District 59 for North China. The 
			number of clubs in the three districts had grown to 22 with 1,091 
			Rotarians by the R.Y. 1950/51. Incidentally, Taiwan was grouped with 
			Japan in the prewar days.<br>
			<br>
			The Rotary Club of Hong Kong was suspended during the Pacific War 
			after operating for ten years since 1931, but revived in 1946. It 
			sponsored the Rotary Club of Macau in 1947 and the Rotary Club of 
			Kowloon in 1948. The first postwar club in Taiwan was organized in 
			1948.<br>
			<br>
			The situation in China deteriorated tremendously and the Rotary 
			movement on the China mainland came to a complete standstill 
			following the Communists coming to power in 1949. Later, when only 
			four of the 22 postwar clubs in the three districts were able to 
			function, with one each in Hong Kong, Kowloon, Macau and Taipei, 
			Rotary International saw it fit to remove the district status of our 
			area on July 1, 1951. The late Dr. Arthur Woo was appointed by R.I. 
			as its first Administrative Advisor for the Hongkong-Macau-Taiwan 
			area.<br>
			<br>
			Determined to regain district status, Rotarians in Hong Kong and 
			Taipei exerted greater efforts in promoting new clubs. The Rotary 
			Club of Hong Kong sponsored the Rotary Club of Hongkong Island East 
			and the Rotary Club of Hongkong Island West in 1954, while the 
			Rotary Club of Taipei at the same time succeeded in organizing 
			eleven additional clubs in Taiwan. As a result, Rotary International 
			decided to constitute the clubs in Hongkong-Macau-Taiwan area under 
			District 345, effective as from 1st July 1960 when we had altogether 
			17 clubs with 764 Rotarians. Its first postwar-district governor was 
			the late Rtn. K.T. Kwo from <br>
			Taipei. Just a coincidence, the writer of this article was inducted 
			into Rotary in the same year - 1960, hence he had the opportunity to 
			witness the reinstatement of a new district - 345.<br>
			<br>
			Rotary had been growing fast in Taiwan after the 2nd World War and 
			it had branched out another two new districts, viz., District 346 in 
			Central Taiwan and District 347 in Southern Taiwan in the years 1978 
			and 1984 respectively.<br>
			Due to the rapid growth, the number of Rotary clubs mushroomed to 
			101 in District 345 (Hongkong-Macau-Northern Taiwan) during the 
			Rotary Year 1986/87. It was just impossible for a district governor 
			to oversee all these clubs, hence a new district was born, known as 
			District 348 (Northern Taiwan) whereas District 345 remained 
			unchanged, except the area covers only Hongkong-Macau with a total 
			of 27 clubs as from 1st July 1987 under the leadership of District 
			Governor Raymond Wong.<br>
			<br>
			At present, there are 48 clubs in District 345 (renumbered 3450) 
			which comprises of 6 in Macau and 42 in Hong Kong. With the 
			reunification of Hong Kong to China since the handover of 
			sovereignty on 1st July 1997, Rotary has been reinstated in China 
			under the Special Administrative Region of China starting with 42
