		Clubs within the 'mother' District 1050</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">It covers a small geographical 
		area from the plains of Cheshire, through the industrial part of 
		Lancashire and Greater Manchester to the infamous moors of Saddleworth 
		and of course the famous TT course on the Isle of Man.<br><br>The 
		District has many places of interest including the Peel Tower in Bury 
		which was erected in honour of Sir Robert Peel. Sir Robert reorganised 
		the London Metropolitan police force and from whom originated the 
		terminology 'the British Bobbie' after his first name, and Tynwald, the 
		oldest parliament in the world at St. John's in the Isle of Man.<br><br>
		There is also the famous 'Gracie Fields' theatre in Rochdale and of 
		course 'Wigan Pier'. The district is not only commemorating the past but 
		looking to the future with the new 'Lowry' Centre in Salford and a 
		special 'Peace Centre' in Warrington which was built following the 
		difficult times in that town some years ago.<br><br>Since January 1986 
		the Rotarians in District 1050 had been working on laying a solid 
		foundation on which to build District 1280. The first District Governor 
		was Norman Wellens who said in his inaugural address 'Rotarians of 
		District 128 your continued support is essential to maintain and always 
		improve our district in the years to come'.<br><br>That improvement has 
		not only been seen in the formation of new clubs (the District has 
		fiftyone clubs at present - four of these in the Isle of Man) but also 
		in the Service of Rotarians within the local and world-wide communities. 
		The District has been fortunate in that four of its members have been 
		awarded Rotary's highest honour of the 'Service above Self' award.<br>
		<br>The District has been, and is continuing to be, active in all 
		aspects of service within Rotary and has developed both Community and 
		International projects, which have been extended within Rotary in Great 
		Britain and Ireland. Amongst some of these are the 'Daffodil Planting' 
		scheme and the 'Rotary Shoe Box' scheme.<br><br>It is actively involved 
		with 'Youth Activities' and has carried on the 'Summer Camp' which was 
		started in District 1050 in 1947 and is the longest serving camp within 
		Rotary International. Young people from all parts of Europe attend a 
		camp (ironically over the past few years held in District 1050) for two 
		weeks during July and August to join in fellowship and international 
		understanding.<br><br>The District has three Rotaract Clubs, and two 
		Interact Clubs. They give service within the local and world-wide 
		communities and support Rotary projects. Recently one of the members of 
		Rotaract went on a trek with the Nepal Trust carrying out valuable work 
		for the trust and another member went on a Group Study Exchange to New 
		Jersey, USA. One of the Interact Clubs went out to the Czech Republic to 
		work in a Children's home.<br><br>Since 1990 the District has been 
		supporting 'Life Education Centres' which is a health and drug 
		prevention education programme designed for primary school children. The 
		first mobile unit was borrowed and now the District supports six mobile 
		units which are operated through two charitable trusts. Each year over 
		75,000 children in 200 primary schools hear and remember the messages of 
		keeping healthy and avoiding drug misuse and abuse.<br><br>Many large 
		community events are carried out within the District and these not only 
		provide finance for community projects but also serve the community. 
		Perhaps two of the well known events are the 'Saddleworth Show' in 
		Saddleworth and 'Rotaraid Day' in Ramsey. The District also 
		substantially supports 'Kids Out'.<br><br>Continuing within the aspect 
		of Community Service 'Sports for the Disabled' is supported with a 
		'North West' sports day which is held in St. Helens and a team is chosen 
		to represent the area at the finals in Coventry. Over the past few years 
		the team has achieved third place and one of the team members became a 
		world champion in his own field of weight-lifting, and more recently out 
		team won the National Finals.<br><br>The District chose not to merge the 
		Community and Vocational Service committees and as a consequence, have 
		retained a strong sense of identity within both. The District 'Youth 
		Activities' Committee looks after such service as 'Youth Speaks' and 
		this has further strengthened the Vocational Committee. Over the past 
		few years there have been public debates, behind the scenes visits to 
		research establishments and a 'Science Extravaganza' for young people.<br>
		<br>Within the service of International the District has supported all 
		aspects of world community service and in particular in recent years a 
		mobile clinic in Uganda and a kindergarten in Romania. It has been 
		successful in winning the 'Connecticut' Trophy awarded for International 
		Service by Rotary International in Great Britain and Ireland.<br><br>The 
		principles of International Understanding have been extended through a 
		Group Study Exchange programme each year which has ranged from India to 
		Japan, Uganda to Finland, to name but a few, and exchanges are proposed 
		with India and Poland.<br><br>The District, as many others, has it's own 
		successful web site and within the area of Communications one of the 
		clubs has been awarded RIBI 'Public Relations' award and also an RI 
		'Public Relations' award.<br><br>Since the majority of the clubs within 
		the District are mainly inland towns the District Conferences are held 
		in seaside resorts outside the District such as Llandudno, Scarborough 
		and Southport. The conferences are well supported with nearly 1000 
		delegates attending. For the first time in District 1280 the Conference 
		in 2000 was held in Douglas which was very special as the District 
		Governor, Harry Pease, is a member of the Rushen and Western Mann club, 
		one of the Isle of Man clubs.</td>
