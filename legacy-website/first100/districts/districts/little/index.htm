		<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Sergeant Geoffrey Bernard William Little 
		retired from the New South Wales Police Service in 2001. &nbsp;Little joined the New South Wales 
		(Australia) Police Cadet Corps on August 13, 1962. 
		He was sworn in as a Probationary Constable on his birthday, June 8, 
		1965 and was promoted to `Sergeant Third Class' on Valentine's Day, 
		February 14, 1982.&nbsp; He says; &quot;Somebody loved me!&quot;.</p>
		<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Geoffrey retired at the equivalent Rank 
		of Second Class/Sergeant/Staff Sergeant/Incremental Sergeant&nbsp;&nbsp;after 
		nearly 40 years with the New South Wales Police. &nbsp;He is sixty something 
		years young, long time divorced, has a grown daughter and son - AND a 
		couple of mortgages. <br>
		<br>
		Little has been recognised Internationally for his contribution 
		to `Community Based Policing' and is an Honorary Deputy 
		Sheriff-Lieutenant, Ozaukee County Sheriff's Department, Wisconsin, 
		U.S.A.; Honorary Sergeant, Northern Constabulary, Inverness, Scotland; 
		Honorary Lieutenant Colonel (Superintendent), Philippine National Police 
		(PNP) attached to the Office of the Presidential Consultant on Police 
		Affairs, Presidential Security Group, Malacanang Palace, Manila, 
		Philippines; and Honorary Deputy Chief, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police 
		Department, Indiana, USA.</p>
		<p>Sgt Geoffrey Little was dubbed The Smiling Policeman by the press in 
		1977 when his boss busted him for smiling too much during traffic 
		duties.</p>
		<p>Yesterday, a strange twist of fate brought the policeman face to face 
		with his past. A portrait painted of him for the 1977 Archibald Prize by 
		artist Phillip Cooper was found at Nowra Waste Dept on Monday, destined 
		for landfill.</p>
		<p>&quot;I was sitting here in my office and got a phone call&quot; enthused 
		Sergeant Little. &quot;The boys from Nowra were coming up to pick up some 
		glocks, some new pistols, and the painting was in the back of the car.&quot;</p>
		<p>Mr. Steve Foord, a retired ranger with the Shoalhaven Council and 
		retired Special Constable with the NSW Police, was at the tip on the 
		South Coast when he saw the painting.</p>
		<p>&quot;I was having a little look around when I saw it,&quot; he said. &quot;The 
		artist was throwing out these paintings he had. There were probably up 
		to 200 paintings in the pile.&quot;</p>
		<p>&quot;I just noticed the portrait with the police badge number and I 
		thought obviously the Police Department would be able to trace who it 
		was. I thought it was a very nice painting&quot;</p>
		<p>Sergeant Little, now at North Sydney, made headlines in 1977 when he 
		was told by a senior officer to stop being so happy. The then constable 
		would direct traffic on the corner of Bent and Young Streets for two 
		mornings a week, before choir practice. &quot;He told me I had a problem&quot; 
		recalled Little.</p>
		<p>He said, &quot;Geoffrey, you go around loving people and smiling too much. 
		You should be more like a policeman.&quot;</p>
		<p>Sergeant Little has never shied away from the profile created by the 
		furor. He has appeared on Romper Room and traveled the world promoting 
		smiles as a United Nations Ambassador of Goodwill. There have even been 
		media events in America, where he has directed traffic for the local 
		constabulary.</p>
		<p>Argyle Centre artist, Phillip Cooper asked him to sit for an 
		Archibald portrait. The painting never made it to the finals, but was 
		hung at The Rocks Mall for about 5 years.</p>
		<p>&quot;I used to go back quite a lot to see how it was going but then 
		Phillip moved to Nowra,&quot; Sergeant Little said.</p>
		<p>&quot;He asked me if I would like to buy it and he put a price tag on it 
		of about $300. In those days I didn't have $300 so I had to sadly wave 
		goodbye to a part of me.&quot;</p>
		<p><u><b>HIS ACHIEVEMENTS</b></u></p>
		<p>Apart from his founding the &quot;PoLPFR&quot;, Little has also been the 
		driving force for these additional world-wide activities -</p>
		<p style="text-align: center"><strong>ROTARY DISTRICT PEACE COMMUNITIES 
		PROGRAMME (RDPCP) </strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify">The Rotary District Peace Commmunities 
		Programme (RDPCP) has been a principal programme of Polepfor.&nbsp; The RDPCP 
		has undergone quite an evolution since the Project was first posted as 
		the Rotary Peace Project.&nbsp; After Little attended the Rotary Peace Summit 
		in Windsor, Ontario, April 2008, this program has progressed far insofar 
		as there is now a Proposal (Memorial) to the Council of Legislation (CoL) 
		to request the RDPCP become a Rotary International based exercise.&nbsp; The 
		Programme started in 1992 as a Rotary Club initiative out of the RC 
		Wagga Wagga - Kooringal D9700, then it became a Rotary District Peace 
		Communities Programme - and subsequently, began its enormous spread 
		around the world, mostly due to Little's perserverence, initiatives and 
		personal contacts.</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify">This is the programme with which Little 
		has developed his most ardent love affair and which, since his 
		retirement, he has devoted his time with the most extraordinary results.</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p style="text-align: center"><strong>THE EVILS OF DRUG ABUSE AND 
		ILLEGAL DRUG TRAFFICKING</strong></p>
		<p>The world-wide offensive being waged by Police and Law Enforcement 
		Agencies against illegal drug trafficking, drug abuse and the delivery 
		of `Drug Abuse Prevention' lectures and seminars to the youth of the 
		world, is a matter all Rotarians and members of Police and Law 
		Enforcement should be addressing. Prevalent in Cebu at the time was a 
		bout of Rugby sniffing (shoe glue), Cough Syrup abuse, Shabu (Marijuana) 
		and the `poor man's cocaine - ice, which has now become the scourge of 
		the drug scene here in Sydney.</p>
		<p>As Rotarians, the PoLEFoR is anxious to promote the involvement of 
		the proud &quot;Vocation of Police and Law Enforcement' in the work of 
		Rotary, and conversely, encourage those who might not be Rotarians, to 
		seriously consider Rotary involvement within their community.</p>
		<p>The 'Police/Law Enforcement Professionals Fellowship of Rotarians' 
		looks at assisting and complementing your own Rotary Service and helping 
		to promote and enhance your own personal Rotary programmes.</p>
		<p>Little engaged in one such activity in Cebu, Philippines, an exercise 
		conducted through the Cebu City Office of Substance Abuse Prevention (COSAP).&nbsp; 
		This and many other programmes are available for a Rotary input wherever 
		Rotarians may serve and of whichever Rotary Club you are a Member.</p>
		<p style="text-align: center"><strong>&quot;JUST SAY NO&quot; TO DRUGS PROGRAMME, 
		CEBU CITY, PHILIPPINES</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align: left">
		<img border="0" src="little02.gif" width="200" height="164" align="left">One 
		such activity&nbsp;has been&nbsp;the 'Just Say No' to Drugs' Programme in Cebu, 
		Philippines, formerly under the Chairmanship of Rotarian (former 
		Philippine Constabulary) Oscar C. Mabilog, Rotary Club of Metro Cebu. In 
		his constant battle to promote this programme, Little was instrumental 
		in creating the programme.</p>
		<p style="text-align: left">The now Late Rotarian Oscar Mabilog&nbsp;was an 
		Honorary Deputy Mayor of Cebu City and&nbsp;reigned for a number of years as 
		the Chairman of COSAP (Cebu City Office of Substance Abuse Prevention)</p>
