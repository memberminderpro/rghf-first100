            <td width="607">A SHORT HISTORY OF ROTARY DISTRICT 5650<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			On February 23, 1905, Rotary was started by Paul P. Harris in 
			Chicago, Illinois, and the idea quickly spread to other towns. As 
			additional clubs formed across the U. S., the organization became 
			called the &quot;National Association of Rotary Clubs.&quot; In 1910 the 
			fourteenth Rotary club formed in <b>
			<a href="../../clubs/cities/clubs/14lincoln.htm">Lincoln</a></b>, Nebraska. This was the 
			first club in what is now our District 5650, although at the time 
			there were no &quot;districts.&quot; Soon afterwards, Lincoln #14 began 
			organizing other clubs. In 1911 they helped start <b>
			<a href="../../clubs/cities/clubs/37omaha.htm">Omaha #37 </a></b>(or 
			&quot;Downtown,&quot; as it is often called today). In 1912 both clubs were 
			grouped in the same administrative division of Rotary. <br>
			<br>
			In those early days, Rotary clubs were men's luncheon and social 
			clubs, and Lincoln and Omaha set the stage for many future 
			&quot;Inter-City Meetings&quot; when they held a dinner dance in Omaha in 
			1912. By 1913, however, clubs in our division turned their attention 
			to community service.<br>
			<br>
			In 1912 Rotary clubs were established in Canada and Great Britain, 
			and the parent organization changed its name to the &quot;International 
			Association of Rotary Clubs.&quot; By 1915 Rotary had grown so large that 
			the first &quot;districting&quot; became necessary, and clubs in Nebraska and 
			Iowa were grouped into District #19. On February 23 of that year, 
			the Rotary Club of Omaha also chartered a new club, the Rotary Club 
			of Council Bluffs. It appears the first visit of an International 
			President to a club in an official district containing the Nebraska 
			and Iowa clubs occurred in 1915, when President Frank Mulholland 
			visited Omaha Downtown. <br>
			<br>
			In 1915-1916, redistricting placed all Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota 
			and South Dakota clubs into District #10. In this period, two 
			activities very characteristic of today's Rotary clubs developed: in 
			1915-1916 Omaha #37 members began their first &quot;vocational talks,&quot; 
			and in 1916 District #10's first District Conference was held--in 
			January, in Waterloo, Iowa. The following year, Orville Fee from 
			Lincoln #14 was selected Governor of District #10; he was the first 
			Governor to come from one of our current District 5650 clubs.<br>
			<br>
			District geography changed again in 1918-1919, when North Dakota was 
			split away from District #10. A new District #16 was formed to 
			encompass all Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota clubs. Clubs in this 
			District grew like wildfire during the late teens and twenties, and 
			District Conferences were held in such locations as Omaha, Des 
			Moines, Dubuque, and Sioux Falls. Some District Rotarians attained 
			international distinction at this time: when William Coppock of 
			Council Bluffs served as Rotary International 2nd Vice-President in 
			1921-1922, he became the first Rotarian from a club in our current 
			District 5650 to serve as a Rotary International officer.<br>
			<br>
			In 1922 our parent organization's name was shortened to &quot;Rotary 
			International,&quot; and continued growth again prompted redistricting. 
			For a year, all 78 Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota clubs remained 
			together under a new number (District #11)--the largest Rotary 
			district anywhere. Then in 1923-1924 the eastern two-thirds of Iowa 
			and the Scottsbluff, Nebraska, club were stripped away, and the 
			remaining Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota clubs gathered into new 
			District #19. In the twenties and thirties, Inter-City Meetings 
			remained popular, and collegiality was promoted with the beginning 
			of the first &quot;makeups&quot; at another club in 1927-1928. <br>
			<br>
			During the Depression of the 1930s, many Rotary clubs were forced to 
			disband, and those that survived often turned their community 
			service projects to assisting the down-and-out. In spite of the 
			Depression, in 1934-1935 the Annual District Inter-City meeting held 
			at Omaha attracted representatives from over 130 clubs. By 1935 most 
			clubs in District #19 scheduled their &quot;Changing of the Guard&quot; in 
			early July, and the presidents and secretaries of all 66 clubs in 
			the District were expected to attend a two-day &quot;District Assembly&quot; 
			(similar to our current PETS-SETS) later that month.<br>
			<br>
			In 1937-1938 the numbers of Rotary Clubs had grown to the point that 
			all Nebraska clubs except Scottsbluff were placed into their own 
			District #120, which by 1939 had 54 clubs. Rotary fellowship was so 
			popular then that 742 people attended the District Conference in 
			Omaha in 1940. The ensuing war years took a toll on Rotary, and 
			wartime events caused the cancellation of our District Conference in 
			1944. Following the end of World War II, the first Rotary Graduate 
			Fellowships (today called Ambassadorial Scholarships) were given in 
			1947. One of the first year's eighteen awards went to a young man 
			from Nebraska's District #120.<br>
			<br>
			The 1950s saw several changes in our area's Rotary life. In 
			1950-1951 many Iowa and Nebraska clubs in today's District 5650 were 
			placed into District #177; District Conferences moved to the fall; 
			new clubs appeared; and, for the first time, multiple clubs appeared 
			in several cities. Lincoln became the first city in District #177 to 
			have two clubs when it organized the Northeast Lincoln Club in 1953. 
			Two years later, Omaha #37 organized Omaha West. Another startling 
			development occurred when two Nebraska women were awarded Rotary 
			International Fellowships in 1955-1956.<br>
			<br>
			The immediate precursor to our current District 5650, District #565 
			took shape in 1956-1957. Of particular note was our district's 
			development of the Cadwallader Award in 1963. Endowed by Charles N. 
			and Ruth Cadwallader, this award recognizes an individual Rotarian 
			for his/her outstanding district contributions. In 1967-1968 Charles 
			Cadwallader was posthumously awarded the first Paul Harris 
			Fellowship in District 565. During the sixties, District 565 also 
			participated in new educational programs instituted by Rotary 
			International, such as the Group Study Exchange program. In 1969 we 
			hosted our first GSE Team, who came from Australia.<br>
			<br>
			During the 1970s, District 565 exhibited a more international 
			outlook, and the beginnings of significant World Community Service 
			and disaster relief projects can be seen at the District and club 
			levels. We joined Rotary International's HHH (Health, Hunger and 
			Humanity) program in 1978 and received GSE teams through the decade. 
			Clubs increased in the Omaha area, when Bellevue, Omaha Northwest 
			and Millard were chartered. Administrative changes also appeared, as 
			with the creation of &quot;District Governor Area Representatives&quot; 
			(forerunners of today's current Assistant District Governors). <br>
			<br>
			In the 1980s and 1990s, District 565 launched many disaster relief 
			efforts, sending aid to those in need as close as Grand Island, 
			Nebraska, and West Virginia and as far away as the Philippines and 
			Algeria. In 1980 all 37 clubs in our district participated in a 
			Christmas food drive, and all 37 clubs took part in an HHH project 
			later that year. One of Rotary's best-known programs in the Plains 
			states, BRAN (Bike Ride Across Nebraska), was organized by Omaha 
			Northwest in 1981 in conjunction with District 563 (western 
			Nebraska) to benefit the Nebraska Heart Association. District 565 
			embraced the Polio Plus campaign announced by Rotary International 
			in 1985 and gave so freely to the Rotary Foundation that in 1989 the 
			District boasted 787 Paul Harris Fellows. Club growth led us to 45 
			clubs in 1990, and, when women were admitted in 1989, membership 
			promised to expand as well. <br>
			<br>
			In 1991-1992 our district received a new number, 5650, but since 
			then its programs generally have followed patterns established in 
			the 1980s. Between 1991 and 2005, District 5650 Rotarians have 
			focused on community and world service, on Polio Eradication, on 
			building the Rotary Foundation, and, most recently, on Rotary's 
			up-coming 100th Anniversary. Two noteworthy innovations have taken 
			place in our District 5650 since 2000, however: our first female 
			District Governor, Doris J. Heineman, took office in 2001, and at 
			about that same time District 5650 began to make use of the 
			world-wide web. <br>
			From our meager origins in 1910, with one club in Lincoln, Nebraska, 
			and its 13 charter members, today District 5650 measures 45 clubs in 
			two states, with some 2,538 members. And, certainly, over the past 
			95 years, Rotarians in District 5650 and its precursor districts 
			have put &quot;Service above Self&quot; and made a world of difference in many 
			people's lives.<br>
