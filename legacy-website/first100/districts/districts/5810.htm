            CLUB HISTORIES</p>
            <p class="auto-style2">At one time or another, clubs 
            within the states of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and New Mexico 
            have been included in the same District. The final territorial 
            change was made in 1973, when small counties in Oklahoma and 
            Arkansas were removed from District 581.  </p>
            <p class="auto-style2">From 1973 'til 1991, 
            District 581 included the following counties ...Dallas, Fannin, 
            Rockwall, Ellis, Hunt, Collin, Grayson and Kaufman. In 1991, Rotary 
            International &quot;ran out of numbers&quot; and a (0) was added to all 
            districts, hence, 581 became 5810.</p>
            <p class="auto-style2">The 2003 - 2004 District 
            Governor is Mark Healy, who has been Camp Director for Camp RYLA

      &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">The Addison Rotary 
      Club was chartered in August, 1984 with thirty-five charter members. We 
      were founded by Prestonwood Rotary Club. Of our sixteen past presidents, 
      fourteen are still active members and contributors to our club. We 
      currently have fifty-nine active members.</p>

		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">One of our first 
      community projects was to help marshal and act as Master of Ceremonies 
      for the Addison Christmas Parade. At least 50% of our members participate 
      in this event each year. The parade serves as a large contributing factor 
      in building synergy within our club and aligning us with the Town of 
      Addison.</p>

		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">One of our early 
      fundraising events was a booth at the annual Addison Fourth of July Kaboom 
      Town. Over time we tried a variety of events including face painting, a 
      fishing booth and the ill-fated watermelon sale. Fortunately, we did learn 
      from our mistakes and finally found a winner with the basketball foul shot 
      booth. This was another event well attended and enjoyed by club members.

      <p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">Since 1988, the 
      Addison Rotary Club has honored students from local high schools with a 
      Student of the Month Award. Each month a student is selected and is 
      invited along with his or her parents to our meeting. We ask the student 
      to give a brief summary of their high school experience and their plans 
      for the future.</p>

		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">Our first foray into a 
      major community service project was the Addison Rotary Courteous Driver 
      Award Program. This was a program involving The Town of Addison and 
      Addison Police Department. Officers would literally present courteous 
      drivers with a $20 check from the Addison Rotary Club for driving 
      courteously. The Program ran from December 1st to Christmas morning for 
      five years. The officers enjoyed this program because it was a chance for 
      them to have a positive interaction with motorists and thank courteous 
      drivers.</p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">As we evolved as a 
      club, we wanted to have a bigger impact in our community and the decision 
      was made to start a golf tournament. Twelve years ago the Addison 
      Rotary-Bryan's House Open Golf Tournament was born. This tournament is for 
      the sole benefit of Bryan's House, a medically managed day care and 
      24-hour care facility for children with HIV/AIDS. The Bryan's House Open 
      was an undertaking far larger than we as a club had ever done. 
      Fortunately, all our members have participated in one way or another from 
      day one. The first tournament netted in excess of $25,000. Going into our 
      12th year we have donated over $1.2 million to Bryan's House. The Addison 
      Rotary-Bryan's House Open Tournament has become one of the premier Rotary 
      events in our district. The tournament has also facilitated the raising of 
      an additional $2 million for Bryan's House from the community and has made 
      Bryan's House a household name. </p>
      <p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">The Addison Rotary 
      Foundation not only supports Bryan's House, but also numerous other 
      charities in our community. One hundred percent of our members are either 
      Paul Harris Fellows or Paul Harris Sustaining Members and approximately 
      40% are Rotary Foundation Benefactors.</p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">This year in 
      September, the Rotary Club of Allen Sunrise will mark its fifth 
      anniversary as a new club in District 5810. In 1997, largely due to the 
      efforts of Linda Engle of the Allen Club, assisted by Cindy Alexander, the 
      Rotary Club of Allen Sunrise was chartered. Barbara Erwin, then 
      Superintendent of the Allen Independent School District, served as the 
      club's first president. We were also graced that first year with the 
      guidance of Plano Rotary Club member L.B. Broach who was assigned to 
      monitor our club by the District. In September 1997, thirty members were 
      installed as charter members; five years later we still have six of those 
      members. Over the next four years Kenneth Fulk, Danny McLarty, Kevin Kerr, 
      and John Sprague followed in the office of president. Marty Wiarda, 
      president elect, will begin his service as president in July.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The history of the 
      Rotary Club of Allen Sunrise is the story of many individuals stepping up 
      and volunteering their time and their talent to respond to the needs of 
      our community and of Rotary International. It is a special honor for the 
      club to actively participate in the RYLA program, Rotary Youth Leadership 
      Awards. Each year, under the leadership of Steve Shafranek, the Sunrise 
      Club sponsors two students, juniors at Allen High School, to participate 
      in the week-long RYLA leadership camp. We are especially proud to have 
      these students return and report on how much the experience has meant to 
      them. </font></p>

		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">This year, with 
      membership being a major focus of Rotary International, the club organized 
      a New Member Orientation workshop under the direction of past president 
      Kevin Kerr. While many neighboring clubs were invited, attendance came 
      from the two Allen Clubs and the McKinney Sunrise Club. District 
      Governor-Elect Pete Snider, Past District Governor Jim Griffith and a 
      variety of service chairpersons from the two Allen clubs conducted the 
      event. Plans are under way for follow-up orientation workshops.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">It is with great pride 
      that the Rotary Club of Allen Sunrise partners with the Allen Independent 
      School District in its volunteer work. For several years our members 
      teamed up with the Channels Program in mentoring students at the middle 
      school level. Under the direction of past president Kenneth Fulk, each 
      year a growing number of our members continue to volunteer to read 
      one-to-one with students at Rountree Elementary School. </font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">On the national front 
      this past year, in response to the horrible events of September 11, 2001, 
      the club was able to make a financial donation to the Red Cross of America 
      for its relief fund. And internationally, the club has arranged a small 
      matching grant from the District to assist Dr. Tom Brian of Allen with his 
      Send Hope dental service program to the indigenous in the far reaches of 
      Honduras. </font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Some of the club's 
      community service activities over its five-year span include: hosting an 
      appreciation breakfast for the Allen Fire Department and Police 
      Department, adopting a mile and maintaining a clean-up schedule for a road 
      in Allen, and volunteering for the Allen Chamber of Commerce Northern 
      Lights Christmas holiday activity. This year, club member Larry Becker 
      accepted the challenge of Rotary International and organized the first Art 
      and Poster contest for middle school age children. The two Allen clubs 
      sponsored contestants who went on to be judged at the District level. He 
      followed this success by arranging for the Sunrise club to hold a Four-Way 
      Speech contest and send a contestant to the annual District competition.

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The premier annual 
      activity of the club, largely through the efforts of club member Susie 
      McCloud over the years, and community service chair Bill Rushing this 
      year, has been to sponsor the annual Allen Christmas parade. This is an 
      activity which we partner with the noon club to accomplish. It's such an 
      exciting event to see nearly a hundred floats and many hundreds of kids 
      make their way through Allen with the Rotary banner leading the way.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">We have seen many 
      members come and go over five years, and many have made significant 
      contributions. One such member is Pat Schmoranz, a past district governor 
      from Florida, who provided much insight and guidance over the past year. 
      To these and, to all our members, we say thank you.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Bonham Rotary Club was 
      organized in April, 1921, largely through the efforts of Ralph A Risser, 
      who was sold on Rotary and its motto, &quot;He profits most who serves best.&quot;
      </font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Mr. Risser worked 
      constantly until he had secured twenty-five members, the required number 
      for formation of a Rotary Club. That same club has functioned faithfully 
      and well since, profiting much by its well-laid foundation as well 
      instilled in the hearts and minds of its membership by Mr. Risser. 
      Unanimously, Mr. Risser was elected to serve as the first president of the 
      Bonham Rotary Club. </font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Other officers of the 
      club were M.A. Taylor, vice-president; Charles R. Inglish, secretary; and 
      Bland Smith, treasurer. The first meeting of the club was held in the 
      basement of the U.S.A. Presbyterian Church, with Mr. Risser explaining the 
      aims and ideals of the organization. </font></p>

		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">At this initial 
      meeting, he explained that the only obligations imposed by Rotary are the 
      maintenance of high business standards, a militant of good citizenship, an 
      unswerving loyalty to one's government, active participation in all 
      matters before the club, and active membership in craft, civic, charitable 
      and commercial organizations. </font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The official charter 
      date is May 1, 1921 for the Bonham Rotary Club. The club at the time of 
      its admission to membership of Rotary International was situated in 
      District 18. Subsequently, it was located in the following districts, each 
      change becoming effective in the year stated: 1922, District 13; 1925, 
      District 48; 1937, District 128; 1949, District 188, 1973 District 581;

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Bonham Rotary Club 
      has been active since its inception with the community and particularly 
      the youth. As early as 1922, a boys club was established in order to 
      encourage boys to stay in school, stressing the importance of education. A 
      student loan fund was established enabling many students to attend 
      college. Other youth participation has been with Boy Scouts, Camp Fire 
      Girls, Little League Baseball, the Bonham Free Kindergarten, Special 
      Olympics and DFYIT (Drug-Free Youth in Texas).</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Countless community 
      projects have been completed since the beginning of this club. Still to 
      this day efforts are made to contribute to the community and youth. The 
      Bonham Club has participated in the Youth Exchange offered through Rotary 
      International as well as the Group Study Exchange. What a pleasure it is 
      to meet and share ideas with our visiting guests from other parts of the 
      world. In the past Rotary was composed of men only, but soon asked the 
      business women to become a part of Rotary. The women of Bonham Rotary are 
      active and participate fully as officers and directors. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Mr. J.O. Tate served

      Fleming, to Otis Engineering on Beltline in Carrollton. With Robert H.

      the kitchen of the old meeting place. After eating cold catered chicken

      Christopher, and a number of members of the Carrollton-Farmers Branch 
      Rotary Club, including Dana Mackison, founded the District 5810 Camp RYLA 
      at Lake Bridgeport. Embrey was the first Camp Director, and Innes was the

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&quot;A movement that had

      successful head Tuesday afternoon when the organization was perfected by

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Since its founding,

      the world. The Club has been a leader in the Ambassadorial Scholarship 
      program, continuing to successfully identify and sponsor these outbound 
      scholars. In addition, the Club provides two college scholarships annually 
      to Commerce high school seniors. A Mother's Day program provides

      has participated in youth exchange, mini-exchange, Group Study Exchange, 
      Camp Enterprise, and Camp RYLA. We are currently assisting a local group

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Coppell Rotary 
      Club was chartered in June 1983 and from the beginning established a 
      strong partnership with the citizens of Coppell to make their city a 
      better place to live, work, attend school and play. </font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Mr. Ron Beggs, Club 
      President, and the other charter members of the Club determined early on 
      that in order to make any significant contributions to Coppell they would 
      have to develop fund raising projects to finance their community support 
      programs. In December of that first year the Coppell Rotarians came up 
      with the idea of sponsoring a community wide event to celebrate the 
      heritage of their small but growing city. On May 5, 1984, the inaugural 
      Coppell Rotary Founders Day celebration was hosted by the Club and became 
      a major fund raising project for many years to come. </font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In the ensuing years 
      the Coppell Rotary Club made major contributions to the community parks, 
      schools, YMCA and public library. Coppell Rotarians built a pavilion at 
      Andy Brown Park, provided picnic tables and BBQ grills for other 
      neighborhood parks, built a walking bridge at another park, made a major 
      financial contribution and provided a significant amount of labor in the 
      construction of Kid County community playground, and donated over 3,000 
      trees to the City through the District 5810 Rotatree Program.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Coppell schools 
      received a banner machine, art display stands, overhead projectors, 
      sprinkler systems for school playgrounds, running tracks, backstops, 
      football goal posts, maps, globes and financial grants. In addition, 200 
      Coppell High School seniors have been recognized for their academic, 
      athletic, school and community achievements as Students of the Month and 
      25 seniors received college scholarships from the Coppell Rotary Club.</font></p>

		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Coppell Rotary 
      Club was a major contributor to the community YMCA from the very 
      beginning, providing much needed financial support to establish and 
      maintain effective programs for the citizens of Coppell.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Coppell Rotarians

      furnishing a library conference room and providing over $28,000 in 
      outright financial grants.</font></p>

		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In addition, the 
      Coppell Rotary Club has made significant contributions in the 
      International Avenue of Service. The Club has participated in teacher and 
      student exchange programs as well as GSE Teams. The Club sponsored student 
      exchanges with the countries of Belgium, France, Norway, South Africa, 
      Thailand and Japan. Also, the club partnered with the Rotary Clubs of 
      Carrollton-Farmers Branch and Cozumel, Mexico, providing much needed 
      school supplies as well as assisting with upgrading the local school 
      facilities in Cozumel. Finally, the Club sponsored Jennifer Bayne, who 
      received a Rotary Ambassadorial Scholarship, which allowed her to further 
      her studies in England. </font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Club recognizes 
      the important role of the Rotary Foundation around the world and has long 
      been a strong supporter through the Paul Harris Fellow Program, resulting 
      in sixty-six current and former members and spouses becoming Paul Harris 
      Fellows. Additionally, the Club currently has six Rotary Foundation 
      Benefactors.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Coppell Rotary 
      Club has accomplished much in the past nineteen years, but certainly one 
      of the most significant accomplishments has to be the contributions made 
      to more than forty young people from the Coppell High School who were 
      sponsored to attend the Rotary Youth Leadership Award (RYLA) camps. Since 
      the very beginning of RYLA in District 5810, this Club has provided a 
      number of camp counselors and assistant counselors to support this effort, 
      as well as equipment, supplies and transportation. The investments made in 
      the lives of the young people from Coppell who have attended RYLA Camp 
      will live on and certainly pay dividends to the schools, communities and 
      companies they associate with in the years ahead.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Club has followed 
      a tradition of believing that a smaller club can make tremendous 
      contributions to the world community, and affect the lives of many, many 
      people, by helping others. As it was put some years later, &quot;Small Clubs 
      can Change the World&quot;. The Club has attacked this daunting task by:</font></p>

		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">First - In order to 
      finance our goals, the Club has raised a great deal of money through golf 
      tournaments, silent auctions, the sale of Christmas gifts, donations from 
      local businesses, project sponsorships, fruit sales, and on and on.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Next - Selecting 
      projects that will accomplish our goals such as:</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Obtaining a RI 
      matching grant to equip the charity hospital in Monterrey, Mexico with new 
      neo-natal care equipment which, each year, saves the lives of over 300 
      special-needs babies.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Obtaining a RI grant 
      to help found a camp for children with Down's Syndrome in Monterrey, 
      Mexico. Monterrey had the highest incidence of Down's Syndrome of any 
      major city in North America.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">By participating in 
      Rotary International's fight against Polio by having every member 
      contribute $1,000.00 (a Paul Harris Fellow) to eradicate this dread 
      disease; the results have been magnificent.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">By recognizing the 
      work of others in our community who fight to &quot;Change the World&quot; through 
      programs such as the &quot;Unsung Hero's Award&quot; program where 13 citizens of 
      Dallas have been awarded Paul Harris fellows as a &quot;thank you&quot; for their 
      efforts in helping others. </font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">

      to a student in Macedonia, hosting Russians to learn about the free 
      enterprise system, hosting foreign exchange students, sponsoring 
      Ambassadorial Scholars, etc.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">By providing the 
      leadership of our members Mark Healy and Tom Bright to help found, and 
      then direct District projects such as Camp RYLA, The Salvation Army Angel 
      Tree project, etc.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">By providing thought 
      provoking guest speakers who stimulate and educate our members. We have 
      learned about the life of a missionary in new Guinea; the lack of hospital 
      facilities in India; boxing reform from the International Secretary of the 
      World Boxing Council; about the Palestinian and Israeli's problem; about 
      Christians and Muslims on the resolution of a very difficult situation, to 
      name just a few. The way to peace is through the understanding of others. 
      The way to help is &quot;do something&quot;.</font></p>

		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Over the years, the 
      Club has established a tradition of District leadership, with members 
      serving on the District Round Table every year since it's founding, 
      chairing the District Conference, acting as chair person of Camp RYLA, 
      acting as Camp Director for Camp RYLA, and providing an Assistant District 
      Governor. And last, but certainly not least, we are proud to announce that 
      one of our own, Mark Healy, will be the District Governor of Rotary 
      District 5810 in 2003-2004. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">So, in the end, the 
      question we ask ourselves is &quot;have we met our goals of service over the 
      years&quot;? The answer is a resounding &quot;yes&quot;, thanks to many dedicated members 
      who have worked diligently towards that goal. One of the secrets of our 
      success has been the retention of a core of members, including 9 past 
      presidents who are still active members and two founding members (up to 2 
      years ago). </font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">But we are not 
      finished. New projects come to our attention every year, and we must 
      continually meet these needs in order to continue pursing our goal of 
      &quot;Changing the World&quot; through our good works. To borrow a line from the 
      Jaycee Creed, we are proud to say that &quot;Service to Humanity is the Best 
      Work of Life&quot;.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Bob Burnam was

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Father and first 
      president of the Denison Rotary Club was Dr. J.E. Aubrey, a colorful 
      Denisonian whom older residents still remember. Dr. Aubrey was pastor of 
      the First Presbyterian Church and later served as interim secretary of the 
      Chamber of Commerce. But it was as a lecturer that Dr. Aubrey stood the 
      tallest. He was a member of the once flourishing Chautauqua lecture group 
      and toured much of the country as a speaker. Dr. Aubrey called four 
      friends together to lay plans for the club: G.O. Morgan, head of the 
      Denison Peanut Co., Guy Alexander, Insurance, Jack Tinsman, Druggist and 
      H.E. Ellis, Editor of the Denison Herald. They invited others to each 
      lunch meeting and soon they had enough men interested in Rotary to begin. 
      The club was granted probationary membership by the National Organization, 
      and on June 1, 1916, a charter was granted. </font></p>

      $4,000 are awarded annually to outstanding high school students. Thelma 
      Braun, our pianist for seventy years, knowing the good works of the 
      Denison Rotary, bequeathed the club $15,000 that was used to establish

      1964. Direction for this action came from Jack F. Gibson, Governor of 
      Rotary District 581, to officials of the Oak Cliff Rotary Club. The South 
      Dallas Rotary Club charter was approved by Rotary International effective 
      February 1, 1965. Over the 37 year life span of what is now the DeSoto 
      Rotary Club there were changes in meeting places as well as of club names. 
      The first name change for the club occurred September 28, 1971, when 
      Rotary International approved the renaming of the South Dallas Rotary Club 
      to Dallas Red Bird Rotary Club. Over a ten year period the club's 
      membership changed to predominately DeSoto businessmen and organization of 
      a new Rotary Club in Duncanville in 1983 formed the basis for another name 
      change and subsequent relocation. Effective January 28, 1984, Rotary 
      International approved the new name of the Rotary Club of DeSoto.

      through 4-H Club and Future Farmer of America projects, Community Easter 
      Egg Hunt, Scholarships to graduating high school seniors, as a Lead Donor

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Rotary Club of 
      Duncanville had its start while Rotarian Cliff Boyd was serving as mayor 
      of Duncanville. Cliff saw the need for a Rotary club in Duncanville and 
      took the steps to bring a club to our city. Cliff was a member of the 
      Redbird Rotary club (now DeSoto) and was serving as President-Elect of 
      that club. Believing that Duncanville needed a club &quot;. . . to serve the 
      community in which its members were most active in business and social 
      life.&quot; He asked the Red Bird club for their endorsement, which they freely 
      gave, and also agreed to serve as the sponsoring club. </font></p>

      chartered on August 4, 1983, becoming the 40th club in District 5810. The 
      charter banquet was held on September 27, 1983 at the Holiday Inn in 
      Duncanville. Cliff Boyd was inducted as the charter president, John Davis 
      as club treasurer and Jiten Shah as an original board member.

      Kamm served as governor during the year 1997-98 and Jim Tow has served as 
      District Governor during 2001-2002. The club was among the first to induct 
      a female member into the club, with Patsy Ross becoming a member in 
      1987-88 under the leadership of President Dr. Jim Tilger. Mary Fae Kamm

      equipping and maintaining the facility. The city approved and this park 
      has become part of the Duncanville tour circuit. The park was renovated in

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Club fund raising 
      projects have been popular city events also. The first fund raiser, which 
      continues to this day was a fish fry. This event is so popular with the 
      citizens that many of them come early and remain until late. The original 
      Dixie Chicks have been featured as entertainers. During Rotary year 
      1997-98, the club initiated the community flag program. At the present 
      time, the club displays nearly 500 flags for Duncanville residents on five 
      major holidays, with plans to continue expanding into additional 
      neighborhoods. These fundraisers have provided funding for myriad 
      community youth projects, scholarship programs, Camp RYLA scholarships, 
      outstanding vocational service projects and other community based 
      activities. Probably the most impressive single-event fundraiser was the 
      raffle of a 2002 Chrysler PT cruiser which produced $18,000 toward the 
      expansion of the city Hopkins Senior Citizen Center.</font></p>

      in a precedent-setting ceremony. It was precedent-setting because the 
      charter was issued by Rotary International President Roy Hickman of 
      Birmingham, Alabama, with two international directors present. The 
      directors were Ben F. Hormel, of McCook, Nebraska, and Cornelius Myerink 
      of The Netherlands. There were a great many Rotarians from all over the 
      world in attendance. R.I. had just concluded the International Convention 
      in Houston, and Hickman promised Pete Brewster, a personal friend of his 
      and the first president of the Ennis Club, that if he would form the club, 
      they would come to make the presentation. It was also a homecoming of 
      sorts to Hickman, because his wife, Dorothy Dunkerley, was reared in 
      Ennis.The Greater Dallas Rotary Chorus provided the entertainment to the 
      many dignitaries gathered at the SPJST Hall for the ceremony.</font></p>

      Both agencies support citizens in North Dallas, Farmers Branch,

      Sellers, who served as sergeant-at-arms for a long period, used to stand 
      near the serving line and offer visitors a spoonful or two of his 
      mother-in-law's sweet relish. No one dared to not accept it, and all who 
      sampled it found it to be three alarm hot. Bay patrolled the tables and 
      fined any unwary visitor who did not eat his sweet relish and brag about 
      how good it was. Some repeat visitors cheerfully paid their fines in 
      advance rather than scorch their tonsils again. The club has always 
      maintained an informal atmosphere in keeping with the prevailing attitude 
      of the community.</font></p>

		The project that the

      Members of the Frisco Rotary Club go to each elementary school in Frisco 
      and show the children what the 4 Way Test is and how it applies to them. 
      With the assistance of skits, audiotapes, and coloring books, the Rotary 
      members relate the 4 Way Test to the students. At the completion of the 
      program, the students have a good understanding of the 4 Way Test ...(1) 
      Is it the truth? (2) Is it fair to all concerned? (3) Will it build good 
      will and better friendships? and (4) Will it be beneficial to all 
      concerned? This program has already exposed over 2,200 students to &quot;the 
      Test&quot; and a small glimpse of what Rotary is all about. </font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Our club initiated our 
      main service project in 1976. We strive to provide some holiday happiness 
      for some needy children in our community. Originally, we presented some 
      Christmas stockings filled with fruit and candy for several special 
      education students in the Garland Independent School District. The 
      district administrators have always been helpful in selecting the children 
      and families needing assistance.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Today, we jointly work 
      with the Garland Noon Exchange Club in having an annual Christmas party 
      for over 70 elementary students. The students are selected from several 
      elementary schools based on their needs. The students and their teachers 
      are invited to join us for a special Holiday luncheon program.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Shriners allow us 
      to use their facilities at the Hella Temple in Garland. In the past years 
      their clowns have helped entertain the students. Cake, ice cream, and 
      drinks are served during the party. Local high school choirs and jazz 
      bands present the main entertainment for the students.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Of course Santa visits 
      and hands each student a bag full of presents chosen especially for him or 
      her. Each student is totally surprised and full of excitement for each and 
      every gift they receive. The teachers help us by providing a list of the 
      things each student needs and their sizes. They appreciate everything they 
      receive. Coats, jeans, shirts, blouses, socks, shoes, sweaters, school 
      supplies, toothbrushes, and at least one or two toys are given to them.
      </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">This project usually 
      receives 100% participation from our club and involves lots of 
      organization. Several gatherings are needed for shopping, sorting and 
      wrapping. Our club chairperson for the party is quickly selected at the 
      beginning of the year so everything is planned early. Our club's main 
      fundraiser provides the funds for this service project.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Garland Lakeside is 
      proud to be the home club of PDG Ray Kneggs, who served the district as 
      governor in 1984-85. 1985 was the year that &quot;kicked off&quot; Rotary 
      International's PolioPlus program, with the objective to raise 
      $120,000,000 to inoculate children against Polio in the 3rd World 
      countries. Ray was very active in the International program and traveled 
      to Delhi, India in 1998 to participate in the inoculation program. Ray has 
      served as President's personal representative to 15 District Conference in 
      the United States and other countries, and has served as an Aide to

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">March 11, 1940, was 
      the birthday for the Grand Prairie Rotary club. The club was chartered 
      with 20 members and Dewey Millar as its charter president. The city was a 
      bustling community with a growing aviation industry and a small, but 
      growing military presence.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Hitler was active in 
      Western Europe and the Axis was making the western world very uneasy. 
      President Roosevelt was leading the country as it continued its slow 
      recovery from the Great Depression of 1929. Unemployment stood at 27 
      percent across the United States.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Grand Prairie needed a 
      service club and Rotary looked like just the ticket. The club moved around 
      looking for a home and found several over the years. The Veteran's 
      Memorial Center, where the club meets today, became the club's permanent 
      home in the 1960's. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club has not had a 
      District officer in its history although many have served the District in 
      various capacities over the years. More than 100 of our members have 
      become Paul Harris Fellows over the years, contributing nearly $110,000 in 
      support of the Rotary foundation and its worldwide projects.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">During the 1970's the 
      club began programs in support of youth. These efforts lead to the 
      establishment of two scholarships for the boys of the month, one from each 
      of Grand Prairie's two high schools. Those scholarships continue to the 
      present and have grown to $1,000 each, annually. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In the 1980's, the 
      Grand Prairie Rotary Club began expanding its horizons; first, by 
      sponsoring the Tuesday Grand Prairie Metro Rotary Club. The club was 
      formed with 24 members and Clyde DeLoach, one of our former members, as 
      the charter president. The second expansive activity for our club was our 
      initiation into the Rotary Youth Exchange Program. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Our involvement in 
      this area has brought us exchange students from Italy, Germany, France, 
      South Africa, Australia, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Japan and Argentina. In 
      addition, we have hosted several GSE teams and sent many U.S. students to 
      study abroad. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Through the years, our 
      club has been noted in the international student area as a host club for 
      Texas State Fair weekends. This was accomplished by working with members 
      of a number of district clubs to maximize this opportunity for the 
      students.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In 1996, our club was 
      instrumental in getting a $40,000 grant to place a medical unit in the 
      territories outside of a major city in South Africa. This grant purchased 
      the vehicle, provided for its staff and delivered polio vaccine and other 
      medicines for the treatment of peoples in rural areas of South Africa.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Also during the late 
      1990's, the Grand Prairie Rotary was able to fund the establishment of an 
      in-school dental education and treatment program for some 600 youngsters 
      who would not have otherwise been treated. This program has since been 
      expanded to include a portable dental chair, a seal coat program for 
      fourth graders as well as the contribution of needed dental services by a 
      host of local dentists. The program was conceived and is executed by a 
      woman Rotarian who is also a dentist. This program is now funded annually 
      by a very successful golf tournament that also honors a local citizen.

      to demonstrate service above self through their involvement in every 
      worthwhile program in this community. </font></p>

      <span class="auto-style2">The Rotary Club of Grand Prairie Metro</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Grand Prairie 
      Metro Rotary Club was chartered in 1985 through the vision of a small 
      group of like-minded individuals who felt that there was a need for a 
      second club in Grand Prairie. With 30 charter members, two of whom are 
      still members, the Grand Prairie Metro Rotary Club hit the ground running 
      in more ways than one.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">While the club was 
      diligent in assisting with various charitable events and Rotary programs 
      such as PolioPlus, food drives, water projects and others, the leadership 
      of the club hit on the idea of holding a 10K race.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Over the past 15 
      years, the Grand Prairie Metro Rotary Club has set itself apart by hosting 
      the annual Lake Joe Pool 10K, 5K Run &amp; 5K Walk, Fun Run &amp; Pumpkin Fest (or 
      simply, the &quot;Pumpkin Run&quot;). In an age where road races experience 
      relatively short lives, the Pumpkin Run has grown and become a staple in 
      the community.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Over these 15 years, 
      the club has been able to funnel more than $60,000 back into the community 
      for use by local charities. Most of the coordination of the race comes 
      from volunteer help so that expenses can be kept at a minimum. Through the 
      years, the run has taken on a festival atmosphere with music, door prizes, 
      awards, food and the inclusion of the school challenge that encourages 
      local schools to compete. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Held every October, 
      the run is set against the picturesque backdrop of Joe Pool Lake and the 
      developing community of south Grand Prairie. Averaging anywhere from 800 
      to 1,000 runners, the race has become one of the more anticipated races in 
      the Metroplex.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Other significant work 
      has come from a longtime relationship with Cam Gray and Orphans of the 
      World. Cam has been instrumental in using his connections with Rotary 
      clubs in Central America and Mexico to further the cause of Rotary on an 
      international scale.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Through Orphans of the 
      World, the Grand Prairie Metro Rotary Club has been able to obtain 
      matching funds that help provide food, hygiene products and educational 
      supplies to impoverished areas of Central America. Through a joint project 
      of OTW and an Oklahoman Rotary club, the Metro Rotary has recently shipped 
      approximately $80,000 worth of wheelchairs and supplies to Central 
      America. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Today, the Grand 
      Prairie Metro Rotary Club stands at just under 30 members. Since 1985, the 
      club has seen a number of ups and downs including a period that almost 
      witnessed the club's demise. But in a testament to the strength and 
      commitment to the vision of those individuals who began the club many 
      years ago, the current membership has doggedly pursued those things that 
      make the club viable and relevant in today's society: service above self.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Even following 
      September 11, when local charities and non-profits saw financial inflows 
      decrease and even stop, the Grand Prairie Metro Rotary Club through its 
      ongoing service to the community through the 10K run was able to 
      distribute more than $8,500 back into local charities.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">While the existence of 
      the Grand Prairie Metro Rotary Club may not be long, its commitment to the 
      community of Grand Prairie and the ideals of Rotary International are 
      timeless.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Grayson County 
      Rotary Club was chartered on June 23, 1987 as a morning breakfast club. 
      The club was sponsored by the Sherman Rotary Club during the tenure of 
      District Governor L. T. White, a member of the Sherman club. Lyle Froese 
      was the charter club president. There were 27 charter members. The club 
      reached its peak membership of 51 in 1997 but currently maintains an 
      average membership in the mid 40's.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">During its brief 
      history, the Grayson Club has become active in a variety of community and 
      international projects. The club has hosted Group Study Exchange Teams 
      from British Columbia in 1993 and South Korea in 1998 and is scheduled to 
      host the team from the Philippines in 2002. In 1996, the club sponsored a 
      Rotary ambassador to Germany as part of the mini-exchange program.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In 1994, the Grayson 
      club established the Hubbard Endowed Academic Scholarship in honor of 
      member and retired Sherman ISD Superintendent Wendell Hubbard and his wife 
      Marjorie. The scholarship provides a four-year stipend totaling $3000 to a 
      local college student and is awarded every odd year. The fund maintains a 
      balance of over $20,000. The club also awards an annual $500 academic 
      scholarship, originally earmarked for students attending Grayson County 
      Community College.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club held its 
      spirited, weekly meetings at Steak Kountry restaurant from 1991 until 
      2001. Currently, meetings are held at Kelly's restaurant in Sherman. One 
      of the special events that the club holds is an annual Valentine's 
      Sweetheart Banquet, first held in 1990. In addition to various awards 
      presented to club members, a community volunteer service award is 
      presented as well as the charitable recipients of the club's fund raising 
      efforts.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Grayson Club was 
      long known for its annual fruit sale fundraiser, which was discontinued in 
      2001. That same year, a new fundraiser was begun; a nighttime golf 
      tournament, which will become an annual event. Probably the most memorable 
      fundraising venture was the Winston Cup stock car race held at the Texas 
      Motor Speedway in 1999. Over thirty club members worked in a concession 
      stand for approximately 15 hours to only clear a little over $2,000.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Since its inception, 
      the Grayson Club has earned six Presidential Citations. The club continues 
      to play a vital role in serving the needs in Grayson County. Service to 
      the international community will continue with the &quot;computers in schools&quot; 
      project in Mongolia which is expected to be initiated in 2002.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The newest Rotary Club 
      in District 5810 held its Charter Banquet on October 19th at the Cedar 
      Creek Country Club near Kemp, Texas. This club is located in Kaufman 
      County, east of Dallas, and was sponsored by the Mesquite Club. Past 
      District Governor Herb Kamm, of Duncanville, and Mike Slaton, of Mesquite, 
      were instrumental in the organization of this club and have been driving 
      to Kaufman for meetings and helping to build membership for over a year.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Both of these men, 
      along with other Rotarians and spouses from all over the district, were in 
      attendance at the Charter Banquet, in addition to the charter members of 
      the Kaufman Club and their spouses. District Governor Paul Yeager 
      presented the Club its Rotary charter.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club meets weekly 
      at noon at the Kaufman Family Restaurant and invites other Rotarians and 
      guests to join them. If you know you will be attending, Charlotte Gilmore 
      would appreciate a call by Tuesday morning (972) 932-7954. Officers of the 
      club are Charlotte Gilmore, President; Kimberly Stevenson, 
      president-elect; Ralph Hooks, treasurer; James Higgins, Jr., immediate

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club wants to 
      express appreciation to all those who attended the Charter Banquet and to 
      all the clubs which sent greetings and gifts. It is a very humbling 
      experience to be on the receiving end of gift giving. The club hopes to 
      reciprocate by giving to their community in Kaufman and to the wider 
      community, District 5810 and Rotary International.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The history of the 
      Greenville Rotary Club (established in 1925) is almost the history of 
      Greenville and Hunt County. The first airport in our county was 
      established on US 69 just on the Southeast corner of Greenville, across 
      the street from Forest Park Cemetery. John D Middleton, one of our first 
      presidents, sponsored an African-American Park on North Johnson Street, 
      which was very successful and widely used. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In 1928, our club 
      launched a drive for a new Court House, which stands today and is a 
      tribute to any city. We sponsored 4-H boys in the purchase of calves; 
      profit from the sale of these calves provided funds for several students 
      to attend college. We sponsored a Boy Scout troop at Boles Home. During 
      World War II, we purchased sporting equipment and established a club room 
      at Majors Field.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">One of the highlights 
      of our activities was the district conference we held in Greenville in 
      1956. We had visitors from almost every club in the district. We had an 
      array of prominent speakers. Beau Baumier, a past District Governor, was 
      the life of the party. Senator A. M. Aiken, from Paris, Texas, one of the 
      sponsors of the Gilmer-Aiken law, which was a great improvement in 
      governing education in Texas. Two outstanding speakers, Ed Gossett, a 
      district judge from Dallas and John Ben Shepherd, Attorney General of 
      Texas added much dignity to our conference. The main speaker for our 
      evening banquet was Ollie Oberg from Sydney Australia, vice chairman of 
      Rotary International. It was one of the best Rotary speeches I have ever 
      heard, and he held the audience of approximately 400 spellbound. The 
      Rotary-Anns were entertained lavishly, with style shows, musical programs 
      and an excellent speech by Mrs. Lamar Hunt of Dallas. Dinner music was 
      provided by the East Texas String Ensemble. Another great District 
      Conference was held in 1964. Our distinguished speaker was Herbert J. 
      Taylor, the author of the 4-Way Test. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Some of the other 
      accomplishments of our club: we assisted our Mexican neighbors at the time 
      of their devastating earthquake; gave generously to the &quot;Fish&quot; effort and 
      repaired homes for the elderly. We established the Fletcher Warren Park, 
      honoring our local ambassador to over 15 foreign countries. He was born 
      and reared in Wolfe City, near Greenville. We have rendered valuable 
      assistance to the elimination of polio, world-wide, thanks to our valuable 
      Rotarian, Ken Hart. We have hosted delegations from India and South 
      America and have numerous flags from foreign countries. We have programs 
      honoring our teacher of the month and the outstanding high school 
      students. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">We sponsored our 
      neighboring club in Farmersville in 1939 as well as the Greenville Morning 
      Club in 1992. We have sponsored a little league baseball team and sent a 
      boy to Boys State for years. We actively participate in Clean Greenville 
      and have been involved in winning three annual governors awards to our 
      city. Our club has had one district governor, Ed Edmondson. He had 
      attended 8 national conventions and was well known in Rotary 
      International. Our club now has several Paul Harris Fellows. Ken Hart has 
      provided 8 and it is a pleasure to see the 8 stars opposite his name. We 
      were active in sending Bill Moyers to Edinburgh, Scotland, for his 
      graduate degree. He became one of the most famous journalists in the 
      world. His &quot;Bill Moyers Journal&quot; is read world-wide.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">One of the secrets to 
      the success of our club is the brilliant array of speakers. Some of them 
      are: Bob Stewart, then President of the First National Bank of Dallas; Mr 
      Ernest Baughman, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas; Dr 
      Arthur Smith, Economist from SMU; T. L. Austin, Chairman of Texas 
      Utilities and later Chairman of Brown &amp; Root of Houston; E B Germany, 
      President of Lone Star Gas Company and later his successor William P. 
      McCord. We had Boone Powell, Senior Administrator of Baylor Hospital in 
      Dallas and John Ben Shepherd, Attorney General of Texas, just after he was 
      selected one of the 10 outstanding men in the USA. We have had J.J. 
      Pearce, W.T. White, Nolan Estes and Linus Wright, all superintendents of 
      the Dallas ISD. We had Charles Pister, President of the Republic National 
      Bank of Dallas, just after he had finished his term as President of the 
      American Bankers Association. We had Vernon Baird, President of Mrs 
      Baird's Bread Company. Other outstanding guests have been Ed Fjordbak, 
      President of Communities Foundation of Texas; Dick Bartlett, Vice Chairman 
      of Mary Kay Cosmetics and then President of the Nature Conservancy of 
      Texas and Andy Sansom, Executive Director of Texas Parks and Wildlife. I 
      would say that the speech by Barry Thompson, retired Chancellor of Texas A 
      &amp; M, College Station was the best that I have ever heard in my 58 years in 
      Rotary. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">I think we have one of 
      the best Rotary Clubs in Texas.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&quot;The article above&quot; 
      was written by Paul Mathews, 98 years old with 58 years perfect attendance 
      and easily the most revered person in the Greenville Noon Rotary Club. It 
      took Paul nearly 20 years to be invited for membership in 1944 because of

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">From the very 
      beginning, the club felt it was special, and should be seen that way. 
      Accordingly it held its charter night banquet on a special evening, 
      February 29, 1980, on the campus of Austin College in Sherman. Principal 
      speaker for the evening was Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, who was a personal 
      friend of the Dallas Rotarian and past president George Cullum. George was 
      the driving force behind the organizing of our club, which was formally 
      sponsored by the Rotary Club of Dallas. The occasion drew over 500

      these men and women represent the best in business and professional people 
      in the community.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">We are particularly 
      proud to have 20 charter members still active in our club (one had to let 
      his membership lapse for several years, but has since rejoined our group), 
      including two with perfect attendance since the club's inception.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Over and above our 
      specific accomplishments, as important and as impressive as those may be 
      for a club of our size, Rotarians of the Hurricane Creek Rotary Club have 
      done something more important. We have provided leadership by example and 
      character in many key areas of our communities.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">As Paul Harris wrote: 
      &quot;Good works are not all there is in Rotary; good works are expressions 
      only of something beneath. Beneath the good works of Rotary, there is an 
      invisible power; it is the power of goodwill.&quot;</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">February 16, 1937 
      (Charter Day), Hitler marched into Germany; Stalin ruled Russia with an 
      Iron Fist; Roosevelt began his second term. Irving was not a &quot;one street 
      town&quot;.....it actually had nine streets.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The 30's brought 
      depression, drought, desperadoes (Bonnie and Clyde), and dust, but not 
      despair. Unemployment stood at a hard core 27 percent across the nation. 
      Irving, with all its burden, would birth a struggling and sorely needed, 
      active service organization, The Irving Rotary Club.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Dallas Club 
      organized The Irving Club, ceding the territory north of Dallas and West 
      of the Trinity. Later, our club sponsored Grand Prairie Rotary on March 
      11, 1940 and on March 21, 1972, North Irving Rotary Club (now Las Colinas 
      Rotary). In 1983, our last child, The Coppell Rotary Club was born.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">We first met at the 
      Methodist Church, then moved to the new WPA Civic Center, the first 
      eleven-story Irving Bank Tower in 1966. Since 1976, we have met every 
      Thursday noon at the Las Colinas Country Club. Our club has spawned two 
      district governors....Leo Jackson (1965-1966) and Hubert Owens 
      (1977-1978).</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Our main thrust has 
      always been youth; Irving Rotarian Don and Mary Oberlin hosted one of the 
      first exchange students in our district in the late '70s, Deiter Koontz 
      from West Germany. We have about 15-20 scholarships each year (including 
      technical), school partners, mentoring and all the things you can imagine.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Jim Wilcox became 
      chairman of the District's Rotary Foundation committee on July 1, 1984. 
      Until then our club had been credited with only 35 Paul Harris Fellows and 
      had never had a Sustaining Member. Only eight of the PHFs had been donated 
      by the individuals. All others had been given by the club to honor the 
      member. During the following Rotary year, 25 PHFs and 30 SMs were added, 
      resulting in a little over $32,000 being sent to the Rotary Foundation. At 
      that time, it was an all-time record for giving to TRF by any club in 
      District 581. Six years later we had 140 Fellows and 65 SMs, including 14 
      members of Jim's family. For his diligence and dedication, he received the 
      Rotary Foundation's District Service Award in 1984-85 and received both 
      the Citation for Meritorious Service and the Distinguished Service Award 
      from the Trustees of the Rotary Foundation.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Finally, we have been 
      a good Rotary Club. We have grown from 15 members to a pretty steady 150 
      (big enough to do big things, small enough to know each other). We have a 
      huge volunteer force (boards, committees, elected officials, hospital, 
      etc.) We are known for our award-winning weekly bulletin, The Blade (sent 
      world-wide), and our outstanding programs and high number with perfect 
      attendance, one with 48 years and one with 51.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The history of Irving 
      Rotary is a thousand stories of men and women who enhanced their own lives 
      as they spread the story of Rotary throughout the world these past 
      sixty-five years.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Las Colinas Rotary was 
      founded under the sponsorship of the Irving Rotary Club. We owe a 
      particular debt to Mike Donnelly, Ben Thomas, Bill Esslinger and Hubert 
      Owens of that club. Doyle McKinney and Bill Nicol kept an eye on our early 
      development. The charter was issued to Irving North Rotary but the name 
      was later changed to Las Colinas.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club has been 
      characterized by service, good fellowship and recruiting and acceptance of 
      members from all walks of life. In 1986, Patty Landers became our first 
      woman Rotarian. Our Tom Roberts (38 years of perfect attendance and the 
      District 5810 Ambassador Scholarship chairman for 15 years) has been 
      instrumental in bringing foreign students to town and recruiting scholars 
      to go abroad.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">We view service to 
      community as an opportunity to build fellowship and friendship within the 
      Club. For many years the Irving Christmas Classic race brought as many as 
      6,000 runners to Irving in early December. There's something about 
      temperatures in the 20's and 30's that creates a bond with other club 
      members working on cold assignments along the course.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In 1999 our club 
      applied for foundation fund for the Reading is Fundamental program. In 
      addition to selecting books appropriate for local schools, our members go 
      to the school to read to students. This fits in with a mentoring program 
      for our partner Travis Middle School that has provided our members with 
      opportunities to help in the classroom.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Being located in the 
      Las Colinas business community has been a mixed blessing. We are 
      privileged to have dynamic people come to Rotary through our club. We are 
      saddened when their careers cause them to move on, but we take 
      satisfaction in the fact that most go on to join Rotary at their new 
      location. Even with a high proportion of members with less than 3 years of 
      membership, we are proud that half of our members are Paul Harris Fellows 
      or Sustaining Members.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Irving Sunrise 
      Rotary Club today has 51 members. For the last five years they have 
      received the Presidential Citation for fulfilling the Rotary objectives. 
      In 2001 they were awarded the Community Service Award by the District for 
      their project &quot;Back to School&quot;. The United Methodist Church distributes 
      over 3000 uniforms &amp; supplies to disadvantaged children in the Irving 
      School District. The members of the club volunteered time and efforts to 
      distribute the clothes and supplies to these children. The project lasts 
      for four weekends prior to the beginning of school in August. The children 
      have to be screened and approved prior to obtaining their uniforms and 
      supplies. The club also donates $2000 to this project to help with the 
      cost of the uniforms.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Another project with 
      the Irving School District that has been very successful is a &quot;Graduating 
      Seniors Clothing Drive&quot;. The members donate gently used sports jackets, 
      white shirts and shoes to the graduating seniors that are in need of an 
      outfit to wear to graduation. This is done in conjunction with the school 
      counselors. Some of the other community service projects are: reading to 
      the children of Lively Elementary School, assisting with the Irving Senior 
      Citizens Center with their yearly Miss Mature Irving Pageant, purchasing 
      software for the Irving Public Library that is used in maintaining records 
      and administrating their English as a Second Language program. Other 
      projects in the district are Angel Tree, Irving Police Officer of the 
      Quarter, RYLA, tree planting in the River Bottom little league ball park. 
      Yearly we send a participant to the Four Way Speech Test Contest. We 
      purchased bicycles for the Irving Police patrol at Austin Middle School. 
      We also support Irving Cares with a monetary donation every Christmas for 
      the needy. We have also participated in a $1500 donation to the Rotary 
      Club of New York City for the 9-11-01 tragedies. We also award a Rotarian 
      each year with the &quot;Doyle McKinney Award&quot; for outstanding commitment to 
      our club and the community. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In International 
      Service, we have supported the Group Study Exchange program by hosting the 
      teams from India, Philippines, Italy &amp; India. Marie Zeiler led the GSE 
      team to India in 2001. Doyle McKinney led the GSE team to India in 1975. 
      We have two matching grants in the works: First, with Bucharest Romania to 
      provide the Children's Burn Hospital with equipment. Second, with India to 
      provide the schools in Ichalkaranji with 38 computers. We have sent a 
      container through Medisend to Honduras for hurricane Mitch disaster 
      relief. We sent a pallet of food to Honduras for the hurricane Mitch 
      disaster relief. And a water treatment system was sent to the Honduras to

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In 1983, a man by the 
      name of Dick Baggett came to Lancaster as the new hospital administrator. 
      At that time there was no Rotary Club in the city of Lancaster. Dick 
      changed that and on April 25, 1984, the Lancaster Rotary Club received 
      their Charter.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The first meeting 
      place for the club was at the hospital. The charter members of the club 
      are the following: Hospital Administrator-Dick Baggett, School

      Valley College, Country View Golf Course, Benavides Restaurant. Currently 
      the club has a room on the second floor of the Regions Bank Building and a 
      catering person prepares our meals.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Members of the club 
      have been recognized several times by the Texas Senate for their 
      contributions to the youth of Lancaster. This recognition was for the Free 
      Enterprise Program which was presented to Juniors and Seniors at Lancaster 
      High School. We were also recognized for our work with Best Southwest 
      Scholars.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club has been very 
      supportive of the Lancaster Library and have had unanimous participation 
      in the Toto Run to raise money for the library.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club participates 
      in the city-wide efforts to pick up trash from our roadways. We have 
      recently taken a stretch of Highway 342 and will be caring for this 
      monthly. We will have signs along the road stating we have adopted this 
      portion of the highway.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">We are also strong 
      supporters of the Lancaster Outreach Center. Each year we give $1,000 
      scholarships to deserving Lancaster High School Students. This year we 
      will give a scholarship to a Cedar Valley College single mother and will 
      pay for her daycare while she is attending her classes. Over the years, we 
      have been big supporters of Camp RYLA.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">We have two major 
      fund-raisers each year. We have a golf tournament at our local golf course 
      and we provide flags for five holidays a year to subscribers. After the

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Rotary Club of 
      McKinney was organized May 30, 1919 with 28 members and admitted to the 
      International Association of Rotary Clubs as club 519 on July 1, 1919. The 
      sponsoring club was the Rotary Club of Dallas and their special 
      representative to the McKinney Club was Walter C. Temple. The District 
      Governor at the time was Thomas S. Reed, Jr.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">From the beginning 
      this club has encouraged students to succeed in their studies. In the 
      1920-21 year, the club paid the expenses for three Collin County boys to 
      attend the annual &quot;short course&quot; at State A &amp; M College. In 1932-33, the 
      club began inviting one high school student to attend the club meeting for 
      one month, then another student was chosen for the next month. This was to 
      acquaint the boys with the world of the club and aims of Rotary. Still 
      today the club recognizes two students each month, one boy and one girl, 
      for high academic honors. In 1958-59, the club helped a student through 
      the University of Texas with the club's student loan fund. In the early 
      1990s, the club was the first endowed fund through the McKinney Education 
      Foundation to assist McKinney students to further their education. Shortly 
      after the club began the Letter Sweater Program to honor all sophomores, 
      juniors and seniors who had maintained a 90 average the previous year. Now 
      named the Academic Excellence Program, it is funded by a symphony concert 
      each winter and major donations. Each student receives a stadium blanket 
      the first year and chevrons in subsequent years. A $3000 scholarship is 
      awarded annually through the Al Ruschhaupt Memorial Scholarship at this 
      event. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In 1932-33, the club 
      also formed illiteracy and extension committees. Today we continue with 
      members who volunteer to teach illiterate adults to read through our city 
      library. In 1946-47, the club sponsored a library for the public schools, 
      selecting books to be donated. In 1952-53, the club held Career Day at the 
      high school with panel discussions on various vocational activities. Each 
      member donated a book to the public library on his vocation. This 
      tradition continues in 2001-2002 by the club donating a book each week in 
      honor of our speaker to a K-12 campus which represents a microcosm of the 
      MISD, the ACT Academy and Library.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">International work has 
      also been a major focus for the Rotary Club of McKinney. In 1929-30 the 
      International Service committee began bringing our first representatives 
      from other countries. In 1939-40, the club participated in the Institute 
      of International Understanding promoted by the International Service 
      Committee. In 1952, the club sponsored a panel discussion each month on 
      international affairs which was broadcast over the local radio station. In 
      1963-64, the club began corresponding, in Spanish, for years, with clubs 
      in Mexico and Latin America, especially with District 417 in Mexico. The 
      club also supported the Holy Family School, a mission preschool in 
      McKinney. The club continues to host one international student each year 
      and assists in sending our incoming President to the RI International 
      Convention each year.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In 1965-66, the club 
      initiated the Rotary Club Citizenship Award Scholarship and the Rotary 
      Club Educational Award (Neilson Award) in the amount of $200 each. In 2001 
      then-President John Lovetere began the Good Samaritan Award Program in 
      which citizens nominate any non-Rotarian for service above self. This 
      person, selected by the Rotary Club, is featured in the newspaper, invited 
      to the club meeting and awarded $100. This program garnered the District's 
      Most Innovative Project Award in 2001 and continues today.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Our distinguished 
      member George S. Kadera has been honored by Rotary International with the 
      prestigious &quot;Service Above Self&quot; Award, and served District 5810 as 
      Governor in 1995-1996.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Rotary Club of 
      McKinney has the heart and soul Paul Harris must have envisioned in 
      Chicago those many years ago. This club has a long history with a common

      the organizers. We began with a total of 38 members. At first the Club met 
      at the Stonebridge Country Club on Mondays at 7:30 am. In January 1997, 
      the meeting place was changed to Luby's Cafeteria, and the meeting day to 
      Wednesday. In January 2000, another move was made to Eldorado Country 
      Club. This location was selected for member convenience, food and 
      atmosphere. Since 1992, membership has fluctuated, at one time reaching a 
      low of 20. Stressing membership retention, we now have 41 members.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club has been most 
      active in all services, participating in Foundation activities, RYLA, Camp 
      Enterprise, Literacy, Scholarships, GSE, 4 Way Test, Community and 
      International programs. Our main emphasis in Community Service has been on 
      service to the children of our community. We have contributed on a regular 
      basis to Samaritan Inn (a homeless shelter) and Habitat for Humanity. One 
      of our major projects is the Christmas Angel Tree.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">To raise funds, we 
      have sold Passbooks, Christmas trees, art, household items and fruit. We 
      also held a golf tournament. Our largest and most successful fund raising 
      project has been the &quot;Flag Program&quot;. We were one of the first clubs in the 
      district to have a program of this type and many other Rotary Clubs have 
      adopted it. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In 1993, the club 
      sponsored a youth exchange student from San Pablo, Brazil, Ricardo 
      Bevilacqua, for a one-year program. Host families were Healys and 
      McDonalds. In 1995, we sponsored another student, Miki Hayashi, from 
      Japan. The host families were the Yeagers, Crenwelges and Capps.

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In August 1993, Paul 
      Yeager and Fred Bahrenburg received the first Paul Harris Fellows. To 
      date, the total of Paul Harris Fellows is 30 with 52 Sustaining members 
      and 7 Benefactors.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Presidents of 
      McKinney Sunrise, in chronological order from 1992 through 2002 are as 
      follows: Tom Healy, Bob Flinchbaugh, Paul Yeager, Linda Terry, Pat Beaman, 
      Frank Shushok, Chuck Koehler, Larry Offerdahl, Jeff Caserotti &amp; Steve 
      Mitas. In addition, the club has two Past District Governors - Nathan 
      White, Jr. (1979-1980) and Paul Yeager (1999-2000). </font></p>

      <span class="auto-style2">The Rotary Club of Mesquite</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1"><b>
      <span class="auto-style2">Chartered June 30, 1959</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The first thoughts for 
      a Rotary Club in Mesquite took place at a &quot;Home Hospitality&quot; gathering 
      during the 1958 Rotary International Convention in Dallas. Past District 
      Governor Briggs Todd and Sam Scothorn, both district level officers in 
      then Rotary District 581 set forth to make the club happen... and it did.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Mesquite/Big Town 
      Rotary Club met first at the cafeteria at the Big Town shopping mall. Most 
      of the early members were store managers and tenants of Big Town. One of 
      the most impressive speakers of early times was the founder of the J. C. 
      Penney Stores, James Cash Penney.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">One of the interesting 
      challenges of the past (the early seventies), involved the Rotary Club of 
      Terrell. The Mesquite Club and the Terrell Club embarked on an attendance 
      drive. Each club showed 100% attendance for a six-month period. Terrell 
      eventually won. John Todd, representing the Mesquite Rotary, plunged into 
      the Holiday Inn swimming pool, fully clothed for the losing effort!</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Over the years, the 
      Mesquite Club has worked on a variety of fund raisers for its Scholarship 
      efforts: selling chili and Frito Pies at the Rodeo Parade, cutting and 
      selling watermelons at an Eastfield festival, parking cars during the 
      Balloon Festivals. One unusual fundraiser was an old fashioned Turkey 
      shoot. The club purchased ten 22 caliber rifles. Tickets were sold for a 
      fixed number of shots. The shooters shot at targets with frozen turkeys 
      and hams as the ultimate prizes. The most profitable fundraiser is the 
      Annual Rotary Bike Ride which raises funds to meet the needs of various 
      projects within Mesquite.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In years past, the 
      Mesquite Rotary has contributed to a wide range of community needs which 
      have included a Fire Safety House to enable the Mesquite Fire Department 
      to demonstrate fire safety to M.I.S.D. students and many other Mesquite 
      children. A $1,500...and growing...scholarship is provided for each of the 
      five high schools. Annual Christmas gifts are given to a multitude of 
      Mesquite Social Service clients. The club has also donated directly to the 
      Mesquite Social Services with contributions, equipment purchases and food. 
      Other recent contributions have included the Epilepsy Foundation and the 
      New Beginning's Center for abused women. One of the largest single 
      contributions was given to Meadowview School, which is a special needs 
      school. Mesquite club members participate in community service projects 
      such as the Reading Program at Motley Elementary School in Mesquite. 
      Motley is a Title One school in which club members share their time in 
      reading to the students.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club continues to 
      grow with a great attitude and fun spirit. It is always a joy and delight 
      to attend and participate in the Mesquite Rotary Club. The Mesquite Rotary 
      moved from time to time for different reasons. In years past, the club has 
      met at the old Holiday Inn on Highway 80 near Town East Boulevard. From 
      there it moved to Eastfield College and met in the faculty lounge, thanks 
      to Jerry Hanson from the Registrars Office at the college. From there, the 
      club moved to its current facility, the Dallas Athletic Club.

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Here's a short story 
      which shows how a Rotary Club can &quot;make a difference&quot; in an 
      individual.....yes, one person at a time!</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&quot;It was in June, 1983, 
      when I received a call from the president of the Midlothian Rotary Club, 
      who told me that there was a young girl in Midlothian High School who had 
      heard about Rotary International's Youth Exchange program and would like 
      to know more about it. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">I was serving as 
      District Youth Exchange Officer at the time; I called and invited the 
      student, Loretta Rogers, to be my guest at the Rotary meeting the 
      following Tuesday. I met a very shy young lady, 16 years of age, and told 
      her about the program. Loretta was the only child of a single mother, who 
      was very concerned about &quot;sending&quot; her daughter to a foreign country to be 
      hosted by a man's organization. Loretta had never been out of the state of 
      Texas. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">I, too, was concerned 
      about accepting a person, immature for her age, to go on a program that 
      involved so many uncertainties. However, I also knew that we had an 
      established program in our District to prepare a person for that year 
      abroad, and that the receiving district was prepared, as well, to take 
      care of all but the most unusual situations. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Loretta was placed in 
      Norway, left in August of that year; as with the others, I kept in contact 
      with her during the year. Shortly after she returned, she attended our 
      &quot;de-briefing&quot; session, and I was literally amazed to find a &quot;different&quot; 
      person, actually talkative and even fluent in a foreign language.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">That fall, the 
      Duncanville Rotary Club called to ask me to give a program on Youth 
      Exchange at their Rotary meeting and suggessted that I bring a student. I 
      do remember getting up at 4 A.M. one cold December morning, driving to 
      Midlothian to pick up Loretta and making the 7 A.M. meeting on time. 
      (Breakfast club meetings have never been a favorite!)</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Loretta actually gave 
      the entire program; her presentation was very well received. (She even 
      spoke a little Norwegian, to prove she could!)</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Yes, Rotary 
      International, through its Youth Exchange program, has been responsible 
      for influencing the lives of over 75,000 young people since the program 
      was started in 1965. </font></p>

      <span class="auto-style2">The Rotary Club of Oak Cliff</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1"><b>
      <span class="auto-style2">Chartered July 12, 1945</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The primary reason for 
      the formation of the Oak Cliff Rotary Club was to foster the ideals of 
      Rotary and bring their benefits to the Oak Cliff Community. Another strong 
      motivation was that the members of the Dallas Rotary Club needed a 
      convenient club for make-ups and had urged its formation. Thus on July 12, 
      1945 the Oak Cliff Rotary Club was chartered with 27 members. The first 
      president was Starr Armstrong followed by Roy Hill, Leven Deputy, Frank 
      Delaney and William Durrett. Twenty five years after being chartered, four 
      original members were still active in Oak Cliff Rotary. They were William 
      ( Bill) Durrett, Dr. Bob Lorenz, William ( Bill) Roberts and William R. 
      Roberts. William R. Roberts is the only remaining charter member, he has 
      been a member for 56 years.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club meetings were 
      at the Cliff Towers, followed by Wedgewood Towers for a few years before 
      moving to the Torch Restaurant for about 13 years. In 1981, the club moved 
      to Weiss Auditorium at Methodist Hospital, and in 1998 moved to the &quot;Top 
      of the Cliff&quot; in the Bank of America-Oak Cliff Tower.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club has had 
      several members with almost 50 years perfect attendance before their 
      passing - William Durrett and Clifton Rogers. Presently Dr. William R. 
      (Bob) Durrett is approaching 26 years perfect attendance. Dr. Kent Pollard 
      and Richard C. (Dick) Pierce are approaching 25 years perfect attendance. 
      Currently, and over the years, the members have supported the Rotary 
      Foundation with annual giving, Paul Harris Fellowships, and Benefactors.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Besides the years of 
      perfect attendance, William Durrett served as President then 
      Secretary-Treasurer of the club for over 30 years. He was principal of 
      Kimball High School until his retirement. He was a dedicated Rotarian who 
      set an example for all of Rotarians to follow.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Another Rotarian whom 
      we are proud to have had as long-term member was Clifton (Cliff) Rogers 
      who passed away in 2001. Besides his 50 years of perfect attendance, he 
      was known throughout the district for his work with the Rotary Foundation 
      and inspirational speaking throughout the state.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Like all other Rotary 
      clubs Oak Cliff Rotary has rendered too many community projects to name 
      them all. Among the more significant ones are scholarships for Oak Cliff 
      students, sending students to RYLA, and supporting &quot;Oasis Housing&quot; which 
      provides housing as a first step after getting out of shelters or other 
      transitional housing programs. We also honor the &quot;Senior Citizens of Oak 
      Cliff&quot; recognition to a leader who has made a significant contribution to 
      making Oak Cliff a better community.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The award has been 
      given to Judge Fite, Charles Fugua, Joe Denton, Don Hicks, Dr. Charles 
      Tandy, Clifton Rogers, Alan Griswald, William H. Roberts and Bill Durrett. 
      The club also has given recognition to outstanding high school students, 
      police officers and firemen. Like all Rotary Clubs every year is filled 
      with service projects such as these.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Oak Cliff Rotary has a 
      history of supporting education. For years, the club has given annual 
      scholarships to deserving college students. The club has had numerous 
      students as guests, including our RYLA participants, and annually has a 
      &quot;Four Way Test&quot; contest. For years we had a mentoring program for high 
      school students to learn more about possible careers. The club has had 
      numerous school principals and college presidents as members. Many 
      prominent leaders in the Dallas education system have been members of Oak 
      Cliff Rotary. School principals such as William (Bill) Durrett, Harold 
      Filgo, Bob Durrett, Karen Eggers and College Presidents such as Cliff 
      Harris (Dallas Baptist Univ.) Bill Jordan (Mountainview Univ.) and Gary 
      Cook (Dallas Baptist Univ.) have been members of our club while serving in 
      these positions.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Club membership has 
      ranged from 70 + members to 22 members. During the early years it was easy 
      to acquire new members and grow to over 70 members. Throughout most of its 
      history the club has had thirty to fifty members. Like many service clubs, 
      the club has struggled to keep up the number of members in recent years, 
      due to the changes in the Oak Cliff community.</font></p>

      <span class="auto-style2">Chartered May 21, 1948</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Over the years, the 
      Rotary Club of Park Cities has engaged in a wide variety of service 
      projects. Among those projects, however, there has been a decided emphasis 
      on education in all four of its avenues of serviceClub, community, 
      vocational, and international. This report will focus on some of those 
      educational programs. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In the area of 
      Community Service, for example, the Literacy Committee was formed in 1991 
      to raise funds through the sale of citrus fruit during the Christmas 
      season. The first benefactor of the $1,042.84 profit from citrus sales was 
      the Dallas County Adult Literacy Committee which coordinated the efforts 
      of organizations actively engaged in teaching reading and writing. Other 
      beneficiaries are Literary Instruction for Texas (LIFT) and North Dallas 
      Shared Ministries. In eleven years more than $16,000 has been contributed 
      to literacy organizations in Dallas County. This committee also 
      facilitates the work of a large cadre of regular tutors at Stephen C. 
      Foster Elementary School in the Dallas Independent School District (DISD). 
      Finally, we have a program called Diploma Plus in which we subsidize 10 or 
      12 students per year at $50 per month as long as they maintain 
      satisfactory grades, attendance, and citizenship, as determined by the 
      school. In the four years of the program's existence, we are batting 
      1,000, i.e., every student in the program has graduated at the end of his 
      or her senior year.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In the area of 
      Vocational Service, Woodrow Wilson High School (DISD) was selected by the 
      Adopt-a-School Committee to help 100 at-risk 9th grade students achieve 
      the level of grades and attendance of the rest of their classmates. In 
      2001-2002, the Rotary Club of Park Cities provided five motivational 
      speakers each six weeks for Award Assemblies, recognition lunches at our 
      Club meetings for the A &amp; B Honor Role Students, a Career Day in November 
      and a Job Shadow Day in February. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In the area of Club 
      Service, our Public Relations Committee sponsored a contest in the art 
      department of the Hamilton Park Pacesetter Magnet School in which students 
      were asked to design a holiday card. On the back of each card was the 
      Rotary logo and this year's Rotary theme, Mankind Is Our Business. Prizes 
      were awarded to the top two winners and the cards were printed for sale. 
      The project was so well received, student participation was so high, and 
      sales went so well that District 5810 is seriously considering adopting it 
      for district-wide participation. Although we do not consider this project 
      a fund raiser, a check for more than $2,000 profit from the sale of the 
      cards and artwork was presented to the school's principal by the Mayor of 
      Dallas at our February 15, 2002 club meeting.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In the area of 
      International Service, we have sponsored an International Youth Exchange 
      student from France this year. He attended Highland Park High School and 
      made a monthly report to the club on his activities and progress. We also 
      provided the funds to allow him to participate in a culminating trip 
      around the Southwest with the rest of his foreign student friends. We are 
      currently working on the sponsorship of an Ambassadorial Scholar for this 
      year, as we have done in years past.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Rotary Club of 
      Park Cities Frank Monroe Foundation has made substantial monetary grants 
      for educational programs over the past few years to the following 
      educational organizations: The Winston School, Sudie L. Williams 
      Elementary School (DISD), Woodrow Wilson High School (DISD), Open Door 
      Multilingual School, Books 1-2-3 and Earning By Learning and Basic

      <span class="auto-style2">Chartered May 21, 1945</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Plano Rotary Club 
      was chartered on May 21, 1945. Sponsored by the Richardson Rotary Club, a 
      group of business and professional men came together and established a 
      unit of the worldwide service organization in Plano and the Plano Rotary 
      Club began. Twenty one business leaders were present at the Charter 
      Presentation Banquet that was held on June 21, 1945. Among the occupations 
      represented by these members were a furniture store owner, funeral 
      director, hardware store owner, service station owner, insurance agent, 
      cleaning and pressing, grocery store, farm implement dealer, attorney, 
      newspaper publisher, minister, superintendent of schools, automobile 
      dealer, and family doctor. This was a real cross section of the business 
      and professional interests and activities in the community at the time and 
      the Plano Rotary Club has endeavored to maintain this representation 
      through the years. The first president of the club was the funeral 
      director, J. O. &quot;Jack&quot; Harrington. The first club meetings were held in 
      the Methodist Church. Various community rooms, the community house, a 
      local restaurant and now the Harvey Hotel have been home for the luncheon 
      meetings each Thursday.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club has grown 
      steadily over the years to a membership of 135 in 2002 and has provided 
      major leadership for the city. Many mayors, city council members, school 
      superintendents, school trustees and many other key executives have been 
      members of the club. The club is also proud of its two district governors; 
      they are Nathan White (1979-1980) and Herb Hoxie (1996-1997). A strong 
      emphasis of the club has always been perfect attendance. We have prided 
      ourselves on being known as the 100 percent club and stress the importance 
      of making up a missed meeting to all new members.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Charitable donations, 
      service projects and fellowship have always been part of the club's 
      activities. In the late 1940's and 1950's, an annual Halloween Carnival 
      was held in downtown Plano to entertain the kids and keep them out of 
      mischief. Another annual event was the Chili Supper, held on a Friday 
      night before the Plano Wildcats football game. Members served home cooked 
      chili that had simmered all day long. Then the annual Rotary Fish Fry 
      raised funds for nonprofit organizations in our community and most 
      recently the Plano Rotary Roundup has emerged as a most successful 
      fundraiser. All of these events have fostered fellowship and friendships 
      as members worked together for the good of the community. In 1945, the new 
      Rotary Club of Plano had the same general objective as all other Rotary 
      Clubs throughout the world - to encourage and foster the Ideal of Service. 
      This is still true and today you can see this exemplified in the Plano 
      Children's Medical Clinic.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In 1991, the club 
      donated $10,000 to help start the Plano Children's Medical Clinic, a 
      clinic for under privileged children in need of medical care. Ten years 
      later, when a fire destroyed the home of the clinic, the Plano Rotary Club 
      provided the leadership and raised over $100,000 for the clinic's new 
      home. Additionally, members donated services and supplies to make the new 
      clinic a reality. The other Rotary clubs in Plano came together for the 
      first time in a joint effort to support the new clinic. Today, a large 
      Rotary wheel is seen on the front of the clinic. This is a sign of the 
      impact the Plano Rotary Club has had in the Plano community for almost 57

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Gleneagles Country 
      Club is the current home of Plano Metro Rotary. The first six months of 
      our existence, club meetings were held at Tino's Mexican Restaurant in 
      Collin Creek Mall. The restaurant's owner and one of our founding 
      sponsors, Tino Trujillo, made his restaurant available to the club for 
      those first meetings. Two interim moves were made. The first move was to 
      Jamani's Restaurant for about one year. Following Jamani's, the club met 
      at Willow Bend Polo &amp; Hunt Club for less than six months. The club has 
      been at Gleneagles ever since. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Members that have 
      served the club as President include: Ray Wheless, Bob Swepston, J.C. 
      Posey, Ken Chitwood, Ed Jones, Jerry Fleming, Bill Langley, Robert Jansson, 
      Milt Driver, Lewis Brooks, Jeff Chase, Mano Mahadeva, Linda Denton, 
      Geoffrey Glidden, Dan Cheek, Chris Jones and Steve Young (current 
      President). Plano Metro Rotary Club was the first club in Plano to have a 
      woman Rotarian on the roster. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club's primary 
      fundraiser has been a Las Vegas style casino event. It was an event that 
      was inherited from Plano West Rotary. Several locations were tested for 
      the fundraiser. St. Elizabeth Seton's was home to the first two or three, 
      followed by one at Larry Lang Jaguar. South Fork Ranch was the next 
      location. The casual and spacious atmosphere created at South Fork Ranch 
      proved to be a favorite among patrons and the event remained there for 
      many years. However, as overhead escalated at South Fork, the club sought 
      another location. It seemed a perfect fit that Gleneagles Country Club 
      should be the home for our major fundraiser. By 2002, the necessary 
      adjustments were made to revamp the event to better fit the Gleneagles 
      environment. Through the hard work and effort of club volunteers, their 
      spouses and generous business leaders, the event is an enormous success.

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Plano Metro Rotarians 
      have historically had a bias toward supporting programs that serve youth 
      both locally and internationally. Some of the recipients of our club's 
      contributions have included: PISD Help the Kids Program, Camp RYLA, the 
      Hendrick Foundation, Student Venture, Polio Plus, Boy and Girls Club of 
      Collin County, the YMCA, Samaritan Inn, Mary Crowley Academic and 
      Vocational Scholarship Program and the Tahuichi Soccer organization for 
      Bolivian children. However, other groups have benefited from the club's 
      generosity including: the Wylie Tornado Relief Fund, Mission Honduras, 
      Phoenix Ministry, Muscular Dystrophy Association, the Food Pantry and 
      P.U.S.H., to name a few. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&quot;Service Above Self&quot; 
      has been demonstrated time and again. Members have volunteered for 
      neighborhood house painting projects, lawn clean-up and painting at CITY 
      House, the Citizen of the Month program at Hedgecoxe Elementary, 
      delivering Meals on Wheels to local senior citizens, and assisting Plano 
      Rotary Club with Rotary Round-up to benefit the Children's Medical Clinic. 
      We have sponsored a Rotary Foundation Ambassadorial Scholar and opened our 
      homes to International Exchange Students and member's of RI's Group Study 
      Exchange. </font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In November 1999, four 
      former Plano Rotarians (Gary Basham, Terry Dobbins, John Findley, and T.L. 
      Morgan) and one current Plano Rotarian Tino Trujillo, began talking 
      informally about starting a fourth Rotary Club in Plano </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The first 
      organizational meeting was held at 11:30 am, December 1, 1999, at Tino's 
      in Collin Creek Mall followed by another such meeting on December 17, 
      1999. The Plano Rotary Club agreed to sponsor the new club; Tino Trujillo 
      was appointed Governor's Rep and approval was sought from the other two 
      clubs in town. Communication would be by email. The Bulletins would be 
      published on the web and not printed and mailed. Club Service projects 
      would be done with &quot;Sweat Equity&quot; and not by fund raising. Emphasis will 
      be placed on attendance with the target to be 100% every week. There will 
      be no head table. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The first meeting of 
      the provisional Plano Rotary Club was held on January 7, 2000 at Tino's in 
      the Mall at 7:00 am. During January the name was changed from Plano Early 
      to Plano Sunrise and the time was fixed at 7:00 AM; the location moved to 
      Tino's Too on the East Side and charter application was made with 32 
      members, 11 who were former Plano Rotarians and 5 who were members of the 
      parent club. The club received its charter February 23, 2000.</font></p>

      Terry Dobbins, President; Mike Booher, President-Elect; Secretary, Sharon 
      Lewis; Treasurer, Doug Ray, and Sgt.-at-Arms, Michael Dobbins. The Charter 
      Officers agreed to serve the rest of the year plus the full Rotary year of 
      2001-2002.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Sweat Equity Projects 
      have included: scraping and painting a house, helping Plano Habitat for 
      Humanity build a house, adopting a neighborhood in East Plano and helping 
      clean it up by weed eating alleys, picking up trash, painting house 
      numbers on curbs and in alleys, providing manpower to Plano Rotary for the 
      Rotary Roundup fund raiser for Plano Children's Medical Center, mentoring 
      elementary students in reading and numerous small bits. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Membership continues 
      to grow from the original 32 and on our second birthday stood at 47. In 
      our first two years, only ONE person has missed and failed to make-up. He 
      has custody of a pot-bellied pig named Penelope and will pass it on to the 
      next person who misses and doesn't make up.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Plano West Rotary was 
      the second Rotary club established in Plano, Texas. We have a diverse 
      membership of business owners, community leaders, and business executives 
      in our club. Plano West Rotary has been committed to the ideals of 
      &quot;Service Above Self&quot;. We have tried numerous fundraisers over the years, 
      looking for one with the best overall success. Most of our fundraisers 
      have been very successful. However, there was one fundraiser that almost 
      caused our club to close. That was a fundraiser called &quot;Rock On&quot;, it was 
      an outdoor concert held at Clark Stadium in Plano. There were several big 
      name bands that played at the event. Many factors contributed to the 
      concert losing money, lots of money! However, our club members rallied 
      around each other and we managed to survive. Currently our main 
      fundraisers are:</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Plano Balloon 
      Festival- We sell Funnel cakes and soft drinks. Proceeds go to general 
      fund for distribution.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Pecans-We sell 1 lb. 
      bags of pecans starting in mid October through Thanksgiving. Funds 
      generated are used for scholarships to the 3 Plano high schools.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Glow Necklaces-We sell 
      glow necklaces at the July 4th event held in Plano. We split profits 
      between Boy Scout Troop 25 and Plano west Rotary. Proceeds are used for 
      Vocational Scholarships at Plano high schools.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">We became involved in 
      a very worthy International Project in 2001 called &quot;The Lost Boys of 
      Sudan&quot;. These young men were displaced from their homes in the area of 
      Sudan in Africa due to &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; between rival tribes. Most of 
      these young men's parents and entire families were killed and they had no 
      place to go. They were eventually re-located into a temporary camp. 
      Through the United States government a program was established to help 
      these young men relocate to America. Many of these young men reside in the 
      Dallas area. Plano West Rotary has donated numerous amounts of time and 
      essential living items to help them adjust to living in America.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Plano West Rotary has 
      supported numerous charity and non-profit organizations over the years 
      including a $25,000 donation to help rebuild the Plano Children's Medical 
      Clinic; all Rotary clubs in Plano, plus the Richardson Central club 
      supported this project. We have supported many International and District 
      5810 projects. We have also supported the following programs locally: Meal 
      On Wheels, Plano Senior Citizens Center, Boy Scout Troop 25, Boy Scouts 
      Circle 10 Council, Plano Food Pantry and Habitat For Humanity.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">We are proud of the

      in the district, it maintains one of the most active programs of community 
      service and actively pursues the motto, &quot;Service Above Self&quot;</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Preston Center 
      Rotary Club (PCRC) was chartered on December 31, 1985, with 28 members. 
      From its inception our club has focused on the needs of children. RI had 
      just committed to Polio Plus and requested that each Rotarian contribute 
      $100 to meet its goal of eradicating polio. Knowing we had to meet this 
      goal before moving on to other projects, PCRC raised the funds, and was 
      recognized at the 1986 District Conference in San Antonio as one of the 
      top five contributing clubs in the 25 to 30 member class.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Our next two projects 
      included &quot;Adopt-a-School,&quot; which involved mentoring students from North 
      Dallas High School and &quot;I Have a Dream &quot; which involved mentoring 6th 
      graders to stay in school with the incentive that there would be monies 
      available to them for college. In this last program we made a six-year 
      commitment to mentor fifty kids from two elementary school classes and to 
      contribute $36,000 in scholarship dollars for these students. We were 
      assisted by the Larry Lightner Foundation, which partnered with us and 
      contributed another $14,000 to cover the total commitment of $50,000.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">At the time our 
      commitment to &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; was winding down we met with Kathy Dudley, 
      founder of Voice of Hope, a student-centered non-profit agency established 
      in West Dallas, one of the metroplex's poorest communities. The heart of 
      the program was to focus on kids early in their lives by providing 
      academic and emotional support, a sense of balance and belonging, to 
      insure that these at-risk children were not lost to other environmental 
      pressures. Partnering with parents, good habits and learning skills were 
      established. One of the first community-wide projects was called &quot;West 
      Dallas Clean&quot; where approximately 250 volunteers met to walk the 
      neighborhood and pick up trash in West Dallas. The idea was to do 
      something that would give the residents pride and get the city's 
      attention. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Our involvement with 
      Voice of Hope led to a fun annual fundraiser known as the &quot;Rotary Grand 
      Prix&quot; go-cart race where competition is encouraged among children, 
      parents, Rotarians and businesses. Each team consists of five members so 
      teamwork is essential. The Grand Prize is the Governor's Cup, which can be 
      displayed and then returned for the next year's race. The proceeds of this 
      unique event (which started at $5,000 and now in its 10th year approach 
      $150,000) support the Voice of Hope's summer camp. PCRC has worked with 
      this organization for sixteen years and we have seen it grow from a soccer 
      ball and a Bible to an organization that has its own building, a full time 
      staff and now impacts the entire family. Our greatest satisfaction comes 
      from the fact that some of the children we have worked with have now come 
      back as adults taking active roles in its leadership.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Moving to the far 
      northeast portion of the metroplex, we find Equest, the benefactor of our 
      second annual charity fundraiser. Equest promotes therapeutic horseback 
      riding as part of a total neuromuscular program to help children who have 
      injuries or disabilities too difficult for conventional therapies to 
      treat.. Surprisingly, physical and motivational benefits are common in 
      this program. Physical therapists come from as far away as Europe to train 
      at Equest, which now trains instructors for the expansion of these 
      techniques across the country as well as throughout the world. Our 
      Westapher golf tournament has been the major fundraising event that 
      enables PCRC to successfully support this organization.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Our involvement with 
      children extends beyond our own borders. For example, PCRC has sponsored 
      Rotary Exchange Students from Japan, Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil over 
      the last ten consecutive years. In addition, with our Sister Club The 
      Juarez Rotary Club in Cuernavaca, Mexico, we participated in a Matching 
      Grant designed to assist that local club in helping their disadvantaged 
      youth.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Out of this 
      experience, we successfully completed an unusual reverse matching grant. 
      It is unusual for several reasons. First, it appeared to have three 
      dimensions, as it bridged Community Service with International Service and 
      then took on a Club Service aspect. The community aspect is that Mi 
      Escuelita's goal is literacy, one of Rotary International's mandates. We 
      took a constructive action to help a vital community project grow. 
      Secondly, the international aspect is that our sister club in Cuernavaca, 
      Mexico took the initiative to apply for a matching grant, which provided 
      resource libraries for Mi Escuelita's five locations. We matched their 
      funds, applied to District 5810 for a contribution, and then Rotary 
      International matched the total. It is considered reverse from the fact 
      that money came back to the USA. Thirdly, Club Service was brought into 
      play by raising the awareness of our membership to the literacy deficiency 
      and needs of our community. Mi Escuelita is located to the north of, and 
      adjacent to, downtown Dallas and targets pre-school children by teaching 
      them to read and speak in English. These children are in the lowest 10 
      percent of reading readiness and come from homes where English is rarely 
      spoken. Originally established for the Hispanic population, it has since 
      expanded to include Asians. They now teach 330 students annually and its 
      success can be measured from the 80+% high school graduation rate.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Rotarians of our club 
      are encouraged to actively participate in the organizations we support. 
      Volunteering as mentors, readers, teachers and board members, we as 
      members of PCRC are further able to invest in the needs of our community. 
      Writing a check does not generate the satisfaction that getting involved 
      in the operations does. Seeing the joy on someone's face for an effort 
      made far outweighs any recognition or reward that can be received.</font></p>

      line, West to Inwood Road, and East to Coit Road. In 1984, the Club 
      determined that a second Rotary Club was needed in the territory; this 
      second club was designated the Addison Rotary Club and at that time, 
      Addison-Prestonwood officially became the Prestonwood Rotary Club.

      </p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Club originally 
      met at the Spring Valley Country Club. Subsequently, Prestonwood moved to 
      the Marriott Quorum, and later to the Prestonwood Country Club, where it 
      currently meets on Wednesday from noon to 1:15 PM. Excellent location, an 
      outstanding buffet, a wide variety of programs, under the guidance of Past 
      President Mike Kelly. Genuine friendship and fellowship have resulted in 
      Prestonwood's recognition as one of the best clubs in District 5810.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In documenting our 
      history, special mention must be made of Max Wells, PDG Austin Watson and 
      PDG Doyle McKinney and his wife, Faye. Wells, a former member of the 
      Dallas City Council, was instrumental in establishing the infrastructure 
      of the Club. PDGs Watson and McKinney have been invaluable as friends and 
      mentors of Prestonwood since its inception.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Prestonwood has a 
      history of outstanding officers and directors and was the first club in 
      the District to appoint a Parliamentarian. Past President Bud Wahl, now an 
      honorary member living in Arizona, was the first to hold that position.
      </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">We have always 
      embraced Rotary's Four Avenues of Service:</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Prestonwood has 
      maintained a 90% or better monthly attendance rate for the past 22 years. 
      The Club established a Past Presidents' Committee, which serves at the 
      pleasure of the President. These members chair attendance, membership 
      development, new member orientation, and the Rotary Foundation, as well as 
      mentoring for new members.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Prestonwood 
      participates in a broad spectrum of vocational service programs. These 
      include Camp RYLA, The 4-Way Test Speech Contest, off-site meetings and 
      vocational service talks. Prestonwood's unique contribution is Law 
      Enforcement Appreciation Day (LEAD) and honors several unsung officers of 
      the Dallas Police Department annually.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">We are actively 
      involved in four significant community service projects:</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Challenge Air For Kids 
      and Friends, begun in 1993 by a late member of our club, Rick Amber, has 
      the goal of showing physically challenged children that they can &quot;Reach 
      for the Sky&quot; and be successful. Over 11,000 youngsters have been flown 
      here and throughout the United States.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Gilda's Club provides 
      a non-residential, homelike meeting place where people with cancer, their 
      families and friends, can join with others to build emotional and social 
      support. Prestonwood began its involvement in 2001 with a golf tournament. 
      Second annual event is scheduled for June, 2002.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Share the Blessing, an 
      annual project that involves donating food, toys and financial aid to less 
      fortunate persons in the community is now in its 4th year.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Amelia Earhart 
      Learning Center, an inner-city school in West Dallas, benefits from 
      Prestonwood's active involvement for more than two decades. The Club 
      provides students with supplies, materials, Weekly Reader and Scholastic 
      magazines, and funds to insure that the 6th graders take their annual 
      flight to NASA in Houston.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Prestonwood also 
      sponsors an annual Community Service Awards Day, where worthy citizens ae 
      recognized for their outstanding contributions to the Metroplex.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Prestonwood is highly 
      committed to International Service by its involvement in Youth Exchange, 
      Mini-Exchange, Group Study Exchange, and Ambassadorial Scholarships. We 
      have acquired matching grants that have assisted us with Sister Clubs in 
      South Africa, Siberia and Australia</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Rotary Foundation: 
      Because of the guidance of Past President Harry Sebel, the Prestonwood 
      Club has 100% participation of its members - either as Paul Harris Fellows 
      or Sustaining members. Over $100,000 has been contributed in our 25 years.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Prestonwood Rotary 
      will celebrate its 25th Anniversary in 2002. The theme of this event is 
      &quot;SILVER yesterdays will become GOLDEN tomorrows.&quot; When people ask what 
      Prestonwood Rotary is all about, the Club responds, &quot; We are a Rotary 
      family and we do good things.&quot;</font></p>

      <span class="auto-style2">Chartered September 14, 1938</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Richardson Rotary 
      Club has a proud history dating back to 1938. That is when its first 
      President, Clifford Huffman was installed by the Garland Rotary Club.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">One of the priority 
      areas of service for the club has been the field of education. Over the 
      years, the Superintendents of Education for the Richardson Independent 
      School District have been members of the club, including J. J. Pearce, 
      among others. This dedication to educating young people resulted in the 
      formation of the Richardson Rotary Club Foundation. The Foundation 
      provides four-year college scholarships to deserving graduates of 
      Richardson schools. Fund raising efforts over the years have included 
      raffles and the sale of holiday items as well as donations by members. The 
      Foundation now has endowments for two new scholarships each year. The Club 
      continues to build on this legacy.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Members are also 
      actively engaged with students at Dobie Primary School. Dobie is a local 
      school that includes only pre-kindergarten through first grade. Several 
      members regularly serve as tutors at the school. There are a number of 
      languages spoken in the homes of these children as their families come 
      from all over the world. Most have very limited financial resources. Each 
      fall, the Club purchases school supplies for the children. These are 
      brought, in bulk, to the club meeting, where all the members and guests 
      that day participate in preparing a bundle for each child. Last year, a 
      local vendor donated book bags so children could more easily take items to 
      and from school; in addition, each holiday season the Club purchases gifts 
      for them. The school staff organizes gift packages appropriate for each 
      child. The gifts are then distributed to their parents. Sometimes, this is 
      the only gift a child has received at the holidays. We think it's 
      important that they know we care.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">One of the most 
      successful international projects involved sending medical equipment to 
      Turkey. One of our members had visited a club in Turkey during a vacation 
      trip. Very large earthquakes had struck there during the trip. Some of the 
      injuries sustained by victims required kidney dialysis treatment. We were 
      contacted by the Turkish club and asked if we could help. One of our 
      members arranged to have 10 machines donated by a U. S. manufacturer. A 
      local business firm donated funds to build crates for the machines. We 
      also sought guidance from the Turkish Counsel's office and were able to 
      arrange free shipping on Turkish Airlines while the Turkish Red Crescent 
      organization agreed to serve as importers and distributors of the machines 
      to facilities in need. We also raised funds locally and obtained a 
      matching grant in partnership with the Turkish Club through the Rotary 
      Foundation. These funds were used to purchase supplies to operate the 
      dialysis machines.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Richardson Rotary 
      Club and its members are actively engaged in helping make our community a 
      better place in which to live, and to help improve social and economic 
      conditions throughout the world. </font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Discussion went on for 
      several years at the Richardson Rotary Club about the need for a second 
      club in Richardson to allow more community leaders the opportunity to join 
      Rotary and also have a place locally to do &quot;make-ups&quot;. Thus, Richardson 
      Central Rotary Club was started by Tom Price in 1980 with Harry Scott 
      serving as the first President. The provisional club of 24 Charter members 
      elected officers on February 22, and started meeting on February 29 at 
      Wyatt's Cafeteria. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The official Rotary 
      International Charter (dated March 21) was presented April 11 at the 
      District Conference banquet at the Dallas Twin Sixties Inn, with District 
      Governor Nathan White, Jr., presiding. The official club logo designed by 
      Jim Rogers was unanimously adopted by the board on August 26. The first 
      annual installation banquet chaired by Wayne Mayo was held June 5, 1981 at 
      the Canyon Creek Country Club. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The motto of 
      Richardson's second Rotary Club is &quot;Service is Central&quot; and from the 
      beginning the members have enjoyed &quot;hands on&quot; service projects, from 
      mentoring children at a low income elementary school to working security 
      at the Richardson Holiday Parade, to hosting an annual swim party/picnic 
      for the Boys and Girls Club of Richardson. The club has also given 
      financial support to many organizations and projects such as Richardson 
      YMCA; Circle Ten Council of Boy Scouts; Network of Community Ministries; 
      New York Relief; Plano Children's Medical Center; Richardson Development 
      Center for Children; Richardson DeMolay Chapter; Challenge Air for Kids; 
      Richardson Fire Department; and college scholarships for vocational 
      students. The Central club works well with the other Richardson clubs 
      hosting the Annual Business and Industry Lunch for the Chamber of 
      Commerce. To finance these projects for years the major fund-raiser was a 
      dinner/silent and live auction, but for the last four years the club has 
      sustained its charitable giving through a car raffle (2 VW Bugs, a PT 
      Cruiser, and this year a Jeep Liberty.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Realizing the &quot;Service 
      above Self&quot; potential of the female gender, Richardson Central was quick 
      to accept women into Rotary, having had four women presidents since 1994. 
      Other outstanding Central Rotarians include Jaye Marksbury, &quot;Mr. Rotary&quot;, 
      who served District 5810 in multi-capacities simultaneously, as well as 
      literally dedicating his life to Richardson Central Rotary and its 
      success. Wayne Mayo, another standout, is a Charter Member, Past 
      President, past member of District committees, and still chairs and serves 
      on various club committees and &quot;he ain't even retired yet!&quot; 
		</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In its short history, 
      Richardson Central has been very active at the District level, with its 
      members serving as Assistant Governors, Communication Chair, Four Way Test 
      Speech Chair, District Treasurer, GSE Chair, Annual Giving Chair and 
      numerous other positions and committees. At the International level the 
      Central club has sent several Ambassadorial scholars overseas as well as 
      participating in the Teacher Exchange program, GSE Team Leader , 
      International Youth Exchange and Matching Grants. Each year the club 
      finances its President's trip to the Rotary International Convention.
      </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Richardson Central is 
      proud of its support of the Rotary Foundation over the years, which 
      includes 67 Paul Harris Fellows, 33 Benefactors, 18 Paul Harris Sustaining 
      Members and one Major Donor. Central is also proud of receiving the Rotary 
      International Presidential Citation consistently since the beginning of 
      the program.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">IN MEMORIAM</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">On Friday, February 
      23, 2001, Jaye Marksbury, who at the time was serving as President of 
      Richardson Central Rotary Club, passed away. During that day, he had 
      presided at the club meeting. Excerpts from a memorial written by Mary 
      Rydesky, Mesquite Rotary, follow:</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&quot;Jaye was a most 
      articulate man and a keen observer of the human condition. Like Master's 
      writing in Spoon River Anthology, Jaye's words could capture the essence 
      of the moment - or a person - in precise and detailed discussion. His way 
      made for a flowing, conversational story telling, for he knew when the 
      chapter was ended, and that turned his attention to listening. 
		</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">He was bright, 
      impassioned, well-spoken and selfless. Feisty and impatient, he was as 
      constant as the North Star when it came to his word and his devotion to 
      Rotary. His legacy is a standard; he showed us how to look beyond the 
      detractions as we remain focused on &quot;Service Above Self&quot;.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Jaye was a working 
      Rotarian. Everything he did centered on Rotary, it seemed. He was working 
      on fund-raising ideas, community service initiatives and plans for the 
      next round of District communications talks. Did he ever miss a District 
      event? Was he ever unprepared for his Club's meetings, where he presided 
      each week? His actions challenge us to be as constant in service and 
      commitment&quot;. </font></p>

      <span class="auto-style2">Chartered August 22, 1985</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">On September 17, 1985, 
      District Governor Collie called club President Volney Shields to 
      congratulate him on the approved charter for the Richardson East Rotary 
      Club. The approval of 24 charter members closed on August 22, 1985. In 
      March 2002, five charter members are still in the club. One of the charter 
      members, Clifford Huffhines, was also a charter member of the Richardson 
      club, 1938, and it's first President. The Richardson East Rotary Club also 
      owes a debt of gratitude to Gene Parrish of the Richardson Central Rotary 
      Club for his support in the charter process.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">From the very first 
      meeting, the club has been a very tight knit group. The size of the club 
      has consistently ranged around 30 to 35 members. That has been considered 
      an excellent size for all club socials and the ability to meet in various 
      members homes. The club has a wonderful casual spirit and a balance of 
      ages and genders. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The various avenues of 
      service have been well served over the years. A balanced approach has been 
      taken to see that each avenue, each year, has meaningful projects. 
      Community Service projects that are undertaken by the club include Camp 
      Enterprise, Camp RYLA, Leadership Richardson, Network, Santa's Village and 
      scholarships. International Service projects include disaster relief, 
      group study exchange, international convention, polio plus and Paul Harris 
      sustaining members. Vocational Service projects include Forestridge 
      Elementary, Stults Road Elementary, Four-Way Test speech contest and 
      teacher appreciation. Club Service projects include several socials during 
      the year. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">At the 2002 District 
      Assembly the Richardson East club had the highest number of participants.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Looking back over the 
      years two projects stand out reflecting what most people equate with 
      Rotary. The first is the Leadership Grove project. The idea of this 
      project is to provide a vehicle in the community to honor and say &quot;thanks&quot; 
      to those individuals that have played a leadership role in the lives of 
      various individuals or groups. There have been a wide range of individuals 
      honored which range from parents, teachers and civic leaders. Trees were 
      purchased by those wishing to honor someone and planted on the civic 
      center grounds followed by a presentation ceremony. It is an opportunity 
      to honor an individual, beautify the city and provide working funds for 
      other Rotary projects. It has truly been a win-win situation for all 
      concerned.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The second is the 
      Casino Night project. This is the large fund raising project for the club 
      that provides large dollars for the various benevolent endeavors of the 
      club. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Richardson East 
      Rotary Club is now looking to the future by planning for bigger and more 
      urgent community projects and invites everyone wishing to make a 
      contribution to come join in the fun and opportunity for service.</font></p>

      <span class="auto-style2">Chartered March 15, 1939</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Rockwall Rotary 
      Club is the oldest service club in Rockwall County. In March of 1939, 25 
      prospective members met at the Mecca Cafe in Rockwall with District 
      Governor Hubert Johnson of Waco to organize the Rockwall Rotary Club. 
      Forest Stephenson was elected charter President and served again as 
      President during the club's 25th anniversary year. Among the charter 
      members in 1939 was former Dallas District Attorney, Henry Wade.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">On December 21, 1945, 
      the six year old, 20 member Rotary Club bought its own building in 
      downtown Rockwall for $300.00. The building had a crumbling floor, no 
      kitchen and no water. The building was located next door to Ben Klutts' 
      tractor dealership. Ben became a member of the club in the summer of 1939 
      and provided water to the building by connecting a water hose to a faucet 
      and dragging the hose to Rotary Hall. After a few years, water and sewer 
      services were extended to the building. However, it was the mid-1979's 
      before a rest room was added.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Boy Scout troop 319 
      was chartered in 1939 under the sponsorship of the club. In fact, the 
      troop was granted its charter while the Rockwall club was still in 
      provisional status and had not yet received its charter from Rotary 
      International. This association represents the longest continuous 
      sponsorship of a troop in the district.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club outgrew 
      Rotary Hall and had to cap its membership at 70 members. On October 18, 
      1988, the club approved the formation of a breakfast club. The Rockwall 
      Breakfast Rotary Club's charter was granted on March 15, 1989, exactly 50 
      years from the day the Rockwall Rotary Club was granted its charter.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Congressman Ralph Hall 
      served as 1953-1954 President and is an honorary member of the club. On 
      February 11, 1988, the club inducted its first female member, Jane Bounds. 
      Jane was the owner and publisher of the town's newspaper, The Rockwall 
      Success, and she is still an active member of the club. July 1, 1998 Cindy 
      Tayem became the club's first female president. On July 1, 2002, Betty 
      Fulmer will be installed as the second female president.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In July, 1996, the 
      club established the Rockwall Rotary Foundation. Later that year, the 
      Foundation purchased and renovated a 2,500 square foot building that 
      became the new Rotary Hall. Unlike the original Rotary Hall, this building 
      has a commercial kitchen, running water and two rest rooms. As a community 
      service, the Foundation leases the building to individuals and 
      organizations in the Rockwall area at below market rates. In addition to 
      use by the community, the building is home to the Rockwall Rotary Club and 
      Rockwall Breakfast Club.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club's primary 
      fund-raising event is the Rockwall Rotary Hot Rocks Bike Ride. The ride 
      was initiated by Rotarian Stan Lowrance and attracts approximately 1,200 
      riders annually. The proceeds from the ride provide funds to maintain four 
      ongoing college scholarships awarded to high school graduates of the 
      Rockwall Independent School District.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club's other 
      annual fund-raiser is the Taste of Rockwall. It is held in conjunction 
      with the Rockwall Chamber of Commerce Business Expo. The event attracts 
      approximately 800 people to sample food from Rockwall area restaurants and 
      visit display booths of Rockwall area businesses.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Over the years, the 
      club has been actively involved in meeting community needs and supporting 
      the programs of Rotary International. Due to the success of the club's 
      programs and its involvement in the Rockwall area, the club has grown to 
      100 members. Unfortunately, the club will soon have to cap its membership 
      again because of space limitations. However, we know from experience that 
      limited membership causes people to appreciate even more the privilege of 
      belonging to the Rockwall Rotary Club.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Formation of the 
      Rockwall Rotary Breakfast Club was accomplished following many months of 
      extensive research, study, discussion and deliberation, beginning during 
      the 1988 presidency of Kent Smith. Initial contact with the Rotary 
      District 581 Extension Committee was made at that time.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">When the 50th 
      Anniversary Committee was established in March 1988, formation of a 
      breakfast club as part of the 60th celebration was discussed. From the 
      first meeting on October 17, 1988, the committee unanimously approved a 
      breakfast club as a 50th Anniversary project. On the following day, in a 
      special meeting the Rockwall Rotary Club Board of Directors unanimously 
      approved the creation of a Rockwall Rotary Breakfast Club, subject to 
      approval by the existing Club's membership and the District Governor.

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">District Governor 
      Vactor Stanford gave his enthusiastic approval, appointing Gerald Burgemy 
      as his representative to the provisional club.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Jack Horn was 
      appointed Rockwall Rotary Club's representative to the group. President 
      Gary Johnson, President-Elect Larry Parks and 50th Anniversary Chairman 
      Don Stodghill, all of the Rockwall Club, worked closely with the group 
      during the formation of the new club</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Our most successful 
      fund-raisers have been auto raffles of a Beetle Bug and a PT Crusier. 
      These successful fund raisers have enabled us to fund our Teacher 
      Appreciation Awards; College Scholarships for Rockwall graduates; Mike 
      Barringer's used shoes for children in South America; Matching Grant funds 
      for an orphanage, La Casita, in Cancun, Mexico; eye glasses for students 
      in need in Rockwall, The Rainbow Room and financial aid to other local and 
      national and charity organizations.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">We are very proud of 
      the work that Larry Dobbs has done with The RYLA Program and the 
      development of an Interact Club in Rockwall High School.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Rockwall Breakfast has 
      been one of the most active and participating clubs in our Rotary

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Rotary Club of 
      Sherman, Texas began with a meeting at The Miller Boarding House in 
      Sherman on February 17, 1923. The original charter members totaled 20 
      local businessmen. The sponsoring club for Sherman was the Rotary Club of 
      Bonham, Texas. On the day of the first official meeting the official club 
      charter failed to arrive, but the meeting was held anyway. As it turned 
      out loss of the charter was not a first since it was lost once again 
      later. The re-issued charter now hangs in the current president's office. 
      Early projects of Sherman Rotary included mosquito eradication, creation 
      of a local Boy Scout program, betterment of public roads and much, much 
      more. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Sherman Club has 
      had two members serve as district governors, Euclid T. Fant (1956-1957), 
      who mysteriously disappeared in 1958 without a trace, and L.T. White 
      (1986-1987). L.T. remains in the club with 38 years of perfect attendance. 
      One more comment about Euclid...he was dropped from Rotary membership on 
      October 31, 1958 after four missed meetings, unheard of for Euclid. 
      Detectives found his car, Rotary pen, and glasses at the Dallas train 
      station. He was never heard from again. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Our membership has 
      grown from the original 25 to an approximate average of 90 members. Club 
      maximum enrollment hit approximately 112 members in 1976. Our club 
      currently lists over 120 Paul Harris Fellows with ten Benefactors. 
      </font>
      </p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Sherman Club has 
      sponsored the Van Alstyne, now Hurricane Creek Club, and the Grayson Club. 
      In 1986, Rotary International announced the Polio Plus Campaign and asked 
      Sherman to pledge $25,000; however, our board increased the goal to 
      $50,000 which became the club's focus through 1988. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Sherman Club has 
      been active in group study exchange (GSE) both in nominating and having 
      team members accepted; we have supported international youth exchange on 
      many occasions, hosted inbound GSE teams, sponsored an Ambassadorial 
      Scholar Laura Howe to Birmingham, England 2001-2002, and are presently 
      nominating an Austin College student for an Ambassadorial or Rotary World 
      Peace Scholar. We have also sponsored a club member, Jerry Middents, to 
      serve as a RI visiting professor to India on two different occasions. 
      Sherman Rotary has been active in providing GSE outbound team members, as 
      well as having members selected as outbound alternate team chiefs. Other 
      significant projects the club has been instrumental in is the creation of 
      a local Goodwill Industries; sponsorship of a Rotaract Club at Austin 
      College; support of a Drug Free Youth in Texas program at Sherman High 
      School; earthquake support in Central America, and food drives to help 
      local needy. Weekly programs have been outstanding with speakers ranging 
      from Dan Moody, Governor of Texas; US Senators and Congressional 
      Representatives, to include Sam Rayburn, Kay Bailey Hutchison, and Ralph 
      Hall; US Secretary of the Navy; Laura Bush; Nobel Prize winner, Oscar 
      Arias of Costa Rica; and RI President James Lacey.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">One of the success 
      stories that our club is most proud of is that in 1939 the club loaned 
      $100 to a lady named Mary Carter Crowley. Ms.Crowley needed the money to 
      go to business school in Dallas. This involved considerable hardship on 
      her part as a single mother raising two young children. After graduating 
      she went into business for herself using the Rotary Four Way Test for her 
      business plan. A banker agreed with her and loaned her additional money to 
      start her business. On Sherman Rotary's faith and $100 scholarship, Mary's 
      company, Home Interiors and Gifts, Inc. grew to 1,400 employees with an 
      additional 3,700 domestic manufacturers, and an additional 17,500 
      manufacturers overseas. Since Sherman Rotary put $100 in Mary's hands in 
      1939 her company has paid $549,391,000 in taxes through 1997.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Sherman Rotary 
      Club Educational Fund, Inc. was chartered in 1967 to give scholarships 
      instead of loans. The Fund has evolved to The Sherman Rotary Club 
      Charitable and Scholarship Foundation Inc., which provides not only 
      traditional scholarships, but also funding for other worthy projects.

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Sherman Club

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">A formal 75 year

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club began life in 
      1986 as the Rotary Club of Balch Springs. It was formed to bring the 
      Rotary presence to the Southeast Corner of the DFW metroplex. The Balch 
      Springs Club also filled the need for a breakfast club in this area. In 
      1998, we petitioned for a name and territory change. Both were granted and 
      we have been trying to extend our influence ever since.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">It has always been a 
      small club, but one that really believes in Rotary. As one of the smallest 
      and newest clubs, we have endeavored to have an impact that belies our 
      size. Our club has accomplished several noteworthy items.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Our club has been very 
      active in the programs and support of The Rotary Foundation. Southeast 
      Dallas County has led District 5810 in per capita giving to the Rotary 
      Foundation in 1997-1998, 1999-2000, and most recently in the 2001-2002 
      year with an average gift of $496.25 per member. We have sponsored three 
      Ambassadorial Scholarship candidates. We hosted the inbound GSE team from 
      Korea in 1998. We have participated in the Send-a-Book program and have 
      been regular attendees to the Foundation Alumni Banquet. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">We have participated 
      in the Camp RYLA program since its inception. Buddy Cranshaw has been on 
      staff for several years and Pete Snider was a cabin counselor in the 2000 
      and 2001 camps. We have sponsored at least 2 campers each year, with up to 
      four on occasion.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">We have sponsored 
      outbound Rotary Youth Exchange students every year since 1999. Our first 3 
      students spent a year in Liege, Belgium, and our 2002 student will travel 
      to Japan. We are pleased to see the positive impact that Rotary has had on 
      the lives of these young students, and we continue to maintain contact 
      with them.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">We have had small 
      community service projects in the past; one of them was to help finance 
      and construct a new playground for the City of Balch Springs. This 
      playground was, unfortunately, constructed in a park without restrooms and 
      has been furnished with porta-potties for the use of the children. In 
      keeping with the tradition of Rotary's community service, in 2002 we 
      financed and built a new permanent restroom for the park.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">We are proud of our 
      contribution to the leadership of District 5810. Our members have 
      supported all of the District 5810 functions with vigor. Past President, 
      Marge Prosser, was our first District officer, serving as a Governor's 
      representative in 1996-1997. Pete Snider continued the tradition as 
      Governor's representative in 1997-1998 and Assistant District Governor in 
      1998-2000. Pete also served the district as International Service Chair in 
      1999-2000 and Rotary Foundation Chair in 2000-2002. </font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Berry Watts has been 
      on the District Assembly committee and has been in charge of the display 
      tables at Assembly in 2001 and 2002. Past President, Rich McCormick is 
      leading the 2002 GSE team to the Philippines and will do a fine job 
      representing Southeast Dallas County, District 5810 and the USA.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Southeast Dallas 
      Rotary is also proud to &quot;furnish&quot;one of its own, Pete Snider, to serve as 
      District Governor of 5810 for the 2002-2003 Rotary year. </font></p>

      <span class="auto-style2">Chartered December 1, 1920</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Terrell Rotary 
      Club has completed over 80 years of service to its community. While the 
      needs of Terrell have varied over the years, the dedication of the 
      Rotarians to help meet those needs has not.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club was chartered 
      in 1920, under the guidance of the Dallas Rotary Club. That club also 
      officiated at the charter presentation and assisted its first president, 
      Kenneth E. Mason, in the development of its programs. Ernest Vivian King 
      was secretary.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club's involvement 
      with the schools of Terrell has been notable. In the early days of the 
      club, each member acted as the mentor of a high school student. The club 
      also developed a college scholarship fund for high school graduates. 
      Through such projects as selling fruit at Christmas or placing flags on 
      the streets of the city, worthy graduates of both the public and private 
      schools have benefited from the work of Rotarians. They have sponsored 
      students to go annually to Rotary's Youth Leadership Camp (RYLA).</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Each year the Terrell 
      Club conducts a &quot;Four Way Speech Contest&quot;, in conjunction with the 
      District 5810 program, by sponsoring the annual contest for the best talk 
      by high school students, showing how the 4-Way Test can be applied to 
      everyday life. The club has also extended recognition each year to the 
      dedicated teachers in the Terrell public schools.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">At the time of the 
      founding of the Terrell Club, the economy of the city was heavily 
      dependent on agriculture and ranching. It is not surprising to find club 
      projects which supported those areas in the past, but numerous talks and 
      donations to projects demonstrate the continued understanding of the 
      importance of the present. The Club has also cooperated with other civic 
      clubs in numerous projects which benefit the city. The &quot;Toys for Tots&quot; 
      program and the annual program with the volunteers at the State Hospital 
      are just two examples.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club has also 
      produced a club bulletin weekly for over thirty years. This bulletin has 
      kept members informed of Rotary activities at the local, district, 
      national and international levels, while providing members some humor to 
      enliven the meetings.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">One of the earliest 
      members of the club, the Rev. Dan Grieder provided the guidance to the 
      other members as a song leader. The club became known as the &quot;Singing 
      Rotarians&quot;. Today, under the leadership of the talented Diana Skelton, the 
      club continues that tradition - with special enthusiasm for well-known 
      songs.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In summary, the 
      Terrell Rotary Club continues as a vibrant organization, dedicated to 
      serving the community and fulfilling the ideals of the Rotary movement.

      <span class="auto-style2">Chartered April 1, 1917</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Back in the distant 
      past, when Rotary was a comparatively young organization, and a few years 
      before it became international in scope, a group of forward-looking 
      Waxahachie citizens decided that Rotary would be a good thing for the 
      city. This group, which included such leaders as Ed Dubose, H.N. Naylor, 
      George Mizell, Sales Middleton, John Bert Graham, Cal Nall, S.P. Spalding, 
      and others, began serious work for the organization of a club. Their big 
      task was to convince Governor Lynn B. Milam that Waxahachie could support 
      a Rotary Club. At that time Rotary International frowned upon the 
      organization of a club in a city under 10,000 inhabitants. After a number 
      of meetings in Dallas and Waxahachie, Governor Milam decided to risk it, 
      and on February 22, 1917, an organizational meeting was held at the Rogers 
      Hotel and plans were outlined for the formation of a club.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The membership was 
      thrown open to the business men of Waxahachie, and when a man put his name 
      up for membership, his classification was then closed to any other person 
      in his line of business. The list, when finally completed, had 35 names 
      appended to it, and was sent to Rotary International for approval. The 
      charter was formally granted on April 1, 1917.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">At the first regular 
      election of officers in June, Ed Dubose was elected president; H.N. 
      Naylor, secretary; and George Mizell, treasurer. In December of that year, 
      Mr. Naylor moved to another city and John Bert Graham was elected to fill 
      the un-expired term. At that time the attendance record of the club was in 
      poor shape. Rotary's prediction about a club in a small town seemed about 
      to come true. The secretary and the president held a lengthy conference, 
      and it was determined that the only way to build a club was to start at 
      the bottom again. Consequently, the roll was gone over and all members 
      that had missed four consecutive meetings were dropped from membership. 
      Twenty members were left on the rolls, and with this nucleus the officers 
      began building anew. The standard of excellence has not been lowered 
      since.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Cal Nall represented 
      the club at the first district conference held after the admission of the 
      club into Rotary, and this meeting was held in Shreveport, Louisiana. The 
      following year the meeting was held in Corpus Christi, Texas and R.L. 
      Sullivan and John Bert Graham were sent as representatives. Much of the 
      inspiration that helped revive the club was received at this meeting</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The White Rock Club 
      was sponsored by the Rotary Club of Fair Park and was organized under the 
      direction of the late Eugene R. McDaniel, then the President of that club. 
      The organizational meeting of our club was held on October 27, 1959, at 
      7:30 p.m. in the Board Room of the East Dallas Bank and Trust Company. An 
      application for Charter was made to Rotary International, a constitution 
      and by-laws were adopted, and provisional officers and directors were 
      elected. An official meeting day of Friday was set. There were 
      twenty-three charter members.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Immediately after the 
      organizational meeting, the Club began weekly luncheons at the Casa View 
      Country Club. On January 8, 1960, the meeting place was changed to the 
      Cabana Room of the Lido Motel, now the Lamplighter. White Rock Rotary 
      received their charter on January 29, 1960. Over the years the meeting 
      place has changed many times, but the service area of the club has 
      remained the area East of White Rock Lake between Ferguson Road on the 
      South, I-635 on the North and I-30 on the East. Most of the club's 
      community service projects are within the area.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club has ranged in 
      size from the 23 original members to as many as 60, but most years have 
      had membership ranging from 35-50. Presently 15 of our 34 members have 
      been in the club at least 15 years with 10 of those being members 25 years 
      or more! We have 19 Past Presidents as members and still have our charter 
      member, Raymond Rike in the club.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">An early community 
      project of the Club was the sponsorship of the White Rock Y.M.C.A. 
      Swimming Relays. We provided assistance in holding the relays that drew 
      about 200 participants annually. These swim meets were held from 1967 
      through 1977. An on-going community project is the Bachman Recreation 
      Center Annual Chili Gala. This event has been held annually for the past 
      20 years and was renamed the Woody Bruton Bachman Chili Gala in 2001 to 
      honor our member who initiated the project. This Rec Center provides 
      activities for the physically and mentally challenged in Dallas. Our Gala 
      provides lunch and musical entertainment for between 150 and 400 
      participants. An area high school country and western band, Lake Highland 
      Wranglers, provides entertainment for the attendees. We see, as a key to 
      membership retention, the active involvement of all our members in our 
      on-going club activities programs. To that end we have a variety of 
      programs requiring different levels of energy and time so the member can 
      fit in service as his/her time allows. We are involved in elementary 
      school tutoring, visitation with senior citizens in a local retirement 
      center, maintenance of a local cemetery and planting in the medians of 
      neighborhood streets.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">E.M. Bruhns was the 
      Club's first Treasurer and continued in that position for about 15 years. 
      E.M., who died in 1992 at the age of 100, established the E. M. Bruhns 
      Foundation. Funds from the foundation are available to the club for grants 
      to worthy and needy organizations in the White Rock area.</font></p>

		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Contribution to the 
      Rotary Foundation has been an emphasis of the Club since its early years. 
      The club has produced 42 Paul Harris Fellows who have contributed in 
      excess of $60,000. Our Club has hosted the incoming Group Study Exchange 
      Team on two occasions and in 1998 sponsored the GSE Team Leader, White 
      Rock Rotarian Roger Pryor, when our district exchanged with Chile. We also 
      hosted several Rotarians who were attending the Rotary International 
      Convention in Dallas in 1982.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">White Rock Rotary has 
      produced one district Governor, Wally Lynch, who served the District in 
      1993-1994. He was a Rotarian who exemplified the principles of Rotary and 
      gave it his energy, time and intellect.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In 2001, the Club 
      received approval for a Rotary Foundation Matching Grant. The project 
      involves the raising of chickens by about 200 families in Uganda and 
      matches our Club and District with the Rotary Club of Bweyogerere-Namboole 
      in Kampala, Uganda. The project activities include the purchase of 6,000 
      chicks, a central brooding unit and the training of the Ugandans 
      participating. Win Evans, President-elect of our Club, has been 
      instrumental in coordinating and managing our end of the project.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Finally, about 15 
      years ago White Rock Rotary established a program to recognize a Policeman 
      of the Quarter. About the same time we started recognizing other 
      outstanding folks in the community and honoring them with a &quot;Nobody Does 
      It Better&quot; Award. In April of this year, we will honor a mentally 
      challenged young man who has volunteered more than 5,000 hours of work in 
      the Scottish Rite Hospital for Children. We have just renamed the award to 
      honor one of our late members, Ed Crow, who &quot;did it&quot; better!</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">White Rock Rotary is a 
      tight-knit group of Rotarians who enjoy serving the community and putting 
      Service Above Self. We have added six new members in the past eight months 
      and expect to double that number by year-end, June 30th. We invite 
      like-minded individuals to join with us to accomplish together that which 
      individuals find difficult to achieve.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">A local banker and his 
      fellow citizens chartered the Whitesboro Rotary Club in 1928. Charter 
      President was Harry T. Cowell, the banker; Vice-President was A. E. Boyd, 
      school superintendent; Secretary/Treasurer was Fred Suggs, city secretary; 
      Sergeant-at-Arms was Dr. W. B. Younger, local veterinarian. There were 16 
      others, to make a total of 20 for the new club. Other classifications 
      included a grocer, ice house operator, oil mill operator, lumberyard 
      manager, Magnolia oil agent, gasoline distributor, insurance agent, dry 
      goods merchant, Ford dealer and the owner of the Whitesboro newspaper.

		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club was organized 
      on October 8 and officially admitted by Rotary International on October 
      24, 1928. Charter No. is 1976, District 581, and District Governor was 
      Walter E. Kingsbury.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">74 years later you can 
      see that things have not changed that much. We have today, as in 1928, a 
      local banker as our President. We have city employees, current and retired 
      school superintendent, gasoline distributor, news reporter, a grocer, car 
      dealer, two dentists, an attorney, several business owners, public 
      officials, chiropractor, and more bankers than you would expect!</font></p>

		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Rotary Club 
      participates in several fund-raisers, but the one that had the greatest 
      personal touch was the Rotary International Polio Plus Campaign. Several 
      Rotarians said this really touched their hearts, and for a club our size, 
      our members gave generously. We very actively participate in the 
      Whitesboro Peanut Festival with a booth that raises money for scholarships 
      (5); food drive at Thanksgiving and Christmas; Loy Lake Livestock Show 
      with financial contributions for local participants; annual Special 
      Olympic Track Meet, when Rotarians work in food booths; deliver 
      Meals-on-Wheels once a month to shut-ins.</font></p>

      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Whitesboro Rotary Club 
      members are very visible in all community activities such as serving as 
      Chamber of Commerce officers and directors, local employment, helping 
      people in need through local community Thanksgiving Fund Drive. For the 
      size club that we are, we feel that the Whitesboro Rotarians are certainly 
      carrying out the &quot;Spirit of Rotary&quot; in a tremendous way!</font></p>

      <span class="auto-style2">The Rotary Club of Wylie</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1"><b>
      <span class="auto-style2">Chartered March 31, 1989</font></span></b></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Rotary Club of 
      Wylie began as an idea in 1985. Chuck Trimble, a charter member of the 
      Plano Metro Rotary Club worked at a CPA firm in Plano. In 1987 Chuck 
      started a firm in Wylie and decided the drive was too long to Plano Metro 
      Club. Asking the district for help, Trimble and a fellow Rotarian, Chuck 
      Croissant, from the Plano Rotary Club, began the mission of starting a 
      club in Wylie.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The Farmersville 
      Rotary Club agreed to sponsor Wylie. Bob Tedford and Mont Hendricks, 
      members of the Farmersville club, committed to meet with the Wylie club 
      weekly until the official chartering on March 31, 1989. Initially the club 
      met at a restaurant. The club has for several years met at the fellowship 
      hall in the First Baptist Church in Wylie.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club established 
      college scholarships given each year to Wylie students attending Collin 
      County Community College. These $1,000 scholarships are given to students 
      based on financial need and to students pursuing teaching careers though 
      not a requirement. Several recipients have said the scholarships meant the 
      difference in their ability to continue with plans to attend college. Each 
      year two recipients have been chosen to receive the awards.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Sponsoring local 
      students to Camp RYLA every year has also become an important tradition. 
      The club has been very successful in the selection of students receiving 
      this award. Many have been asked to return the following years after they 
      have attended their initial year. Usually two student and sometime three 
      students have been sponsored by the club.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Painting and repairing 
      elderly people's homes in Wylie is a recurring project as well. The club 
      has several people in Wylie watching for potential recipients of these 
      projects. Usually, a widow or widower on a limited, fixed income, needs to 
      have his house painted and small repairs made. A few weekends during the 
      year are set aside to do the work. Most of the members join in the effort 
      regardless of talent. Young people in the community needing to perform 
      community service work via the justice system are assigned by the local 
      justice of the peace to help with the fix up projects. This effort has 
      been a good way for Rotarians to make an influence on these youth.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">In 2000 the club 
      constructed the Rotary Children's Playground in one of the city parks with 
      high quality playground equipment and landscaping. The club planned the 
      entire project, raised the necessary funds, purchased the equipment, and 
      installed it in place at the park. The playground has a sign telling the 
      citizens that the club built the park. Children regularly play on the 
      equipment.</font></p>
		<p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
		&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">Wylie participates in 
      the exchange program as well as mini exchange and hopes to continue the 
      practice. Students have been exchanged with districts in France and 
      Germany. One outbound student sent to Toulouse, France, learned to speak 
      French so well, that he was able to receive advanced placement of several 
      college hours from Texas A&amp;M University.</font></p>
      <p class="auto-style8" align="left">The club is probably 
      best known for its good fellowship at the meetings, a tradition of 
      singing, and the Wheel of Misfortune as a fun way to correct infractions 
      of the members. The Rotary Club of Wylie has become fixture in the Wylie 
      community with its members involved in all levels of community leadership.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><p class="auto-style2" align="left" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
