			The Very Early Days<p><br>
			While visiting a brother in Denver during 1912, Harry B. Wheelock, a 
			leading Birmingham architect, learned of a new organization called 
			Rotary which had originated in Chicago and was spreading fast. Upon 
			his return home, he discussed Rotary with his business and 
			professional friends, and it was decided that further information 
			was needed. Wheelock, along with Thomas H. Molton, John W. Sibley 
			and John E. Shelby, visited clubs in Denver, Los Angeles and other 
			cities, and returned home with enthusiasm for this new ideal of 
			service.<br>
			<br>
			On February 6, 1913, at a meeting held in the Directors Room of the 
			Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, 32 men heard an address by Chesley 
			R. Perry, Rotary's Perennial Secretary, and that day completed the 
			organization of the Birmingham Club with Charter No. 56.<br>
			<br>
			The <b><a href="6860.htm">Birmingham Club</a></b> immediately began extending Rotary by assisting 
			in the organization and formation of clubs in Atlanta, Memphis, 
			Montgomery, Mobile, Nashville, Savannah, Macon, Tampa, Selma, 
			Ensley, Bessemer, Tuscaloosa and other areas. At the 1914 Convention 
			in Houston, Texas, John E. Shelby, a charter member of the 
			Birmingham Club, was elected Regional Vice-President with territory 
			covering most of the Southeast and duties similar to those of a 
			present-day District Governor. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			DISTRICT NO. 5<br>
			At the 1915 Convention in San Francisco, the U.S. was divided into 
			districts and District Governors were elected. Our area became 
			District No. 5, and Frank P. Glass, a member of the Birmingham Club, 
			became District Governor of the three-state area of Alabama, Georgia 
			and Florida.<br>
			<br>
			In the early days, it was the belief of the National Association 
			that a club could not survive in towns with a population of less 
			than 50,000, so the formation of clubs in Pensacola and Selma was 
			delayed somewhat. However, Pensacola was organized in 1915 and Selma 
			in early 1916, so the barrier had been broken, opening the door for 
			the formation of clubs with men of goodwill, regardless of the 
			community size. Today, the vast majority of Rotary Clubs are located 
			in population centers of less than 50,000.<br>
			<br>
			At the 1916 Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, District 5 was expanded 
			to include Cuba, a club having been organized in Havana. <br>
			<br>
			At that time, District Conferences had not been established, so the 
			District 5 delegates at the Cincinnati Convention held a caucus and 
			nominated Ralph D. Quisenberry, of Montgomery, as District Governor. 
			This nomination was confirmed by the Convention.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			The First District Conference<br>
			District Conference guidelines were established at the Cincinnati 
			Convention, and the first District 5 Conference was held in 
			November, 1916, at Jacksonville, Florida, with District Governor 
			Ralph D. Quisenberry presiding and 125 Rotarians in attendance.<br>
			<br>
			In 1917, the first Convention with the new name of the International 
			Association of Rotary Clubs (IARC) was held in Atlanta, Georgia, on 
			June 17-21, and the clubs of the 5th District acted as joint hosts. 
			As their part of the entertainment, the Alabama clubs secured the 
			floats used in the Mardi Gras parade in Mobile and repeated this 
			pageant in Atlanta. It was said that this was a brilliant 
			undertaking.<br>
			<br>
			The Gadsden Club was organized and chartered by Governor Quisenberry 
			in April, 1917.<br>
			<br>
			Malcolm D. Jones, of Macon, Georgia, was elected District Governor 
			at the Atlanta Convention. He approved the election and chartered 
			the Anniston Club in September and the Huntsville Club in November, 
			1917.<br>
			<br>
			The second District Conference was called to order in Selma on March 
			4-5, 1918, by District Governor Jones. The special representative of 
			Rotary to the Conference was H. J. Brunnier of San Francisco who 
			addressed one hundred seven Rotary Club delegates who were in 
			attendance.<br>
			<br>
			At this Conference, John G. Gay of Jacksonville, Florida, was 
			nominated District Governor and was elected at the Kansas City 
			Convention held June 24-28, 1918.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			DISTRICT NO. 8<br>
			At the Kansas City Convention, our District number and area changed. 
			A Rotary Club having been chartered in San Juan, Puerto Rico, our 
			District was expanded to include this new area. The territory now 
			included in District No. 8 was Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Cuba and 
			Puerto Rico.<br>
			<br>
			The Dothan Club, which had been operating as an independent club 
			along the lines of a Chamber of Commerce, was reorganized under the 
			direction of District Governor Gay into a Rotary Club in September, 
			1918, when it was elected to membership in the International 
			Association of Rotary Clubs.<br>
			<br>
			April 9-10, 1919, was the date of the District Conference held in 
			Albany, Georgia, with District Governor Gay. Chesley R. Perry, 
			General Secretary of Rotary, was the representative of the President 
			to this Conference.<br>
			<br>
			This District Conference passed two resolutions adopting policy and 
			procedure:<br>
			<br>
			1. A regular program of work among boys which led to Rotary Youth 
			Programs.<br>
			<br>
			2. Established a ten-day period of time in which a club member could 
			object in writing to a proposed member.<br>
			<br>
			Truman L. McGill of Selma was nominated as District Governor and was 
			elected at the Convention in Salt Lake City, June 16-20, 1919.<br>
			<br>
			The Rotary Club of Opelika was chartered in May, 1919.<br>
			<br>
			The 1920 District Conference was held at Tampa, Florida, on March 
			28-29, with Governor McGill presiding. Rotary Vice-President Estes 
			Snedecor represented the President. Attendance was 457 men and 202 
			women for a total of 659, by far the largest attendance to date. 
			W.R.C. Smith of Atlanta, was nominated for District Governor and was 
			elected at the Atlantic City Convention, June 21-25, 1920. Also, at 
			this Convention, Puerto Rico was removed from District 8 due to the 
			distance from other clubs.<br>
			<br>
			Governor McGill delivered several club charters in Alabama, Georgia, 
			Florida and Cuba. Those in Alabama were Bessemer in February, 
			Sheffield in March, and Troy in April, 1920.<br>
			<br>
			Birmingham was the site of the 1920 District Conference with a 
			registered attendance of 698 men and 210 women for a total of 908, a 
			new high. District Governor W.R.C. Smith presided, and John C. 
			Henley, Jr.,of Birmingham, was Secretary of the Conference. Dr. 
			Crawford C. McCullough, First Vice-President of Rotary, was the 
			official representative to this Conference. There were 47 clubs in 
			the District at this time.<br>
			<br>
			It was at this Conference that a resolution was passed asking the 
			International Association of Rotary Clubs to consider scheduling a 
			Constitutional Convention to be held separate from the International 
			Convention.<br>
			<br>
			John A. Turner of Tampa, Florida, was nominated District Governor 
			and was elected at Edinburgh, Scotland, June 13-16, 1921.<br>
			<br>
			The Cuban delegates, because of the language difference, as well as 
			local conditions, asked the Conference to adopt a resolution 
			requesting that the International Board consider the formation of a 
			separate district for Cuba.<br>
			<br>
			Governor Smith delivered charters to four new Alabama clubs: 
			Andalusia in November, Talladega in December, 1920, Florence in 
			January, and Eufaula in May, 1921. The average attendance in the 
			District this year was 61.5 percent.<br>
			<br>
			The 1922 District Conference was held in Savannah, Georgia, March 
			23-24, with Governor Turner presiding and R. W. Groves as Secretary. 
			Second Vice-President William H. Coppock represented the Rotary 
			President. Attendance was 762 men and 113 women, for a total of 875. 
			James S. Thomas of Tuscaloosa was nominated District Governor and 
			elected at the Convention held in Los Angeles. Governor Turner 
			delivered charters to Tuscumbia in November and Brewton in April.<br>
			<br>
			This Conference passed several resolutions, but we will mention only 
			two here. One resolution complained of the large amount of material 
			and forms being sent out by &quot;Headquarter Officers.&quot; Another was 
			related to &quot;stunts.&quot; The resolution &quot;conceded that stunts are a 
			necessary part of Rotary entertainment,&quot; and suggested the District 
			Governor's office be the clearing house for &quot;stunts&quot; in order that 
			each club have a good supply.<br>

			<br>
			DISTRICT NO. 26<br>
			At the Convention held at Los Angeles, July 5-9, 1922, a new 
			constitution was adopted and the named changed to Rotary 
			International. The clubs in North America were restricted and an 
			attempt was made to eliminate state lines. The 8th District was then 
			too large to be properly supervised by one District Governor and it 
			was divided into two, nearly equal parts and renumbered, the western 
			half being the 26th and the eastern part the39th.<br>
			<br>
			The original plan was for the territory in western Florida, 
			including Tallahassee and the western part of Georgia, including 
			Rome, West Point, LaGrange and Columbus, to be in the 26th District. 
			After petition of the clubs named, however, the Board assigned them 
			to the 39th, and the 26th District was then redefined as the state 
			of Alabama and that part of Florida located west of the 
			Appalachicola River. This change left Pensacola as the only club in 
			the 26th District not located in the State of Alabama.<br>
			<br>
			Governor Thomas delivered charters to the clubs in Demopolis in 
			January and at Jasper in March, 1923.<br>
			<br>
			On November 17th, an &quot;All Alabama Rotary Day&quot; was held in Mobile. 
			The District Governor's report on the day had this to say, &quot;Mobile, 
			replete in history, famed for hospitality, beautiful in buildings, 
			harbor and scenery, fairly outdid itself when the Rotarians arrived. 
			George Lining and Bill Lott must have lain awake nights thinking up 
			all the nice things they were going to do to the gang, and Haygood 
			Patterson of Montgomery brought the most beautiful posies and 
			decorated every Rotarian until one would have thought it was the 
			Auburn football team on parade after winning from Tech! In the 
			evening, a regular feed with ladies and all and a real Rotary talk 
			by Bill Armbrecht on &quot;Springs.&quot; The Governor also spoke, as did Bob 
			Mangum (Selma) and Haygood Patterson (Montgomery). Pat was accepting 
			the attendance cup when he spoke, so he made it snappy and full of 
			big words but Bob he was talking of the ladies in Rotary and Bob has 
			had some experience and with his inspiration right at hand, how he 
			did let it fly!&quot;<br>
			<br>
			The first Conference of the 26th District was held in Birmingham on 
			March 15-16, 1923, with Governor Thomas presiding and L. L. Doty as

			The 1925 District Conference was held in Mobile on March 16-17. The 
			galaxy of international orators, as well as those from our own 
			district, together with local entertainment and gastronomic features 
			were above anything that had been presented at previous Conferences 
			and were such as have not been attempted since. Governor Turner (no 
			mean orator himself) presided and had on his program Allen D. 
			Albert, Past President, IARC, 1915-16; Alan R. McFarlane of 
			Vancouver, British Columbia, a member of the International Board,

			<br>
			At this Conference, Will Archer spoke strongly and with feeling 
			regarding the work with Crippled Children and Adults. He explained 
			and gave emphasis to the work he felt Rotary could and should do 
			with Crippled Children and in the rehabilitation of handicapped 
			adults.<br>
			<br>

			when we entertained another gathering of international personages. 
			The late James W. Davidson and Mrs. Davidson, of Calgary, Alberta, 
			who shortly before had carried Rotary around the world, represented 
			the International Board. Richard G. Cox, of Gulfport, Mississippi, 
			and Carl Faust, of Jackson, Mississippi, both past International 
			Directors, helped make Governor Brubaker's program a success. The 
			outstanding entertainment feature was a pageant, &quot;The Making of 
			America and Americans, Through Rotary Remaking the Nations,&quot; an 
			original production arranged especially for this occasion. The 
			attendance was: men 307, women 74, total 381. Perry W. Reed was the 
			Secretary.<br>

			The &quot;Club Executive's Conference,&quot; a forerunner of our District 
			Assembly, was held this year. Some Rotarians questioned its value 
			and purpose. Of the 27 clubs in the District, all but four were 
			represented.<br>

			<br>
			The &quot;District Assembly&quot; was held at Pensacola, Florida, on July 
			22-23. Of the then 30 clubs, only 21 had representation. District 
			Governor Morgan Richards made the following observation in his 
			report to Rotary International following the Assembly, &quot;It is 
			noticeable that several of the clubs not represented are on the list 
			of the clubs that need attention.&quot; (The picture has not changed.)<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			1930 - The Depression Years<br>
			Birmingham was host to the District Conference on April 14-15, 1930. 
			Governor Richards presided and George M. Lemmon was Secretary. The

			<br>
			During the year 1930-31, the effects of the Depression were 
			commencing to be felt; there was a decrease in membership and no new 
			clubs were formed, all the energy being devoted to hold what we had.<br>
			<br>
			The District Assembly went to Montgomery on July 7-8, 1930, and of 
			the then 31 clubs in the District, 29 were represented.<br>

			<br>
			The clubs at Marianna and Pensacola, Florida, asked the District to 
			approve a transfer of those clubs to the 39th District so that they 
			could be affiliated with all the other Florida clubs. This change 
			was approved, the International Board made it effective on July 1, 
			and we lost our close contact with these splendid clubs. This, then, 
			made the definition of the 26th District &quot;The State of Alabama.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			The State of Alabama<br>
			John C. Henley, Jr., of Birmingham, was nominated District Governor 
			at the Gadsden Conference and was elected at the Convention at

			<br>
			<br>
			Many New Clubs<br>
			There was a change in the Rotary policy during that year and 
			practically the whole energy of Governor Ayers was devoted to the 
			organization of new clubs in territories which, for the most part, 
			had been considered too small for clubs or otherwise unsuitable for 
			Rotary. The extension of Rotary to the smaller places in the 
			District had its effect on the larger clubs also, and when the 
			District Conference was held at Huntsville on April 18-20,1937, the 
			District membership had grown to 1,438, with new clubs at Athens, 
			Brantley, Marion, Reform, Tuskegee and York and, by July 1,

			The growth of Rotary being so great, requiring redistricting, and 
			for housekeeping reasons, District numbers were changed even though 
			the territory remained the same.<br>
			<br>
			George Klimes of Birmingham was nominated District Governor at the 
			Huntsville District Conference and was elected at Nice, France, on

			New clubs had been chartered at Ashland, Brundidge, Cullman, 
			Evergreen, Fairhope, Greensboro and Wetumpka.<br>
			<br>
			District Fund Set Up<br>
			At the District Assembly held in Montgomery earlier in the year, a 
			new plan was adopted to care for a certain part of the expenses of 
			the District Conferences. At the Conference held in 1923, 
			arrangements were made for each club to put up fifty cents per 
			member for the fixed expense of the Conference and an additional 
			fifty cents per member for the special expense, making a total of 
			$1.00 deposited for Conference expenses. This was to be disbursed by 
			a special committee and sums left over, if any, were to be divided 
			between the donors. This committee was appointed for several years 
			and then it was abandoned and the matter was handled by the host 
			club committee. For several years, this club committee attempted to 
			get sufficient funds for their needs, leaving out those clubs which 
			objected.<br>
			<br>
			When met with opposition, it was decided to pay the entire $1.00 per 
			member to the District Fund, to contribute a stated sum to the 
			Conference host club and to use the balance for district matters. 
			Commencing with the Dothan Convention, this was done.<br>
			<br>

			Dodge City, Kansas, who was accompanied by his wife. Past Director 
			Walter D. Head of Teaneck, New Jersey, later named President of 
			Rotary International, was also present and addressed the gathering. 
			Congressman Representative Joe Starnes of Guntersville, gave a very 
			interesting talk on the work of the Dies Committee of Congress.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Rotarians of the Briny Deep<br>
			At this point in time, in 1938, the federal government maintained a 
			passenger boat of 400 capacity which was docked in Mobile Bay. 
			Regulations pertaining to its use required the request of a 
			congressman who served the area. He was required to come to the area 
			involved and accompany the passengers on the journey.<br>
			<br>
			Governor Cole and the Conference Committee turned to Congressman Joe 
			Starnes for his service. At that time, most travel was done by train 
			and not plane. As a result, the Congressman traveled all night and 
			part of the next day before he reached Mobile. It must be pointed 
			out that the delegates at the Convention learned of the details of 
			this adventure and insisted that we devote a part of the Convention 
			time to this phase.<br>
			<br>
			At noon on Friday, the delegates assembled at the bayside with 
			strong expectations of the interesting event. Suffice it to say, we 
			moved the afternoon session to the boat and sailed the mighty deep.<br>
			<br>
			Fellowship and observation characterized the journey. Delegates met 
			delegates they had not known before. This had the effect of 
			increasing fellowship and friendship while viewing the scenes along 
			the way.<br>
			<br>
			Frank L. Grove, of Montgomery, was nominated District Governor and 
			elected at the International Convention at Cleveland, Ohio, in June,

			in which every club made a contribution to the Rotary Relief Fund. 
			$1,671.79 was donated by Alabama's Rotary Clubs for the relief of 
			distressed Rotary families in the war-torn areas.<br>

			Total membership as of February, 1942 stood at 1,876.<br>
			<br>
			Harry Hall, District Governor for the Rotary Year 1941-42, continued

			representative at the Conference, and Clyde Orr of Bessemer was 
			nominated for District Governor.<br>
			<br>
			During this year, the District raised and sent to Rotary 
			International $2,600.00 for the purchase of a field ambulance. All 
			clubs contributed to the &quot;Rotary International Relief Fund.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			District attendance for the year was 83.17% and, at the end of the 
			year, membership was 1,883.<br>
			<br>
			The Rotary year of 1942-43 was a good year, even in the heart of the 
			war. Travel was limited and Governor Clyde Orr had some difficulty 
			in making his appointed rounds.<br>
			<br>
			The District Assembly was in Montgomery again to conserve travel. Of 
			the 46 clubs in the District, 40 were represented with 106 
			attending.<br>
			<br>
			The District Conference was held in Birmingham with a total 
			attendance of 465 men and 109 women. Frank Spain was nominated as 
			District Governor and Abit Nix was Rotary International 
			representative.<br>
			<br>
			During this year, Rotary International was asking each District 
			Governor to give reports on the activities of Rotary with the 
			Defense Council work. Information asked for reflected Rotary 
			activities in Civil Defense, blood banks, salvage drives and defense 
			counselor training or other activities aiding the defense movement.<br>
			<br>
			Total membership at the end of the Rotary year was 2,011 and the 
			district attendance for the year was 82% - good for the war year.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			International Understanding Stressed<br>
			Rotary in 1943-44 was most concerned with advancing international 
			understanding. District Governor Frank Spain devoted much time and 
			energy to this phase of Rotary during his year. He planned and 
			conducted 31 Institutes on International Understanding involving all 
			of the 47 clubs then in the District. The emphasis given to this 
			phase of Rotary by Frank Spain is alive today in Rotary in Alabama.<br>
			<br>
			The District Assembly was held in Birmingham on June 23, 1943. 
			Fifteen of the 47 clubs were not represented, due mainly to 
			restricted travel. Attendance was limited with only 72 present.<br>
			<br>
			The District Conference was in Montgomery on April 24 and 25, 1944. 
			Of the 48 clubs in the District, only four were not represented. 
			Total attendance was 334 men and 95 women for a total of 429.<br>
			<br>
			Robert E. Heun of Richmond, Indiana, a Past Vice President, was 
			Rotary International representative, and John McClure of Tuscaloosa 
			was nominated for District Governor.<br>
			<br>
			The Conference adopted a resolution commending Algernon Blair of 
			Montgomery for his interest, work and leadership in Rotary. The 
			resolution read in part, &quot;We believe few districts in all Rotary 
			have so benefited by the qualities of leadership you have evidenced 
			throughout all the happy years we have enjoyed your wise counsel, 
			your unceasing interest, your kindly philosophy and your 
			wholehearted helpfulness.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			The District contributed $1,454.41 for relief to Rotarians and their 
			families in war countries. At the year's end, there were 2,110 
			Rotarians and the District attendance for the year was 83.07%.<br>
			<br>
			District Governor John McClure held two District Assemblies in his 
			year; one in Montgomery on July 17 and one in Birmingham on July 20, 
			1944. Forty of the 42 clubs were represented at one of the 
			assemblies.<br>
			<br>
			Due to the war situation and restricted travel, it was decided not 
			to have a District Conference during the Rotary year 1944-45. Rotary 
			International passed this suggestion on to all districts.<br>
			<br>
			Richard H. Wells, President of Rotary International, visited the 
			District during the year. His only appearance in the District was 
			with the Birmingham Club.<br>
			<br>
			John W. Inzer was nominated for District Governor. The average 
			attendance for the District was 83.73% and membership totaled 2,206 
			Rotarians on June 30, 1945.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Frank Spain Nominated for Director<br>
			District Governor John Inzer again had two assemblies during the 
			Rotary year 1945-46, the first in Montgomery on July 2 and 3, and 
			then in Birmingham on July 9 and 10. Thirteen of the 49 clubs were 
			not represented. Travel restrictions continued to influence the 
			Rotary program.<br>
			<br>
			The District Conference was held in Birmingham on April 22 and 23, 
			1946. Of the 50 clubs at that time, 43 were represented at the 
			Conference. Total attendance was 547, with 400 men and 147 women. Of 
			this number, 389 were from the host club. Phillip Lovejoy 
			represented Rotary International at this Conference. Phillip is well 
			remembered by Rotarians of Alabama.<br>
			<br>
			This Conference endorsed a resolution supporting Frank E. Spain for 
			Director for Zone Four. Lewis Smith of Ensley was nominated for 
			District Governor.<br>
			<br>
			Phillip Lovejoy, in his report to Rotary International following the 
			Conference, had this to say regarding a part of the program by Paul 
			Grist, &quot;A grand presentation of community service and it could be 
			used in the international picture.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			John Inzer, in his Annual Report, said: &quot;Without exception, on my 
			visits I found the clubs had a rather low and poor ebb if their 
			officers had not attended our District Assemblies . . . &quot;<br>
			<br>
			Awards were given during the year and Tuscaloosa received the 
			President's Award for outstanding work in all phases of Rotary. The 
			Governor's Award went to Decatur for Club Service, Bessemer for 
			Community Service, Demopolis for Vocational Service and Montgomery 
			for International Service.<br>
			<br>
			Average attendance for the year was 79.47%. On June 30, 1946, the 50 
			clubs had 2,517 Rotarians as members.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Attendance and Membership Grows<br>
			The year 1946-47 showed continued growth in membership and 
			attendance. The war years had its claim on both.<br>
			<br>
			District Governor Lewis M. Smith started the year with his District 
			Assembly in Montgomery on July 22 and 23. Eight of the 51 clubs were 
			not represented. Attendance at the Assembly was 146. Governor Lewis 
			reported, &quot;Delegates sat behind tables facing the speaker's platform 
			similar to that at the International Assembly.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			Frank Spain of Birmingham was serving Rotary International as a 
			Director. Frank was on his way to greater service to Rotary.<br>
			<br>
			The District Conference went to Huntsville on April 20-22, 1947. 
			Eleven of the 52 clubs were not represented. Total attendance was 
			344.<br>
			<br>
			<a href="../../presidents/1967hodges/index.htm">Percy Hodgson</a> of Narragansett, Rhode Island, was Rotary 
			International representative to the Conference. Percy later became 
			President of Rotary. In his report to Rotary International, Percy 
			described the Conference as &quot;excellent, equipped very well, a grand 
			Conference, well conducted and instructive.&quot; As the weakest feature 
			he said, &quot;Too many long-winded speeches by some Past District 
			Governors.&quot; James T. Upchurch of Montgomery was nominated for 
			District Governor. Ensley received an award for Outstanding Club of 
			the Year.<br>
			<br>
			Governor Lewis' Annual Report showed 51 clubs with 2,695 members and 
			the average District attendance 82.76%.<br>
			<br>
			Governor Upchurch held his District Assembly in Montgomery on July 
			21 and 22, 1947. Only five clubs were not represented. Attendance 
			was the best - 164 Rotarians. In addition, in the training phase of 
			the Assembly, Governor Jim brought to the attention of those in 
			attendance such items of business as district financial condition, 
			possible re-districting of Alabama and the appointment of a District 
			Fund Committee. Action taken later in the year will reflect results 
			of these discussions.<br>
			<br>
			The District Conference was held in Montgomery on March 28-30, 1948. 
			Of the 52 clubs in the District, 51had representation at the 
			Conference. Total attendance was 466. Richard E. Brenor of Chicago, 
			was the President's representative at our Conference.<br>
			<br>
			Records from this Conference indicate this was the first Conference 
			in which each club registered 15% of their membership in advance. 
			This was later changed to 20%. A resolution was offered Rotary 
			International requesting the state be divided into two districts and 
			that the dividing line be the southern boundary lines of Chambers, 
			Tallapoosa, Coosa, Shelby, Bibb, Tuscaloosa and Pickens Counties.<br>
			<br>
			Roy Hickman, of Birmingham, was nominated District Governor. During 
			this year, Frank Spain was serving as Third Vice-President of 
			Rotary. Rotary International representative Richard Brenor, in his 
			report to Rotary International made the following comments: &quot;A good 
			conference, no weak points, the District needs to be divided in that 
			the Governor had to travel over 17,000 miles to get his job done, 
			and Governor Jim Upchurch is a whiz-bang.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			Demopolis received the President's Award, and the Annual Governor's 
			Report showed 52 clubs with 2,812 members on June 30. The District 
			attendance for the year was 85.15% - a new high.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Alabama Divides</b></p>
			<p>District Governor Roy Hickman was the last of the long list of able 
			Rotarians serving as District Governor of the entire state. During 
			the year, Alabama was to be divided into two districts.<br>
			<br>
			Governor Roy carried his District Assembly to Tuscaloosa on June 25 
			and 26, 1948. The total attendance was 175 with all but three of the 
			52 clubs represented.<br>
			<br>
			The District Conference was in Mobile this year on April 24-26, 
			1949. Total attendance was 712 which was the best since before the 
			war years. It seems fitting that Mobile was host to this Conference 
			and records reflect the fine job they did in the overall planning 
			and execution of every detail. The Mobile Rotarians are not to be 
			outdone in staging a District Conference. Of the then 56 clubs in 
			the District, only two were missing.<br>
			<br>
			Charles G. Tennent of Ashville, North Carolina, was the President's 
			representative to the Conference. Charles later became President of 
			Rotary. In his report to Rotary International, Charles had only 
			praise for &quot;the excellent program and the hospitality extended by 
			the Mobile Club.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			The Annual Report submitted to Rotary International by Governor Roy 
			showed 57 clubs with 3,005 members on June 30, 1949. The average 
			District attendance for the year was 85%.<br>
			<br>
			During this year, a committee composed of Past District Governors 
			Joe Duckworth, Harry Hall and Houston Cole made a study of the state 
			and, finally, recommendations were made for dividing the state into 
			two districts. Their recommendations were accepted and approved by 
			the Board of Directors of Rotary International - the division to be 
			effective July 1, 1949. The northern part of the state was to be 
			known as District 238 and the southern part as District 239.<br>
			<br>
			The division gave District 238 the greater number of Rotarians - 
			1,433 in 25 clubs. District 239 inherited 27 clubs with 1,376 
			Rotarians. <br>
