		<img class="auto-style26" height="493" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/districts/images/1270chart1.png" style="float: left" width="500">Almost all the 
		clubs in District 1270 can trace their origins back to just three which 
		were started between 1919 and 1922. These three were Sheffield, Hull and 
		Lincoln, although there were other early clubs, among which were 
		Rotherham, which was chartered in 1921, Doncaster in 1922 and Barnsley 
		in 1923.<br><br>In 1915 the Rotary Clubs in Britain were combined into a 
		single district, then known as Rotary District 19. When the World War 
		ended in 1918, there were only 22 clubs in this country, of which just 
		four, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds and Newcastle, were the sole 
		representatives in the North of England, while another four, Nottingham, 
		Birmingham, Leicester and Derby, represented Rotary in the Midlands. It 
		was clear, however, that in the following years many more clubs would be 
		created and to take account of future development, a British districting 
		system was organised in 1918 in which the North of England was 
		designated as District 1 and the Eastern Counties including Lincolnshire 
		became District 3. <br><br>These were British Districts as opposed to 
		the Rotary International ones in which the whole of GB and I was 
		District 19. In 1923, the original 6 districts had increased to 16 and 
		Lincoln became part of District 7 Midlands, East, while Sheffield and 
		Hull were in District 4 Yorkshire. 4 and 7 subsequently became 104 and 
		107 and more recently 1040 and 1070. In the early 70s, moves were made 
		to sub-divide these further and eventually, a new grouping 127 (1270) 
		was created to take in clubs from much of South Yorkshire, an isolated 
		club in North Yorkshire (Selby), together with East Yorkshire and 
		Lincolnshire, but, in both cases, not all of them.<br><br>It was the 
		Manchester Club under its President, Peter Thomasson, which was most 
		helpful to some of the fledgling clubs at this period and particularly 
		to a group in Sheffield. A local optician, Alfred Peters, had visited 
		Manchester on business many times and had guested at the Rotary Club 
		there. Impressed by what he had seen, he gathered together some local 
		business and professional men and on July 16, 1919, seven of them met to 
		discuss the formation of a Sheffield Rotary Club. <br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="443" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/districts/images/1270chart2.png" style="float: left" width="500">Just 7 weeks later, the new club held its 
		first meeting and the official inaugural meeting was held the following 
		month at the Kings Head Hotel, with visiting speakers from the 
		Manchester, Newcastle and Nottingham Clubs, together with 16 founder 
		members. The Club's Charter was presented in early January 1920. From 
		this beginning, the Sheffield Club started a chain of clubs which are 
		shown in the District family tree. Their first was Rotherham just a year 
		after their own formation, and soon afterwards, Doncaster; with 
		Rotherham and Doncaster, Sheffield jointly developed a new club in 
		Mexborough in 1924, For many years, the club continued to be involved in 
		extension in what is now South Yorkshire.<br><br>Where Manchester had 
		helped Sheffield, it was now the turn of Will Moffatt of Leeds, later to 
		be District Chairman, to help the next club, the Rotary Club of Hull. 
		Exactly when the club was first mooted, is uncertain but by February 6, 
		1920, the club had a full slate of officers and was meeting regularly at 
		the Grosvenor Hotel in Carr Lane. Both Alfred Peters (Sheffield) and 
		Peter Thomasson (Manchester) had visited the new club by then. It was 
		not long before the Hull Club received its charter, dated May 1, 1920. 
		As was happening elsewhere, Hull saw 'extension' as important and small 
		groups were convened to take Rotary further afield, initially to Goole 
		and Grimsby, neither of which took root at first, and more successfully 
		to Beverley in 1927. Hull persevered with extension and Grimsby was 
		eventually inaugurated in 1930 and chartered the following year.<br><br>
		The idea of forming a Lincoln Rotary Club was proposed at a meeting at 
		the Great Northern Hotel on March 16, 1922 when several prominent 
		citizens gathered to hear about Rotary from Vivian Carter, a London Club 
		member and secretary of the British Association of Rotary Clubs. It is 
		not clear which if any of the existing clubs assisted in the formation 
		of this club, although at a meeting in the Albion Hotel in June, the 
		visiting speaker was Canon Elliot of Leicester. It seems probable 
		therefore that support for the new club came from clubs in District 7, 
		Midlands East, from Leicester and Nottingham. Soon after their 
		chartering in December 1922, Lincoln was invited to consider extension 
		in all directions and was in some areas, successful, although Grimsby 
		was actually developed from the North rather than Lincoln to the South!!<br>
		<br>Almost every club in the District can trace its beginning to these 
		three originals, sometimes directly, sometimes through a chain of other 
		clubs.<br><br>The District Clubs have also been instrumental in 
		extension work in mainland Europe, particularly Doncaster in the period 
		between the world wars. Vienna and Budapest acknowledged Doncaster as 
		their original parent club and there were also strong links with Prague.<br>
		<br>Among several prominent Rotarians, perhaps the best known are Bill 
		Huntley and Sir Nigel Gresley. Bill Huntley, QV, a member of the Alford 
		and Mablethorpe Club, was successively District Governor of D122 in 
		1977/78, President of RIBI 1986/87 and President of RI 1994/95. Sir 
		Nigel Gresley, QV, was an early member of the Doncaster Club and is 
		better known as a locomotive designer. Edwin Robinson of Sheffield 
		1935/36. R.E. Richardson of Grimsby 1966/67 and John Hockin of Woodhall 
		Spa 1999/2000 were also Presidents of RIBI.<br><br>Basil Lewis</td>
