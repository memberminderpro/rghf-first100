		the clubs in the order in which they became affiliated with Rotary 
		International and they were assigned a charter number based on the date 
		that they were elected to membership in Rotary International. After WWII 
		in about 1951, Rotary stopped using the numbering system that it had 
		before the war. Today's assigned numbers are for financial purposes and 
		are not placed on the charter nor should they be considered for order of 
		entry into Rotary International. After a club is terminated (for any 
		reason) should they be re-affiliated within a year, they would retain

		CHARTERING AND THE NUMBERING OF CLUBS<br><br>Officially a Rotary Club 
		only moves from the 'interim' (provisional) stage to full membership 
		when it receives its Charter. In the early period of Rotary, clubs had 
		to apply for affiliation to the newly formed National (or from 1912, 
		International) Association of Rotary Clubs. Sometimes because of 
		administrative delays or even lack of knowledge of the correct 
		procedure, some of Rotary's earliest clubs failed to be chartered for 
		several months or even years after their inaugural meeting. Thus, 
		Winnipeg was formed at a meeting on 3 November 1910, but did not receive 
		its Charter until 1912.<br><br>A similar situation occurred with the 
		clubs in Britain where news of their creation could take a long time to 
		reach Chicago. Because there was occasionally some dispute about the 
		amount of the affiliation fee, not all clubs joined immediately. This 
		has led to discrepancies in the numbering of the clubs. Thus:</td>
