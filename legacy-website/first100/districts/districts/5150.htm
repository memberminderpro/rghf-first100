		<b><font size="4" color="#800000">HISTORY OF ROTARY’S WEST COAST 
		DISTRICT: 5150</font></b><br>
		<br>
		Organizations of all kinds flourish and grow in proportion to the 
		dedication and strength of their membership and their leaders. The 
		growth and strength of Rotary International reflects the service given 
		by its members within their districts over the years. <br>
		<br>
		Our West Coast District 5150 has been given different numbers over the 
		years. But its record of achievement within the geographical area 
		designated by Rotary International has been matched by only a handful of 
		Rotary districts over the years.<br>
		<br>
		From the beginning of the first Rotary Club in Chicago, until 1915, 
		there were no Rotary Districts. Clubs acted independently and came 
		together in exchanges between clubs that were geographically close in 
		proximity, and at national meetings organized by Paul Harris and Ches 
		Perry of the Chicago club. <br>
		<br>
		<b><a href="../../presidents/1952brunnier.html">H. J. “Bru” Brunnier</a></b> 
		was President of the Rotary Club of San Francisco in 1914. <b>He is 
		recognized as the originator of the district idea in Rotary</b>. His 
		idea came about during a regional fellowship gathering at a six-city 
		meeting in Tacoma, Washington. Returning by train from Seattle following 
		the conference, Bru awakened in the middle of the night with his idea. 
		He summoned a porter to bring him a railroad schedule of the United 
		States, which also included a map of the USA. Bru’s involvement in 
		Rotary provided him with knowledge of the location of most of the 100 
		clubs in Rotary at that time. He placed them on the railroad schedule 
		map with dots to show their location. He then combined the clubs on the 
		basis of rail transportation and arrived at 13 groupings. <b>His map and 
		his idea formed the basis upon which Rotary leaders adopted the district 
		plan at the <a href="../../presidents/conventions/1915/index.htm">Rotary Convention of 1915 in San Francisco</a>.
		</b> <br>
		<br>
		In 1918, due to the tremendous growth of clubs in Rotary, Bru was again 
		asked to assist in placing Rotary clubs in new districts. Called upon 
		for a third time in 1923, Bru worked with a redistricting committee to 
		redistribute clubs within districts. The committee needed to consider 
		the explosive growth that was continuing in Rotary due to the chartering 
		of new clubs all over the country and the world. Following 1923, Bru 
		excused himself from further involvement in redistricting clubs, since 
		there was much “trauma” in moving clubs to new districts because of 
		geographical necessities. <br>
		<br>
		Even today, redistricting becomes necessary as Rotary’s growth 
		throughout the world continues to add new clubs to its rolls. 
		Redistricting is also inevitable when certain areas in Rotary continue 
		to grow rapidly and others lose clubs and members. Redistricting is an 
		unhappy event in Rotary, as personal friendships, made over years of 
		district gatherings, are interrupted when clubs are assigned to new 
		districts.<br>
		<br>
		District 5150 has been involved in many changes in its geographical 
		makeup. This is not surprising when one considers that from the 100 
		clubs in 1915, Rotary has grown to over 32,500 clubs and over 530 
		Districts in 2007. How District 5150 grew in importance to Rotary, while 
		actually losing more than 90% of its geographical territory is an 
		interesting story.<br>
		District 13: 1915-1918<br>
		<br>
		<b>District 13 came into existence in 1915 with H. J. “Bru” Brunnier of 
		San Francisco as its first District Governor.</b> Bru’s territory was 
		the largest territory in our history. Bru was responsible for clubs 
		within the states of New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California, as 
		well as for the territory of Hawaii. Most of the clubs in existence at 
		the time were in California. Bru traveled to every state in the 
		District, recruiting new clubs as he went. Following Bru’s year as 
		District Governor, Homer W. Sumption of San Diego (1916-17) and Dr. 
		Dewey R. Powell of Stockton (1917-18) led the district as DGs. <br>
		<br>
		<b>District 23: 1918-1922</b><br>
		<br>
		In the redistricting of 1918, our District’s geographical area remained 
		the same. 
		<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
		<br>
		Clinton E. Miller of Los Angeles served as the first governor of the 
		newly renumbered District in 1918-19. He was followed by Alex Sheriffs 
		of San Jose in 1919-20, Leslie S. Everts of San Diego in 1920-21, and 
		Charles B. Bills of Sacramento in 1921-22.<br>
		<br>
		<b>District 2: 1922-1937</b><br>
		<br>
		As a result of the third redistricting effort by Rotary, our District 
		lost territory and was given a new number. District 2’s territory became 
		the States of Nevada, California, and the territory of Hawaii. <br>
		<br>
		This was the period of time that included WWI, the flapper age, and the 
		depression years. Much good happened over this period of time with many 
		new clubs being formed during the early years, and the District 
		maintaining its numbers throughout the depression years. By the middle 
		of 1937, District 2 included 170 clubs within its territory, and almost 
		8,500 members. Division of our large District became inevitable. <br>
		<br>
		Our District Governors who led us during a time of tremendous growth and 
		into the depression years, are: John R. Williams of Long Beach in 
		1922-23, Paul Rieger of San Francisco in 1923-24, Harry S. Mason of Los 
		Angeles in 1924-25, Thomas B. Bridges of Oakland in 1925-26, Fred 
		McClung of Huntington Park in 1926-27, Almon E. Roth of Palo Alto in 
		1927-28, Herbert E. Harris of Whittier in 1928-29, Harvey B. Lyon of 
		Oakland in 1929-30, Arthur S. Crites of Bakersfield in 1930-31, David J. 
		Reese of Bakersfield in 1931-32, Charles D. Hayward of Berkeley in 
		1932-33, Edward B. DeGroot of LA in 1933-34, Herbert K. Walton of San 
		Rafael in 1934-35, George W. MacLellan of Santa Barbara in 1935-36, and 
		Marshall DeMott of Corning in 1936-37.<br>
		<br>
		During this period of time,
		<a href="../../presidents/1930roth/index.htm">Almon E. Roth</a> [now in 
		the RC of San Francisco] became Rotary’s Second Vice President in 
		1929-30; and in 1930-31 Almon E. Roth became President of Rotary 
		International. In 1931-32 Almon E. Roth continued to serve on Rotary 
		International’s Board of Directors. <br>
		<br>
		<b>District 104: 1937-1949</b><br>
		<br>
		Following an extensive study of new district territories, our formerly 
		very large District was divided into five new ones. These five districts 
		were in California and Nevada. The shrinking of our geographical 
		territory meant that District 104 included only 30 clubs in 1937. Over 
		the next twelve years, District 104 [from Hollister on the south, to 
		Arcata on the north, including 10 counties of the Coast of Northern 
		California] grew to 43 clubs. <br>
		<br>
		Our leaders led District 104 from peacetime to war and back again into 
		peacetime. They were <a href="../../presidents/1943wheeler.html">Charles L. 
		Wheeler</a> of San Francisco in 1937-38, Floyd A. Parton of San Jose in 
		1938-39, Russell O’Hara of Vallejo in 1939-40, Harry A. Mitchell of San 
		Francisco in 1940-41, Roy N. Dreiman of Santa Cruz in 1941-42, Frank J. 
		Brennan of Eureka in 1942-43, J. Percy Robinson and Melvin Hitchcock of 
		San Mateo in 1943-44, Prentiss A. Rove of San Francisco in 1944-45, 
		Joseph L. Gabriel of Hollister in 1945-46, Clarence C. Price of Vallejo 
		in 1946-67, Frank E. Allen of Burlingame in 1947-48, and Harold D. 
		Bostock of Santa Rosa in 1948-49.<br>
		<br>
		<b>District 155: 1949-1957</b><br>
		<br>
		Renumbering our District in 1949 did not change our territorial limits. 
		Our District continued to include the Northern California counties of 
		Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Sonoma, Napa, Marin, San Francisco, San 
		Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, San Benito, and the Rotary Club of 
		Vallejo. Continued chartering of new clubs in the District throughout 
		this period enlarged our District to 51 clubs.<br>
		<br>
		We were led during this period by Herbert S. Shuey of San Francisco in 
		1949-50, William E. Williams of San Jose in 1950-51, Bernard J. Bush of 
		Garberville in 1951-52, William Otis Callaway of Burlingame in 1952-53, 
		Wallace S. Myers of San Anselmo in 1953-54, G.P. Bacon of Santa Cruz in 
		1954-55, E. W. Stephens of San Francisco in 1955-56, and George P. 
		Chaffey of Vallejo in 1956-57.<br>
		<br>
		<b>District 513: 1957-1970</b><br>
		<br>
		No changes in the territory of the District were made when the District 
		number was changed to 513. During this thirteen-year period, the 
		District grew by three clubs, but new member growth within the clubs 
		took the District membership to over 4,000. Our leaders during this 
		period included Monroe E. Brown of Burlingame in 1957-58, Lloyd Hayes of 
		Sebastopol in 1958-59, Dr. Walter J. Hamilton of San Carlos in 1959-60, 
		Francis Whitmer of San Francisco and Dr. Walter J. Hamilton of San 
		Carlos in 1960-61, Norman LeLaittre of Cloverdale in 1961-62, Percival 
		M. Bliss of West San Jose in 1962-63, Harold E. Tucker of Garberville in 
		1963-64, <a href="../../presidents/1981mccaffrey.html">Stanley McCaffrey</a> 
		of San Francisco in 1964-65, George Starbird of San Jose in 1965-66, 
		Stanley L. Lance of Santa Rosa in 1966-67, Jack B. Power of Palo Alto in 
		1967-68, Robert E. Barwick of Napa in 1968-69, and Harold Graves of Mill 
		Valley in 1969-70.<br>
		<br>
		<b>District 513: 1970-1989</b><br>
		<br>
		Once again redistricting reduced the size of our District, although the 
		District 513 number did not change. The counties of Santa Clara, Santa 
		Cruz, and San Benito were placed into another district, as was the 
		Rotary Club of Vallejo. Thus, District 513 now contained the nine 
		counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Lake, Napa, Sonoma, Marin, 
		San Francisco, and San Mateo. This left the District with 42 clubs and 
		3,239 members to start the new decade of the 1970’s. <br>
		<br>
		District 513 remained in this configuration for the next 19 years. 
		Tremendous growth occurred during this time, bringing the total clubs in 
		the District to 67 and a membership of 4,784. Our leadership included 
		Ray Winther of So. San Francisco in 1970-71, Charlie Strope of Eureka in 
		1971-72, Alfred D. Quilici of San Rafael in 1972-73, John K. Withers of 
		West Santa Rosa in 1973-74, Robert C. Glidden of So. San Francisco in 
		1974-75, William A. Jamieson of Fortuna in 1975-76, George P Newlon of 
		San Mateo in 1976-77, Arthur W. Agnew of Petaluma in 1977-78, Robert J. 
		Paroli of Menlo Park in 1978-79, Harry C. Empey of Santa Rosa in 
		1979-80, Reuben W. Kaehler of Novato in 1980-81, Robert R. Rockwell of 
		San Francisco in 1981-82, Richard D. Keith of West Santa Rosa in 
		1982-83, Clifton C. McGarr of San Rafael in 1983-84, Larry D. Myers of 
		South Ukiah in 1984-85, Norman Lawrence of Ignacio in 1985-86, Sidney 
		Berlin of Redwood City in 1986-87, Aldo Simonetti of Burlingame in 
		1987-88, and Robert V. Kane of Tiburon-Belvedere in 1988-89.<br>
		<br>
		<b>District 515: 1989-1991 and District 5150: 1991-date</b><br>
		<br>
		The growth of District 513 once again created an inevitable 
		redistricting for our District. This time, redistricting meant that a 
		new District was created and District 515 became our District. It is the 
		smallest territory we have ever had, containing only Marin, San Mateo, 
		and San Francisco counties. We initially started with 31 clubs, and 
		under 2,300 Rotarians. Only two governors led District 515, as in 1991 
		Rotary International decided to add a ”zero” to each district’s number. 
		In 1991, our District became District 5150, and has remained so ever 
		since. In the almost 20 years of our smaller geographic District, we 
		have added eight new clubs for a total of 39. Membership as of 2007 is 
		over 2,000. <br>
		<br>
		Our leaders during the past 20 years include <b>William B. Sturgeon</b> 
		of San Francisco #2 in 1989-90, William Conklin of Redwood City in 
		1990-91, Dale W. Luehring of Mill Valley in 1991-92, Thomas G. Bormes of 
		San Mateo in 1992-93, Charles C. Swensen of Ross Valley in 1993-94, Jon 
		B. Grant of Foster City in 1994-95, Tony DeAngelis of Millbrae in 
		1995-96, Lou Bartolini of San Rafael in 1996-97, Dave Cresson of Half 
		Moon Bay in 1997-98, Mary Janney of Burlingame in 1998-99, Michael Fish 
		of Ignacio in 1999-00, “EZ” Eric Zorr of Mission San Rafael in 2000-01, 
		Peter C. Lagarias of San Francisco #2 in 2001-02, Greg Molloy of Terra

		Moon Bay in 2004-05, Holly Axtell of Marin Evening in 2005-06, Mark 
		Flegel of Menlo Park in 2006-07, Brian McLeran of Terra Linda in
