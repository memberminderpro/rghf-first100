		By 1981 District 992 had 
		grown to 68 Clubs. These clubs covered a huge area of the Pacific Ocean 
		from Western Samoa in the north to the northern part of New Zealand’s 
		North Island in the south, Norfolk Island and the French colonial 
		territory of New Caledonia.. The size of the District precluded District 
		Governors adequately assisting clubs to fulfill their Rotary objectives 
		and do justice to the numerous District Committees. It became obvious 
		that a new District had to be created and among the strongest advocates 
		was 1981-62 District Governor Hugh Francis of the Mount Roaskill club. 
		An investigating committee chaired by PDG Dr W. Grattan O’Connell was 
		formed.<br><br>An arbitrary line was drawn across the Auckland isthmus 
		from Onehunga on the West Coast to North Head of the Waitemata Harbour 
		on the East Coast. Clubs situated to the north of that line became part 
		of the new District 991, those to the south, including the Auckland Club 
		remained in District 992. Of the Pacific Islands, Port Vila and Santo in 
		Vanuatu, Noumea and Ducos Boulari in New Caledonia, and Norfolk Island 
		were incorporated into the new District while those in Western Samoa, 
		Tonga, Rarotonga, Fiji remained with D992. The division was not met with 
		universal approval by many of the re-districted clubs. Despite efforts 
		by succeeding District Governors to include it in District 9910 the 
		French Polynesia club of Papeete remained un-districted until 2004-2005, 
		when it was included, <br><br>There was no District Nominating Committee 
		to select a District Governor and PDGs Mel Cooper (1980-81) and Peter 
		Taylor (1977-78) of the O’Connell committee approached PP Ron Trotman of 
		the New Lynn club to accept the position of Charter District Governor. 
		Faced with the rather daunting task of setting up a new District from 
		scratch, Ron determined that his project for the year was to build an 
		entity on solid foundations and to embrace as fully as possible all 35 
		metropolitan and rural clubs. The new District 991 came into being on 1 
		July 1983 with 14 District Committees. There was a close liaison on the 
		International Service Committee with its District 992 counterpart. Two 
		committees, Student Exchange and Rotaract/Interact were not established 
		until the following year.<br><br>Two District Awards, the Onehunga Cup, 
		presented by the Onehunga club for best attendance at District 
		Conference and the Jack Keys Cup presented by the Warkworth Club for the 
		best Club Bulletin were apportioned to the new District and over the 
		years many awards for outstanding club performances have been given by 
		Past District Governors.<br><br>The highlight of that first year was the 
		District Conference held at Forum North in the northern city of 
		Whangarei, the organising clubs being New Lynn (Auckland) and Whangarei, 
		Whangarei North and Whangarei South. The RI President’s Representative 
		was Cliff Dochterman. The city had some reservations as to its ability 
		to stage an event of such magnitude, as it was the largest function of 
		its kind to be hosted by the city, but which spared no effort to ensure 
		its success. .Shops and streets were decorated and Radio Broadcasts 
		advertised the event. it was an unqualified success attended by 728 
		registrants, setting a pattern for the future. <br><br>John Swinburne of 
		the Warkworth club succeeded Ron Trotman and continued his policy of 
		embracing all clubs. His District Assembly was held in the northern town 
		of Dargaville and the District Conference at the country’s northernmost 
		town of Kaitaia which was virtually taken over by Rotarians with the 
		enthusiastic support of the townspeople who went to great lengths to 
		make it a very happy event. The policy of embracement continues. Though 
		disadvantaged by distance and separation from mainland New Zealand, the 
		“island clubs” contribute greatly to the Rotary ideals and to District 
		9910. Vanuatu’s two clubs, Port Vila and Santo, mainly comprising 
		expatriates on temporary secondment by their companies are vital parts 
		of their communities, as is the tiny Norfolk Island club and the three 
		clubs in French New Caledonia; Noumea, Ducos Boulari and Noumea Ouen 
		Toro. Over recent years there has been a decline in Rotaract with all 
		clubs going into recess, but following the RYLA seminar in 2005, one new 
		club has been established on Auckland’s North Shore.<br><br>The 44 clubs 
		of District 9910 continue to support and innovate programmes of Service. 
		In 1985 the District established RDU Rotary Supplies New Zealand as the 
		official supplier nationally of Rotary and Probus supplies. In 1986 it 
		established an association with the Australian National Youth Science 
		Forum enabling one student from each of the six New Zealand Districts to 
		attend annually at the Forum held at the Australian National University 
		in Canberra. In 1990 it established the Rotary International New Zealand 
		Science &amp; Technology Forum in which approximately 20 senior secondary 
		school Science students from each District and six Australian students 
		attend a two week long hands-on experience of advanced Science at the 
		University of Auckland, Auckland University of Technology, Massey 
		University (Albany Campus) and Unitech Institute of Technology while 
		living in a university hall of residence. In 1990, also, a programme to 
		combat Malaria and Dengue Fever was instituted in the island state of 
		Vanuatu in combination with the Vanuatu clubs. A maternity annexe at 
		Santo Hospital and a Tuberculosis Ward at the Port Vila Hospital have 
		been constructed also in Vanuatu together with the provision of storage 
		tanks for potable water. In conjunction with the Rotary Club of Mid Rand 
		in Africa a WCS programme is in place. Currently this involves, 
		agriculture, sewing, bead making and brickmaking. A storage facility is 
		maintained to receive Donations in Kind and similar goods pending their 
		dispatch overseas. A wide range of youth, child literacy, child health, 
		and drug education programmes are actively supported as are those of The 
		Rotary Foundation, Vocational, Community, International Service and 
		Youth.<br><br>Auckland city is the home of many Asian immigrants and in 
		2005 the District chartered the Rotary Club of North Shore with 24 
		charter members of both genders. Unique to New Zealand, the meetings are 
		transacted in the Korean language, and the club is fully involved in all 
		District projects.<br><br>On 30 November, 1998, the District suffered a 
		grievous blow with the death of DG Cedric Kelly, a popular and highly 
		respected Rotarian, and son of PDG Ashton Kelly (1964-65). Driving the 
		170 km from his home in Whangarei to an Official Visit to the North 
		Shore City Club in Auckland, Cedric suffered a fatal heart attack. His 
		duties were assumed by PDG Geoff Dainty (1997-98) for the remainder of 
		that year. The District suffered a further blow early in 2005 with the 
		untimely death of DGE Neil Boyd-Bell, a dedicated and loved Rotarian and 
		member of the Henderson club.. PP Graeme Bellingham, also of Henderson 
		accepted the invitation of the District Nominating Committee and filled 
		the office with distinction. A legacy from Neil Boyd-Bell’s planning for 
		his year in office is the establishment in July 2006 of the District 
		Secretariat under District Administration Manager and District Secretary 
		Ken Fearnley of the Henderson club.<br><br>District 9910 Governors<br>
