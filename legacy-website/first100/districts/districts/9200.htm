		When the first Rotary Club in Kenya, that is the Rotary Club of Nairobi 
		was chartered on the 8th September 1930, it joined the then District 55, 
		which consisted of countries south of Equator in Africa. The other 
		countries that had Rotary Clubs in District 55 at that time were Belgian 
		Congo, Southern Rhodesia, and Union of South Africa. With the admission 
		of Rotary Club of Nairobi the District had a total of 13 clubs, one each 
		in Belgian Congo, Southern Rhodesia and Kenya. The rest of 10 other 
		clubs were in Union of South Africa. District Governor in that year was 
		late Otto Siedle of Rotary Club of Durban.<br><br>In the year 1949 – 50 
		the District was renumbered 25 and the following year that is in 1950 – 
		51 it was split into two Districts to form District 25 and District 26. 
		District 25 as it was then, consisted of 24 clubs in four countries with 
		a membership of 1036. These countries were Kenya. Southern Rhodesia. 
		Tanganyika and part of Union of South Africa. By then there were two 
		clubs in Kenya - Nairobi and Mombasa, one club in Tanganyika - Dar es 
		Salaam, four clubs in Southern Rhodesia and 17 clubs in part of Union of 
		South Africa. Rotary club of Mombasa was admitted into RI on 24 May 1944 
		and Dar es Salaam on 25 January 1949. Also, listed in the district were 
		Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Bechuanaland, Swaziland, Madagascar and 
		Mozambique although there were no Rotary clubs yet chartered in those 
		countries.<br><br>During the next decade Rotary spread to many East, 
		Central and Southern African Countries. Ethiopia: 1955, Uganda 1957, 
		Malawi: 1955, Zambia: 1953, Madagascar: 1958, Reunion: 1960, Swaziland: 
		1955, South West Africa: 1952. This expansion necessitated further 
		redistricting beginning Rotary year 1961-62 when District 220 came into 
		existence with 48 clubs in 9 countries with a total membership of 1644. 
		These countries were Kenya, Madagascar, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, 
		Southern Rhodesia, Tanganyika, part of Republic of South Africa and 
		Uganda. Other clubs in District 25 and 26 in Swaziland, South West 
		Africa and part of Republic of South Africa as well as Angola were 
		redistricted to form District 230 and 235. Ethiopia was not part of 
		District 220 although Rotary Club of Addis Ababa was chartered on 01 
		June 1955. Rotary Club of Saint Dennis in Reunion, which was chartered 
		on 17 February 1961, was also not included in District 220 at that time. 
		The first District Governor of this new district was late Meloo 
		Mac-Robert of Rotary Club of Pretoria.<br><br>The next two years saw 
		steady growth of Rotary in Africa. There were also political problems 
		and racial tension in southern part of Africa, which for all practical 
		purposes needed regrouping of clubs. In 1963 – 64 there was further 
		redistricting. Southern Rhodesia, South West Africa and Republic of 
		South Africa were transferred to districts 225, 230 and 235. District 
		220 consisted of Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Northern Rhodesia, 
		Nyasaland, Tanganyika, Reunion and Uganda. The first District Governor 
		of this new district was late J. R. Gregory. In subsequent years Rotary 
		Clubs were formed in Mauritius (1964), Comoro Islands (1965) Territories 
		of Afars and Issa what is now called Djibouti (1967). These were 
		incorporated in District 220 as of 01 July 1968. Rotary Club of Victoria 
		in Seychelles was chartered in 1969 and Rotary Club of Gaborone in 
		Botswana was chartered in 1972. These were incorporated in District 220, 
		while Rotary clubs in Malawi were transferred to District 225 with 
		effect from 01 July 1970. Rotary Club of Zanzibar, which was formed in 
		1961, was also part of District 220. However, the club was down in 1964 
		after the revolution.<br><br>In the year 1977 – 78 the district was 
		renumbered 920 and at the beginning of that Rotary year, there were 45 
		clubs with a membership of 1504 in twelve countries …… Botswana, Comoro, 
		Islands, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion, 
		Seychelles, Tanzania Uganda and Zambia. A year later, three clubs in 
		Ethiopia namely, Asmara, Dire Dawa and Masawa were closed down and with 
		extension of Rotary in Kenya, Mauritius, Reunion, Tanzania and Zambia 
		there were a total of 48 clubs with a membership of 1645 in these twelve 
		countries at the beginning of Rotary year 1983-84.<br><br>In 1983-84, 
		five new clubs were chartered …. two in Uganda (Kabale and Kabarole) two 
		in Zambia (Maluba and Kafue) and one in Kenya (Bahari Mombasa).<br><br>
		As of 01 July 1984 there were 53 clubs with a membership of 1748. During 
		1984-85 six new clubs were formed as under:<br><br>Masaka, Mbarara and 
		Gulu in Uganda.<br>Selebi Phikwe in Botswana<br>Saint Paul in Reunion<br>
		Antsirabe in Madagascar.<br>In the same year special representative were 
		appointed for 13 new clubs. As of 30 June 1985 there were 59 clubs in 
		District 920 with a total membership of 1979. In the next two years a 
		total of eight new clubs were formed as under:<br><br>Diani and Mombasa 
		Central in Kenya.<br>Nkwazi in Zambia.<br>Quatre Bornes in Mauritius.<br>
		Morogoro in Tanzania (which was subsequently closed down)<br>Rubaga 
		Uganda.<br>Antananarivo Mohamasina and Fianarnatsova in Madagascar.<br>
		As of 30 June 1987 there were a total of 66 clubs with a membership of 
		2132. Below is the tabulation of clubs country wise:<br><br>BOTSWANA 02, 
		COMORO ISLANDS 01, DJIBOUTI 01, ETHIOPIA 01, KENYA 12, MADAGASCAR 09, 
		MAURITIUS 04, REUNION 05, SEYCHELLES 01, TANZANIA 07, UGANDA 10, ZAMBIA 
		14. TOTAL: 66<br><br>Effective 01 July, 1987 the district was split into 
		two that is 920 and 921. Countries in District 920 were Djibouti, 
		Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius, Reunion, Seychelles and Uganda. The numbers 
		of clubs were 34 with a membership of 1175. Somalia was also included in 
		the district although at the time there were no Rotary Clubs in Somalia. 
		It is interesting to note that Rotary Club of Mogadishu in Somalia was 
		chartered in 1961-62, which unfortunately had to close down in 1972 due 
		to political conflict in the country. District 921 consisted of 
		Botswana, Comoro Islands, Madagascar, Tanzania and Zambia with a 
		membership of 957 in 32 clubs. The first governor of new District was 
		Sam Owori of Uganda and that of 921 was Abe Galaun of Zambia. Effective 
		Rotary year 1991-92 a zero was added to all district thus making four 
		digit districts. As such District 920 became 9200.<br><br>Over the next 
		few years both districts expanded and at the end of Rotary year 1995-96 
		there were 79 clubs in District 9200 and 47 clubs in District 9210. 
		Effective 1996 –97 these two Districts were further split as under:<br>
		<br>1. Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda were redistricted 
		to form District 9200 with 66 clubs and 1791 members.<br><br>2. Zambia 
		was grouped with Malawi, part of Mozambique, and Zimbabwe to form 
		District 9210 with 44 clubs and 1305 members (previously Malawi, 
		Mozambique and Zimbabwe were part of District 9250).<br><br>3. A new 
		District 9220 was formed incorporating 36 clubs in Comoro Islands, 
		Djibouti, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion and Seychelles with a 
		membership of 1010.<br><br>4. Botswana, which had 5 clubs, was 
		transferred to District 9250.<br><br>Amin Merali of Rotary club of 
		Mombasa was the first Governor of new District 9200. Of the 66 Clubs in 
		the District 3 were in Ethiopia, 20 in Kenya, 8 in Tanzania and 35 in 
		Uganda.<br><br>New era of District 9200 as it exists now began in the 
		Rotary 1996 – 97 when District 9200 had a total of 66 clubs.<br><br>
		Between 1996 – 97 and the end of the century Rotary grew in all the 5 
		countries in the District and as at 30 June, 2000 the total number of 
		clubs in the District was 78 as tabulated below:<br><br>ERITREA - 1<br>
		ETHIOPIA - 6<br>KENYA - 22<br>TANZANIA - 8<br>UGANDA - 41<br><br>Over
