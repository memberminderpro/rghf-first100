										Lucky for us and millions of others 
										throughout the world, Paul Harris was 
										not a &quot;Nay&quot; sayer. Paul took action on 
										his vision and built an organization for 
										the future.<br>
										<br>
										The year is 1905. Teddy Roosevelt is 
										president of the U.S. More than 100 
										motorcars are displayed at the New York 
										Auto Show with prices ranging from $400 
										for a runabout to $8,000 for a richly 
										upholstered 40 horsepower limousine. 
										Oklahoma is admitted to statehood, with 
										New Mexico and Arizona as the only 
										territories remaining. In Indiana, Lew 
										Wallace, author of &quot;Ben Hur&quot;, is dead at 
										the age of 71. And in Chicago, the 
										vision of a young lawyer, who felt lost 
										and alone in the sprawling city, becomes 
										reality.<br>
										<br>
										On a cold, windy Thursday night, 23 
										February 1905, Paul Harris and three 
										friends meet to discuss an idea of 
										Paul's to recapture some of the friendly 
										spirit that existed among businessmen in 
										small communities. The three men - 
										Silvester Schiele, a coal dealer; 
										Gustavus Loehr, a mining engineer' and 
										Hiram Shorey, a merchant tailor - meet 
										in Gus Loehr's office - room 711 of The 
										Unity Building at 127 North Dearborn 
										Street. As you know, from this meeting 
										came the world's first service club - 
										Rotary - and as the saying goes &quot;The 
										rest is history&quot;.<br>
										<br>
										The founding four were of U.S., German, 
										Swedish and Irish ancestry, representing 
										Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish 
										faiths. There is no evidence to suggest 
										that Paul planned this diversity, but as 
										products of the American Melting Pot, 
										they were fitting representatives of the 
										international organization they brought 
										into being.<br>
										<br>
										A fifth member, Harry Ruggles, a 
										printer, was soon enlisted, and the 
										group organized as The Rotary Club of 
										Chicago. The first roster indicated a 
										membership of 30, with Silvester Schiele 
										as president. Paul Harris declined any 
										office and did not become its president 
										until two years later. Harry Ruggles was 
										the man who began the custom of group 
										singing. In 1907, the first community 
										service project -- a 
										<a href="../../library/rotarian/1940scrapbook/1940scrapbook1.htm">public comfort 
										station</a> -- was installed near city hall.<br>
										<br>
										Paul was often asked if he thought -- on 
										that cold, wintry night of 23 February 
										-- that Rotary would grow into the 
										international service organization that 
										it has become. Perhaps his best answer 
										was given shortly before his death in 
										1947: &quot;No. I did not in 1905 foresee a 
										worldwide movement..when a man plants an 
										unpromising sapling in the early 
										springtime, can he be sure that someday 
										here will grow a mighty tree? Does he 
										not have to reckon with the rain and the 
										sun -- and the smile of providence? Once 
										he sees the first bud -- ah, then he can 
										begin to dream of shade .&quot;<br>
										<br>
										It didn't take long for the tree to bud 
										and the shade of Rotary to spread. Three 
										years after Chicago, a second club was 
										founded in San Francisco and the 
										following year, three more were started. 
										By 1910, there were 16 clubs with 1,500 
										members scattered across the U.S. Rotary 
										became international in 1911 with a club 
										in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and at the 
										1912 convention in Duluth, Minnesota the &quot;National Association of 
										Rotary Club&quot; gave way to the 
										&quot;International Association&quot;.<br>
										<br>
										The year is now 1913 -- both New Mexico 
										and Arizona are states, having been 
										admitted on January 6, and February 14, 
										1912 respectively. Woodrow Wilson is 
										president. In California, Richard Nixon 
										is born. Financier J.P. Morgan is dead 
										at age 76 and in New York, Harriet 
										Tubman dies at age 92. In Washington, 
										congress passes a bill to impose a 
										graduated income tax, but congress 
										promises that it will be limited to a 
										maximum six percent on those making 
										above $500,000 per year. In Indiana, <b>
										<a href="../../clubs/cities/clubs/84terrehaute.htm">The 
										Rotary Club of Terre Haute</a></b> becomes the 
										first club in what is now District 6580. 
										The second club to be chartered was<b><a href="6580.htm"> 
										Evansville</a></b> in 1914, and Vincennes and 
										New Albany came on board in 1915.<br>
										<br>
										These four clubs were followed by 
										Princeton and Bloomington in 1918; 
										Madison, Washington, Franklin, Seymour, 
										and Bedford, in 1919, which -- with five 
										new clubs -- remains the best year ever 
										for extensions in our district. 1920 
										gave us Greensburg and Jeffersonville, 
										and Mitchell was organized in 1922. Two 
										years later in 1924 we gained Sullivan, 
										followed in 1925 by Columbus, and in 
										1926 by Bloomfield and Linton. Next came 
										Rising Sun in 1933, Aurora in 1936, 
										Brazil in 1937 and Corydon in 1939.<br>
										<br>
										In our first 26 years, from 1913 to 
										1939, we gained 22 Rotary clubs. In the 
										next 26 years we added only two -- and 
										only one of these, Salem, chartered in 
										1954 remains today. (on 8 March 1955, 
										West Terre Haute was chartered with 28 
										members. Thirty-three years later, on 22 
										March 1988, it became a casualty. West 
										Terre Haute, to this date, is the only 
										club from our district to have lost its 
										charter.) <br>
										<br>
										After West Terre Haute, it wasn't until 
										1965 that we started to add additional 
										clubs with North Vernon, followed by 
										Greenwood in 1966. However a period of 
										eight years elapsed until Bloomington 
										North in 1974. Five years later in 1979, 
										Terre Haute South was admitted. The 
										eighties with two clubs, Martinsville in 
										1980 and Seymour Noon in 1985 and the 
										nineties with three -- Evansville A.M. 
										in 1990, Brown County in 1992 and, our 
										newest club, Clarksville in 1995 brings 
										us to our present number - 32.<br>
										<br>
										When the Terre Haute club was formed, 
										Indiana was in what was called the 
										Central Division. It wasn't until the 
										Rotary year 1915-16 that clubs were 
										first grouped into districts, and all of 
										Indiana was assigned to District 8. In 
										1918-19 our district number was changed 
										to 11, and John Napier Dyer of the 
										Vincennes club was the first district 
										governor. He went on to become a 
										director and vice president of R.I.<br>
										<br>
										In 1922-23, our district number was 
										changed to 20. Frank Hatfield of the 
										Evansville Club was the second district 
										governor from the current clubs and the 
										first governor of the new district 20. 
										In Rotary year 1937-38 our district 
										number was changed to 155, and on 10 May 
										1938 Indiana was first split into three 
										districts 154, 155 and 156 from north to 
										south. Paul Crim of Evansville in 
										1938-39 was the first district governor 
										of District 156 with 21 clubs.<br>
										<br>
										We were to see two additional number 
										changes before we arrived at our current 
										6580 designation in 1991-92. In 1049-50 
										district 156 became 226 and in 1957-58 
										district 226 was changed to 658. Lynn 
										Stewart of Columbus in 1949-50 not only 
										was the first governor of District 226, 
										he also was the first half of our only 
										father/son governor team since his son, 
										Bob Stewart, served as governor in 
										1979-80. The first governor of District 
										658 and our present District 6580 were 
										both from New Albany: Bernard Webb, 658 
										in 1957-58, and Don Sodrel, 6580 in 
										1991-92.<br>
										<br>
										Terry Frey is the 65th man to serve as 
										district governor. Peggy Peter in 
										1999-2000 will be the 68th governor, but 
										the first female. Of the 64 past 
										district governors, 42 are deceased and 
										eighteen continue to be members of clubs 
										in our district. In addition to John 
										Napier Dyer, two other PDGs went on to 
										serve at headquarters: A.E. &quot;King&quot; Cole 
										from Bloomington, governor of District 
										20 in 1937-38 subsequently served on the 
										Rotary board and V. Dewey Annakin of 
										Terre Haute, governor of District 226 in 
										1950-51, became a vice president of R.I.<br>
										<br>
										Including Terry Frey from North Vernon, 
										24 clubs have provided district 
										governors. Bloomington leads the way 
										with 9, followed by Evansville and Terre 
										Haute with 6 each and New Albany and 
										Vince a45 nnes with 5 apiece. Eight 
										clubs have yet to provide a DG, with 
										Jeffersonville, chartered in 1920 and 
										Rising Sun chartered in 1933 being the 
										two oldest. The newest club to provide a 
										governor is Martinsville, chartered in 
										1980 -- Of course they gave us &quot;Conan 
										The Rotarian&quot;.<br>
										<br>
										Clubs in our district have been generous 
										supporters of our Rotary Foundation. As 
										of 31 December 1996, we had a total of 
										982 Paul Harris Fellows, 148 Sustaining 
										Members and 92 Benefactors. At last 
										years international convention in 
										Calgary, PDG Bill Cunningham was one of 
										only 31 DGs honored for achieving 75 new 
										Benefactors. All time giving in our 
										district is about $1.3 million.<br>
										<br>
										Governor Terry has asked us to honor our 
										legacy. At the end of Rotary year 
										1912-13 -- when a group of men with 
										vision were taking action in Terre Haute 
										to build for the future by starting the 
										first club in this district -- there 
										were 50 Rotary clubs with a total 
										membership of 5,000. By the year 1915-16 
										when clubs were first grouped into 
										districts, there were 20,700 members in 
										186 clubs. Today there are almost 1.2 
										million members in 28,284 clubs in 155 
										countries grouped into 518 districts.
										<br>
										<br>
										Paul Harris obviously had much more than 
										a vision. Honor our legacy by inviting 
										someone to join your club. Remember you 
										are here because someone cared enough to 
										ask you to join. Honor our legacy by 
										supporting our foundation -- PDG Orphie 
										Bridges did. From Columbus, Orphie 
										served as our 55th governor in 1986-87, 
										when I was my club president. Long 
										before he became governor, through his 
										love for our foundation and his action 
										and vision, his club led the way in 
										foundation support.<br>
										<br>
										Honor our legacy, and men of action and 
										vision like Orphie, by becoming a Paul 
										Harris Fellow and a Benefactor. Honor 
										our legacy by supporting the Four 
										Avenues of Service. Honor our legacy by 
										attendance at district meetings and 
										district conference. Honor our legacy by 
										living the Four Way Test. Honor our 
										legacy by helping build the future with 
										action and vision. Honor our legacy and 
										show the world that District 6580 
										Rotarians care by attending the 1998 
										international convention in 
										Indianapolis. See you there!!<br>
