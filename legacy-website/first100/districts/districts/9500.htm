	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">Rotary started in South Australia 
		with the formation of the Rotary Club of Adelaide on the 24th August 
		1923 and the official recognition by Charter on the 4th February 1924. 
		At this time there were only four other Clubs in Australia, Melbourne, 
		Sydney, Brisbane and Newcastle.<br><br>The then International 
		Association of Rotary Clubs, soon to become Rotary International, 
		appointed two Extension Commissioners, Professor Osborne of the Rotary 
		Club of Melbourne, to foster the growth of Rotary in the Southern States 
		of Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia and Sir 
		Henry Braddon of the Rotary Club of Sydney for New South Wales and 
		Queensland.<br><br>Although there were “unofficial” Conferences held for 
		the Clubs in 1926 and 1927 there was no District in Australia until the 
		15th September 1927 when District 65 was formed for the whole of 
		Australia, which then had 17 Clubs. The first District Governor was Fred 
		Birks (Drugs Retailing) of the Rotary Club of Sydney and he served two 
		years.<br><br>Over the years, new Districts have been formed from the 
		original District 65, as the number of Clubs increased. As far as our 
		District 9500 is concerned, we have been a part of Districts 64, 33, 250 
		and 950 in its evolution. Major changes to the District have occurred in 
		1946, 1951, 1956 and 1977. The 1950s saw our District grow from 31 Clubs 
		in July 1954 to 51 Clubs in May 1960. During this period of rapid 
		expansion it is interesting to note that the District Attendance records 
		reveal monthly average attendances around the 83-84% mark. Early South 
		Australian Clubs, apart from Adelaide, were Mount Gambier 1928, Unley 
		1935, Port Adelaide 1946, Victor Harbor 1947 and Port Lincoln 1949.<br>
		<br>On the 1st July 1977 the large District 250 was divided into 
		Districts 950 and 952, with District 950 consisting of the major western 
		part of South Australia including Adelaide and Alice Springs/Yulara plus 
		Kangaroo Island, whilst District 952 consisted of the remaining eastern 
		part of South Australia, and south of Adelaide plus the Riverland, 
		Riverina and Broken Hill. In 2008, our eastern boundary of District 9500 
		with District 9520 was consolidated to longitude 139o 21’E down to the 
		Walker Flat to Mt Pleasant Road, then following the road &amp; River Torrens 
		to just east then south of Adelaide. (See full Boundary Description on 
		Page 3 ).<br><br>The late Jack Turner from the Rotary Club of Adelaide 
		West, became the first District Governor of District 950, when there 
		were 32 Clubs and 1505 members. His District Conference was held at 
		Kadina. A re-numbering brought into existence the present District 9500 
		on the 1st July 1991, when there were 51 Clubs and approximately 1870 
		members.<br><br>In recent times two Rotary Clubs, Makin EDGE Tea Tree 
		Gully and Roxby District have been Chartered, as well as the Rotaract 
		Club for Global Peace at the Thebarton Senior College and the Rotaract 
		Club of Adelaide University. The Interact Club at the Adelaide High 
		School, which was chartered in the mid 1960s, through the RC of 
		Adelaide, is still an active and busy Club.<br><br>Colin Brideson -

		District 9500 embraces most of South Australia and half of the Northern 
		Territory. It covers 1,700,000 square kilometres and stretches from the 
		Southern Ocean, Kangaroo Island and Adelaide in the south to beyond 
		Alice Springs in the north, extending to the Western Australia/South 
		Australia border in the west. (See full Boundary Description on Page 3 
		).<br><br>South Australia's population is 1.3 million, of which 800,000 
		live in the area covered by District 9500. Currently there are about 
		1450 Rotarians in 51 Clubs. Most of the population live in a narrow 
		coastal belt including near the Capital city, Adelaide (population 
		1,000,000). The other part of South Australia is largely covered by our 
		neighbouring District, District 9520. The economy of South Australia is 
		centred on industry, commerce, sheep, wheat, cattle, wine, fruit, 
		fishing and tourism. The southern half of the Northern Territory relies 
		on tourism and cattle.<br><br>The District is predominantly semi-arid or 
		arid with spectacular scenery - Ayers Rock (Uluru), wild flowers in 
		profusion after rains, an abundance of native animals and birds, and 
		extensive saltbush grazing lands. The population is sparse and tourism 
		is important to the District’s economy.<br><br>District 9500 is the home 
		of the longest straight line of railway in the world (478 km) and 
		contains the largest lead smelter in the world. The opal fields of 
		Coober Pedy produce some of the world’s best opals. The great white 
		shark roams South Australia’s waters and the tuna and lobster industries 
		are an important export commodity.<br><br>Rotary Districts of Australia,
