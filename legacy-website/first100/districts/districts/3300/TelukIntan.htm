		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19"  width: 50%>The Rotary Club of 
		Penang was the first Rotary Club to be organized in Malay Peninsula and 
		Siam on 12th August 1929. (it was the first town visited by Davidson on 
		his southerly journey down the Malay Peninsula.<br><br>At the 
		Inauguration Dinner held at the E&amp;O Hotel, Rtn Percy M. Robinson was 
		installed the Charter President and Rtn. C.W.A. Sennett the Charter 
		Secretary.<br><br>However, it was not until 8th October 1930 that we 
		received the Charter and were admitted to Rotary International.<br><br>There 
		were 71 chartered members – among whom were famous names such as -
		Lim Cheng Ean, Dr K Mohd Ariff, Dr J.W. Scharff, C.R. Samuel, Dr Lee 
		Tiang Keng, F.H. Grumitt and Dr Ong Chong Keng to name a few Past 
		Presidents.<br><br>During the Japanese Occupation 1942-46 the Club 
		ceased functioning.<br><br>The Rotary Club of Penang was re-admitted into 
		Rotary International on 23rd October 1946.<br><br>Penang was the venue 
		of five Conferences and one Asia Zone Institute.<br><br>We were host to the 
		First Asia Regional Conference in 1937-38.<br><br>The first District 
		Conference to be held in Penang was in 1939 when Rtn. Charles R Samuel 
		was District Governor.<br><br>It was a lapse of thirty years before two 
		more District Conferences were held here at which time Rtn. Dr C H Yeang 
		became District Governor in 1969; and four years later Rtn William Ng 
		Jit Thye was elected District Governor in 1973.<br><br>It was again a 
		lapse of twenty long years that Rtn. Herbert J Ho Jr was elected 
		Governor in 1993 before we hosted another conference.<br><br>In 1994 
		Asia Zone 4 Institute hosted by District 3300, was held in Penang on 
		December 8-10 with resounding success.<br><br>Comprising some 12 countries 
		in Asia with diverse cultures, languages, historical background and 
		different economic developments levels had made Asia Zone 4 a most 
		unique, vibrant and exciting one in the Rotary World.<br><br>(Note: Asia 
		Zone 4 was rezoned soon after this Institute).<br><br>In 1995 another 
		District Conference – the fourth, was held when Rtn Dr Santokh Singh was 
		elected Governor.<br><br>The Rotary Club of Penang has had the honour of 
		sponsoring several Rotary, Rotaract and Interact clubs.<br><br>The five 
		Rotary clubs it sponsored are Rotary Clubs of Kota Bahru (1954); Bukit 
		Mertajam (since renamed Butterworth (1959); Bagan Baru (since renamed 
		Georgetown (1983); Tanjung Bungah (1988) and Seberang Jaya (1994).<br>
		<br>The Interact clubs sponsored are Interact Clubs of Chung Ling High 
		School, Methodist Girls School, Technical Institute, Penang Free School, 
		Sri Pinang, Sek. Abdullah Munshi, Westlands and Han Chiang High School.<br><br>
		The only Rotaract club sponsored by the Club is the Rotaract Club of 
		Georgetown (Penang).<br><br>Our community and service projects over the 
		past 75 years are too numerous to detail.<br>Our legacy of major ongoing 
		projects have been supplied under “Ongoing Projects” in our website.<br><br>
		The club continues to address local, national and international service 
		needs incessantly, either using our own resources or joining up with 
		other clubs and agencies to render the needed services.<br><br>In the 
		Club’s archives are two publications, namely the 60th Anniversary Year 
		Book and the 70th Anniversary Year Book that records our historical 
		events, activities and achievements over the last 70 years of service.<br><br>
		These invaluable publications will inspire our members to greater 
		heights of service achievements in this Second Century of Rotary 
		Service.<br><br>ROTARY CLUB OF TELUK INTAN<br><br>The Rotary Club of Teluk 
		Intan was chartered on 11 August 1952 as the Rotary Club of Teluk Anson, 
		Federation of Malaya, under Rotary International District 46.<br><br>
		There were 25 charter members and the Charter President was Dr. Ibrahim 
		bin Haji Mohd. Yassin, a dental officer with the Infant Welfare Centre, 
		Teluk Anson.<br><br>The club meetings were held at 1pm on Tuesdays, at the 
		local Rest House.<br><br>On the 3rd Tuesday of every month, there was a 
		Dinner meeting at 8pm. The admission fee was M$20 and the annual 
		membership fee was M$48.<br><br>The Sponsor Club was the Rotary Club of 
		Ipoh and the District Governor’s Special Representative was its 
		President Leong Min On.<br><br>The District Governor at that time was Khoo 
		Teik Ee. <br><br>In 1952, Teluk Anson, as the town was then called, had 
		a population of 22,961.<br><br>The Rotary Club was first organized on 4 
		March 1952. The club president applied for membership in Rotary 
		International on 20 May 1952 and, in his recommendation to Rotary 
		International on 7 June 1952, the then District Governor of R.I. 
		District 46, Eusoff, wrote:<br><br>The prospect of a Rotary Club was 
		examined as early as 1951 during the Presidentship of H. Wakefiled of 
		the Rotary Club of Ipoh. An extension survey was carried out by 
		President Leong Min On; he was assisted by H. Haines a Past District 
		Governor (in China) now a member of the Rotary Club of Ipoh.<br><br>The 
		inaugural meeting was attended by seven members of the Ipoh Club. I 
		visited this Provisional (Club) on two occasions --- on the last one, I 
		conducted a Club Forum.<br>Teluk Anson is the Chief Port for the State 
		of Perak and in a very important rubber planting it is about 70 miles 
		from Ipoh. {sic}<br><br>Charter Members<br>Names Classifications.<br>1.
