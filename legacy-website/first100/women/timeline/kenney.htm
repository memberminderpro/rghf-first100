		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">1906: First constitution adopted 
		by Rotary made no reference to gender, referring only to “persons”. No 
		one planned on women members.<br><br>1910: At this first Rotary 
		Convention in Chicago, some delegates made the first attempt to 
		officially sanction “Women’s Auxiliaries”. It was rejected 
		overwhelmingly.<br><br>1911-1917: Women formed clubs based on 
		the Rotary Club concept in Minneapolis, led by Dr. Gertrude Stanton, an 
		optometrist and in Duluth, MN, led by Irene Buell, the first woman 
		attorney in Duluth.<br><br>1912: Belfast, Dublin, London and 
		Manchester Rotary boards discuss whether to elect to allow women members 
		or to allow them to attend luncheons. They decide against both.<br><br>
		At the Rotary Convention in Duluth when the International Association of 
		Rotary Clubs was formed, some women attended as delegates and Ida Buell 
		spoke to the convention seeking support for women’s clubs. The idea was 
		rejected.<br><br>1914-1915 and beyond: RI Boards continued to 
		vote their disapproval of Women’s Auxiliaries. This was all, of course, 
		normal for the times when women did not even have the right to vote.<br>
		<br>1914: On a special train bound for the RI Convention in 
		Houston, Rotarian Henry Brunier’s wife Ann was the only woman on board. 
		Rotarians started calling her “Rotary Ann”. The train was met by Guy and 
		Ann Gundaker. The term “Rotary Ann” stuck.<br><br>1921: Four 
		pioneering women led by Alwilda Harvey, wife of the Chicago Club 
		President, convened a luncheon meeting of 59 women and formed the 
		“Chicago Women of Rotary”. RI refused to allow them to use the name 
		“Rotary” and they ignored them and membership grew to 250 members.<br><br>1923: The new movement was chartered in Illinois as a 
		non-profit Corporation. RI insisted the name be changed to “The Women of 
		the Rotary Club of Chicago.”<br><br>RI released a supplement to their 
		1920 “Manuel of Procedure” at the RI Convention in Scotland which 
		included a formal prohibition on women members of Rotary, or women’s 
		clubs that used the Rotary name. It did, however, finally permit a 
		“ladies Auxiliary”.<br><br>1921: The Bristol Venture Club in 
		England formed as a Rotary Club for women. By 1923 they had 151 members. 
		Venture Clubs eventually merged in 1930 with the Soroptimists, which had 
		formed in 1921 in Oakland, CA.<br><br>1924: British wives formed 
		“Inner Wheel” led by Mrs. Margrette Golding, a nurse. Inner Wheel is one 
		of the largest women’s service organizations in the world with over 
		100,000 members in 100 countries.<br><br>1928: The first Rotary 
		Ann Auxiliary was formed in Oklahoma City. This term is still used in 
		parts of the world today.<br><br>1935: Paul Harris wrote in his 
		book “The Rotarian Age”, “I hope that the organizations of the Rotary 
		type now in existence will increase until the time arrives when there 
		will be clubs for all business and professional men and women and youths 
		who are imbued with the ideal of service.”<br><br>1949: At the 
		Salmon Idaho Club, Edwina Nicholls attended Rotary for many years after 
		taking over her deceased husband’s Ford dealership. She was the first 
		woman car dealer in the U.S. Her daughter’s son, Jack Selway, started 
		RGHF.<br><br>1949: The Rotary Foundation began admitting women 
		as Ambassadorial Scholarship recipients.<br><br>1950-1977: A 
		number of unsuccessful attempts were made to provide for the admission 
		of women in Rotary. A proposal to allow women as honorary members was 
		also rejected.<br><br>1976: The Duarte Rotary Club in southern 
		California, a club of 8 members, voted to invite 3 women (Donna Bogart, 
		Mary Lou Elliot and Rosemary Freitag) to join. Rotary DG Paul Bryan, 
		advised the club to list the women with only their initials for their 
		first names. RI accepted the new members.<br><br>1977: The 
		Duarte Club held its 25th Anniversary celebration, which included RI 
		officials. Front and center were the 3 women. The reaction of RI was 
		predictable.<br><br>1978: On March 27, the Duarte Rotary Club’s 
		charter was terminated because they refused to terminate membership of 
		the women. Duarte renamed itself the “EX-Rotary Club of Duarte” and they 
		had Rotary pins made with an X through them.<br><br>The Club continued 
		their efforts to get women recognized as Rotary members through official 
		channels and even sent a representative to the 1978 RI Council on 
		Legislation in Japan. The matter on whether the Duarte Club had violated 
		the RI bi-laws was put to a vote and was a resounding yes by 1060 to 34.<br><br>1978: In June, the Duarte Rotary club filed suit in Los 
		Angeles Superior Court.<br><br>1983: Judge Max Deutz ruled 
		against the Duarte Club.<br><br>1986: On Sept. 16, 1986, the 
		Appeals Court in California stated: “the state’s ban against sex 
		discrimination by a “business establishment” applies to Rotary Clubs 
		subject to regulation under the state’s Unruh Act.” It thus barred RI 
		from revoking the charter of the Rotary Club of Duarte for admitting 
		women members in 1976. Women were allowed to join Rotary Clubs in 
		California. On June 30, 1987, Duarte’s charter was returned and 
		backdated to Sept. 16, 1986. In 1986, following this ruling, RI appeals 
		the case to the California Supreme Court who refuses to hear the case. 
		RI then appeals the decision to the Supreme Court.<br><br>1986: 
		In the Fall, the Seattle International Club (chartered in 1984) inducted 
		15 women into their club known as the “Seattle 15” and filed a lawsuit 
		against RI in the Federal District Court in Seattle, petitioning the 
		court to enjoin RI from revoking their charter. They also file a brief 
		in the Durate Case.<br><br>1987: The January issue of The 
		Rotarian Magazine addresses the question: “Do Women Belong in Rotary?” 
		Every Rotarian was ask to write to RI and express feelings in the 
		matter.<br><br>1987: RI took their fight all the way to the 
		Supreme Court. On May 4, the Supreme Court affirmed the 1986 ruling of 
		the Court of Appeals of California in a 7-0 opinion. Two justices 
		abstained: Sandra Day O’Connor whose husband was a Rotarian and Harry 
		Blackman, an Honorary Rotarian. The ruling affected most service 
		organizations including Kiwanis and Lions Clubs.<br><br>1987: 
		Following the Supreme Court ruling, a California DG in his comments at a 
		Rotary District session stated: “This is a case of the mouse that 
		roared”. The Duarte Club adopted this as their motto.<br><br>
		1987-88: On July 1, Sylvia Whitlock became the first woman president of 
		a Rotary Club- the Duarte Club. Sylvia attended PETS in Feb. prior to 
		assuming office with 290 men in attendance. She was ask: “Is food any 
		better now that women are in Rotary?” and her response was: “No, because 
		we’re not cooking!”<br><br>1989: At the Rotary Council on 
		Legislation, RI voted to open up membership to women throughout Rotary.<br>
		<br>1995: On July 1, eight eligible women took office as 
		Rotary’s first women District Governors. They included: Janet Holland, 
		Mimi Altman, Anne Robertson, Donna Rapp, Gilda Chirafisi, Olive Scott, 
		Virginia Nordby and Reba Lovrien. All are living and active in Rotary 
		except for Mimi Altman. Her daughter by the same name is active 
		presently in Rotary.<br><br>1997: PDG Gilda Chirafisi from 
		District 7230 becomes the first woman in RI to serve as a club President 
		twice at the Riverdale, NY Club.<br><br>1998: In January, PDG 
		Virginia Nordby becomes the first woman delegate to the RI Council on 
		Legislation in India.<br><br>1998: Dr. Catherine Hamlin receives 
		RI’s highest honor, the Rotary Award for World Understanding.<br><br>2005- 2007: On July 1, 2005, Carolyn Jones, PDG District 5010 in 
		Alaska, became the first woman trustee of the Rotary Foundation.<br><br>2008-10: Anne Mathews from South Carolina became the second 
		woman trustee of the Foundation.<br><br>2008-10: Catherine 
		Noyer-Riveau, a physician from France became the first woman Director of 
		RI.<br><br>2012-13: Nan McCreadie took over as the first woman 
		President of RIBI (Rotary International of Great Britain and Ireland).<br>
		<br>2011-13: Elizabeth Demaray from Michigan became a Director 
		of RI. <br><br>2012-13: Elizabeth Demaray became the first woman 
		elected Treasurer of RI. She died in 2012 and never completed her term.<br>
		<br>2012-14: Anne Mathews and Ann Britt Asebol, from Sweden, 
		became Directors of RI<br><br>2013-15: Celia De Giay from 
		Argentina and Mary Ann Growney-Selene from Wisconsin became Directors<br>
		<br>2013-14: Anne Mathews from South Carolina became the first
