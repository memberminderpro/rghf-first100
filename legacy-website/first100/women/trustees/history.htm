	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">It is for me a great honor to do 
		breakfast today with Zones 27, 28, 31 and 32. In fact, if the rezoning 
		effort continues under the current plan, I expect – as a member of Zone 
		24 -- to be breaking bread with some of you for many years into the 
		future.<br><br>I thank my friend, RI Vice President Mike McGovern for 
		inviting me. He usually has to dangle Maine lobster in front of me in 
		order to get me to speak but I am making an exception in this case.<br>
		<br>The best way to tell this story is to first tell you a little bit 
		about myself. This presents a serious problem because my mother taught 
		me not to talk about myself. So, I will try to strike a balance in such 
		a way as not to disappoint my mother and not to disappoint you.<br><br>
		In 1939 my mother and father were riding together on his motorcycle. It 
		was a dark and wet night. My uncle and his wife were following closely 
		in a car. My uncle drove too fast over the crest of a hill and slammed 
		into the back of the motor cycle, throwing my mother some 7 meters into 
		the air. It took a year of hospital visits to patch up my mother and put 
		the pieces back together. The doctors said she would never have 
		children.<br><br>I was born on January 9, 1941. I don’t mean to make 
		myself seem self-important but I have always thought that my being here 
		is a miracle birth and I have spent the rest of my life trying to figure 
		out why I am here and trying not to waste the miracle.<br><br>Who is 
		this miracle baby called Carolyn? I grew up: colored – black – 
		African-American. I don’t know who made these decisions about what to 
		call me. I know I never got a vote. But it was always about skin color. 
		Sometimes, my life was better because of this issue. Most of the time it 
		was not.<br><br>I remember one grammar school teacher encouraging me to 
		do my best in school and that I did not need to end my life cleaning 
		some other lady’s home. And I benefited when Stanford University decided 
		to actively seek qualified blacks to add to its student body. Stanford 
		did not make any special exceptions for people like me. Stanford merely 
		made sure that we knew that we were welcome.<br><br>But more often, we 
		were packing our lunches in a shoe box when we took a road trip because 
		we were not sure if a restaurant would serve us. And in my town, people 
		were only of 2 colors and people of my color lived below the main street 
		while the other color lived above it.<br><br>So, until I went off to law 
		school, I lived my life as a colored/black/African-American minority. 
		Whenever anything happened to me that was unfair, I thought it was 
		because of the color of my skin.<br><br>It was only when I went to Yale 
		Law School that I learned I was a double minority. One day, I sought 
		support and advice from one of my favorite law school professor. He said 
		that getting the top grade, an “A”, was not enough. As a woman, I would 
		have to be even better.<br><br>When I graduated from law school, all my 
		classmates were accepting job offers to be lawyers in law firms. My 
		first job offer was to be a legal secretary with the opportunity to work 
		my way up to the level of a lawyer in the firm.<br><br>Once I graduated 
		from law school, I went to Trieste, Italy where I lived and worked for a 
		year and a half as an interpreter and translator. The people in Trieste 
		had never before seen or known anyone of color. My life there reminds me 
		of the American television comedy, “Cheers” where everybody knew my 
		name. <br><br>After a year and a half out of the country, I came home 
		because – at the end of the day – I am an American. America is my home.<br>
		<br>I worked several years providing legal services for the poor in 
		northern California. Then I finally moved to Alaska to serve in the 
		Alaska Attorney General’s Office for 23 years.<br><br>It was in Alaska 
		that my legal life intersected with Rotary International. <br><br>Rotary 
		International is “an organization of business and professional men 
		united worldwide who provide humanitarian service, encourage high 
		ethical standards in all vocations, and help build good will and peace 
		in the world. “ So stated the Rotary Manual of Procedure in 1981. The 
		General Secretary defended this provision with the explanation “that the 
		exclusion of women results in an “aspect of fellowship … that is enjoyed 
		by the present male membership” and also allows RI to operate 
		effectively in foreign countries with varied cultures and social mores.
		<br><br>Although women were not admitted to membership until 1987, they 
		were permitted to attend meetings, give speeches, and receive awards. 
		Women relatives of Rotary members could form their own associations and 
		were authorized to wear the Rotary lapel pin. Young women between 14 and 
		28 years of age could join Interact or Rotaract, organizations sponsored 
		by Rotary International, as well as study abroad under the 
		organization’s youth exchange program. <br><br>It was 4 May 1987 when 
		the highest court in the United States handed down a decision that 
		affected the application of a law of the State of California and the 
		decision was limited to the State of California. The court decided that 
		in the state of California, women could not be excluded from membership 
		in Rotary solely because of their gender. [The RI Board had earlier 
		decided that if they lost the California case, they would concede the 
		U.S., rather than endure the costly expense of litigation in the 
		remaining 49 states. Rotarians in the other 49 states immediately 
		assumed that they could invite women to join in their states as well.]<br>
		<br>Just one day after the Supreme Court decision, a Rotarian phoned to 
		invite me to lunch at his club on Wednesday. I said “thank you” but “no 
		thank you.” I said: “Manuel, I am in my 40s. For years, I have carried 
		the torch and led the way for various causes. It is someone else’s turn. 
		I am not interested in going where I am not welcome.”<br><br>The 
		following Tuesday, Manuel phoned again to invite me to lunch on 
		Wednesday. Manuel phoned 5 Tuesdays in a row. It became clear that 
		Manuel was not going to stop phoning me and inviting me until I finally 
		went to lunch at his Rotary club.<br><br>I went to lunch. The first 2 
		men I saw when I crossed under the threshold were 2 men that I knew in 
		my regular life in Anchorage. They looked; they smiled; they greeted me. 
		It was spontaneous. I knew that I was welcome. <br><br>I went back for 
		more lunches. And the rest, as they say, is history.<br><br>But while 
		the Rotary Club of Anchorage East was making me welcome, Rotarians in 
		other parts of the world were in anguish over this change. And they made 
		their opinions clear in their letters to the Rotarian magazine. Here are 
		just a few samples:<br><br>From India: In … countries, like India, 
		because of their culture – many women remain as housewives and very few 
		can join. Because of their small numbers it will be difficult to give 
		them proper representation on boards and committees. … Rotary has not 
		shut the door to women. They are always welcome as Rotarians’ wives, and 
		as such participate in almost all our projects.<br><br>A Rotarian from 
		England wrote: In regard to the recent US decision “permitting women to 
		become members of Rotary clubs … It was more “forcing” upon Rotary clubs 
		in some states.<br><br>The man from Canada said: This seems like a bad 
		dream. If the majority chooses to continue present membership policy 
		that is the way it should be.<br><br>The news from Nigeria was no 
		different: The [real] issue is the collective right of men to freedom of 
		association. … I am afraid that the Western world is carrying equal 
		rights for women too far. <br><br>The Portuguese Rotarian weighed in: 
		For a long time our wives have been collaborating with the Rotary 
		movement. The place for Women and Rotary is in Inner Wheel or in a 
		similar organization!<br><br>From Denmark: In my opinion, it is 
		dangerous to allow women to join. ... The situation is not yet mature 
		enough for such an important change.<br><br>Wrote a New Zealander: I 
		like to have the comfort of a men’s club because I would simply hate to 
		see women forced on me or us. <br><br>Every 3 years, Rotary’s 
		legislative body, the Council on Legislation meets. In earlier meetings, 
		the Council had several times voted down the idea of admitting women to 
		Rotary membership. This changed in January 1989 when the Council met in 
		Singapore and adopted an amendment to the Rotary constitution that would 
		permit any Rotary club worldwide to admit women into membership. To 
		amend Rotary’s constitutional documents requires a 2/3rds majority vote. 
		At that meeting, 328 delegates or 73.7%, voted in favor of deleting the 
		word “male” from the constitutional documents.<br><br>Prior to the 
		Council decision only Rotary clubs in the U.S. and Canada could admit 
		women members. By the time of the Council’s vote there were an estimated 
		10,800 Women and Rotary in those 2 countries.<br><br>In less than a year 
		after the Council’s vote, women were members of Rotary clubs in 33 
		countries and territories, representing 5,000+ clubs in 239 districts. 
		Women were Rotarians in such diverse countries as: Australia, 
		Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, 
		Mexico, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.<br><br>Within 5 more years, the 
		first 8 women were taking their places to serve as governors for the 
		year 1995-96. 5 of the original 8 were from the zones represented at 
		this breakfast: Donna Rapp, Mimi Altman, Virginia Nordby, Olive P. Scott 
		and Gilda R. Chirafisi.<br><br>Now with 20 years of membership 
		(1987-2007), Women and Rotary account for approximately 178,050 
		Rotarians – 14.54% of the total membership. At the International 
		Assembly in January 2008, there were 65 women DGEs from 24 nations, 
		including Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Iceland, India, Nigeria, Rumania, 
		Slovakia, and Venezuela.<br><br>Once women completed their service as 
		governors, they were eligible to be considered for appointment as 
		international training leaders – a select group of about 40 PDGs who 
		prepare the next incoming class of DGEs. The first 2 women to receive 
		this assignment –1 from Florida and 1 from Alaska -- were appointed in 
		2000, within 5 years after the first women had served as governors. Over 
		the past 8 years, those numbers have reached a high of 10 female 
		training leaders, or 25% of the entire leadership class.<br><br>Women 
		have held numerous responsible positions at the zone level and have more 
		than once chaired the committee organizing a zone institute – Rotary’s 
		annual meeting of past officers. At the RI level, women have chaired the 
		membership development and retention committee, the public image 
		committee, the sergeant-at-arms committee and more. Finally, in 2005, a 
		woman was appointed to a 4-year term as one of the 15 Trustees of the 
		Rotary Foundation. And, on 1 July 2008, the first female member of the 
		RI Board of Directors will take office. Interestingly, the new director 
		is from France – one of the Rotary nations most staunchly opposed to 
		having Women and Rotary when the California case was being litigated.<br>
		<br>I remember a Rotary youth exchange student from Australia telling me 
		in 1995, that the men of Australia would never ever let women join 
		Rotary. Yet, I personally know several female Rotarians in Australia; 
		several past governors; and several past and present international 
		training leaders. <br><br>I remember a Rotarian from Great Britain 
		telling me that women would never be Rotarians in his part of the world, 
		and that the governor was not even permitted to bring his spouse to the 
		club meetings when he made his official visits. Yet, I have personally 
		met three female governors from England and this year one of the 
		training leaders was from England. <br><br>Reportedly, Japan has long 
		resisted permitting women to join their Rotary clubs. But, in 2007, I 
		personally shook the hand of a female DGE who arrived in San Diego for 
		her training. <br><br>The charter president of the Rotary club of Kabul, 
		Afghanistan was a woman. I could give countless examples. <br><br>Sylvia 
		Whitlock, the first female president of a Rotary club said: “Just the 
		face of Rotary has changed. But Rotary’s commitment to service has not 
		changed. – and that’s why we join, because we want to serve.”<br><br>
		Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of a former U.S. president, once said: “The 
		future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.”<br>
		<br>Our incoming RI President D. K. Lee has selected as his theme: “Make 
		Dreams Real”<br><br>Sometimes dreams are really what life is all about. 
		This little piece of Rotary Global History that I have related tonight 
		is about living the dream.<br><br>I cannot declare that we live in a 
		perfect Rotary world where women are embraced in every corner of the 
		world but I can say with absolute certainty that change is in the air 
		and it is happening everywhere. And I look forward to the day when I 
		will no longer be asked to give this speech about “Women and Rotary.” I 
		look forward to the day when we will all just be Rotarians.<br><br>Thank 
		you letting me talk to you today about me, about dreams and about 
		Rotary.</td>
