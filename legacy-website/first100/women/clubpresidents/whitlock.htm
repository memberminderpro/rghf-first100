		In 1988 I attended my first International Convention, and discovered,

		club had ever hosted. They saluted my health and the Queen’s on the same 
		glass! <br><br>I have never ceased to marvel at the vast membership 
		group that is Rotary! I have attended about 11 International 
		Conventions, and served my second year as President on this year of our 
		fiftieth anniversary. I have served the district as Chair of the Four 
		Way Test Speech Competition for six years and Chair of the Ambassadorial 
		Scholarship Committee for as many years. Both of these positions have 
		allowed me to see, firsthand, the best there is among our youth and to 
		crystallize the purposes behind our service. Now, as an Assistant 
		Governor, I continue to be involved at district level. <br><br>I am 
		proud to be a member of Rotary. I have met several International

		Thoughts on Rotary and the Duarte club from Sylvia Whitlock, the first 
		woman club president in Rotary International 1987-88. <br><br>August 17, 
		2002<br><br>To www.rghf.org<br><br>In 1982, at the invitation of one of 
		the women whose admission had caused the ouster of the 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/issues-legal/duarte/index.htm">Rotary Club of 
		Duarte</a>, I joined the Ex-Rotary Club of Duarte. Mary Lou Elliott was an 
		elementary school principal, as was I. <br><br>Service clubs were not 
		familiar to me. I had heard of Kiwanis and Elks and even Soroptimists 
		but I had never heard of Rotary. It was described as a group of people 
		whose watchword was “service” - to the community, and to the world. I 
		was excited at the prospect of service to a community in which I did not 
		live, but whose children and parents had become very special. Joining 
		Rotary afforded me the opportunity to meet people who had other 
		professions and who took service seriously. <br><br>Our club then 
		provided assistance to all the schools, to senior citizens in the 
		community and to various charitable organizations. We gave blood 
		regularly to the City of Hope. We participated with the city in their 
		annual community picnic and Route 66 parade. Our snowcone booth is still 
		a hit at the all day picnic and celebration. <br><br>
		<img class="auto-style25" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/clubpresidents/whitlock.jpg" style="float: left">In 
		1987 when the U. S. Supreme Court ruled in our favor, we removed the 
		“Ex” from our title and once again began paying dues to Rotary 
		International. I attended the PETS meeting with almost 300 men and no 
		other women. I did not feel other than welcome, even as our incoming 
		governor opined that this was just a transitory situation. We were going 
		to do the best we could as Rotarians. The ensuing coverage by the media 
		was overwhelming. It was clear we had a responsible job. <br><br>We 
		co-sponsored an orphanage in Tecate, Mexico, and continued for over ten 
		years.<br><br>We participated fully in the PolioPlus Campaign and now 
		have 100 percent of our members as Paul Harris or sustaining members, 
		and several benefactors. </td>

		Whitlock was born in New York City but was educated, through high 
		school, in Kingston, Jamaica. After returning to New York City she 
		earned a B.A. in Psychology from Hunter College. Sylvia worked for the 
		United Nations, as a Statistical Clerk, at the Secretariat Building in 
		New York, before moving to California to start a career in Education. In 
		California she went on to earn a Masters Degree, cum laude, in Education 
		from Cal Poly, Pomona, and a Ph.D., cum laude, in Education, from 
		Claremont Graduate School. Subsequently, she earned another Masters 
		Degree, in Marriage and Family Therapy, from Azusa Pacific University, 
		and began a second career as a therapist. She is licensed by the Board 
		of Behavioral Sciences in California. <br><br>In 1982, while an 
		Elementary School Principal in Duarte, CA., she was invited to join the 
		history-making Ex-Rotary Club of Duarte. Sylvia became President of that 
		club in 1987, the year the United States Supreme Court ruled that the 
		club be reinstated, thus making her the first woman in the Rotary World 
		to head a club as President. She has served as President twice, 
		Secretary, Treasurer, and Foundation Representative. At district level, 
		she chaired the Four Way Test Speech committee for six years, the 
		Ambassadorial Scholarship Committee for six years, receiving a Service 
		Award from DG Don Aikin, and Simplified Grants for two years. She has 
		been an assistant governor, presenter in Governors Institutes, and 
		speaker in Rotary Clubs conventions and meetings, here and overseas, 
		including South Africa, Jamaica, Washington and Texas.<br><br>Other 
		community activities have included being a member of the Board of the 
		Spanish Trails Girl Scout Council, volunteer at Pomona Valley Hospital, 
		Recorder for the Blind and Dyslexic, and Commissioner at TriCity Mental 
		Health Agency. In 2000 she was named Woman of the Year by NAACP and in 
		1998 she was named Distinguished Alumna by Cal Poly, Pomona. She also 
		chairs Western Association of Schools and Colleges accreditation teams 
		and has been, for eight years, a member of the Committee on 
		Credentialing for California State Department of Education. She attends 
		Trinity United Methodist Church where she is often a lay reader.<br><br>
		Sylvia considers Rotary to be the best vehicle she knows for 
		humanitarian ventures in service to mankind. Some favorite club 
		projects, while in Duarte, have included sinking water wells in Nigeria, 
		setting up an AIDS Center in Jamaica and supporting an orphanage in 
		Mexico. She continues to be inspired by the many Rotarians who have 
		taken the organization to the edge of tomorrow and is committed to using 
		the opportunity she has been given to further the cause of Rotary, in 
		her community, in her country, and in the world.<br><br>Sylvia is a 
		multiple Paul Harris Fellow and benefactor. She has three adult children 
		- Meredith - a Paul Harris Fellow, BG is a deputy county counsel in San 
		Mateo County, and Arlan. She considers raising her children the most 
		satisfying and enjoyable job she has ever had.<br><br>WOMEN ALSO SERVE, 
		PDG Sylvia Whitlock, USA. 9 March 2015. ISBN 978-1-4917-6059. iUniverse 
		Publishing<br>The Rotary Club of Duarte, California, was chartered in 
		District 530 in 1952. But just before its twenty-fifth birthday in 1976, 
		the Duarte club violated Rotary's bylaws by inviting women to join, 
		ultimately causing its charter to be unceremoniously revoked by Rotary 
		International. Undeterred, the club renamed itself the Ex-Rotary Club of 
		Duarte and its members continued on their quest not to be outcasts of 
		one of the greatest humanitarian organizations in the world.<br><br>
		Filled with facts and personal anecdotes, the first woman president in 
		Rotary International shares a fascinating glimpse into the journey of 
		the Duarte club. Sylvia Whitlock, who was present as the club enlisted 
		help from the American Civil Liberties Union and took the case through 
		the California court system until a landmark decision in May 1987, 
		details the circumstances of the case as women struggled to attain equal 
		rights, her role in the process, conversations with participants and 
		onlookers, and the benefits she has gained personally through her own 
		membership.<br><br>Women Also Serve shares a compelling history of the 
		Duarte Rotary Club <br>
