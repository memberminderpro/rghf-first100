				<img alt="Tin Tin" height="160" src="images/raschid.jpg" style="float: left" width="111">How 
				and Why Tin Tin Nu Raschid joined Rotary<br><br><br>This is 
				truly a very long story going back more than 59 years, even 
				before I got married. One can even say that I got into Rotary by 
				marriage!. My father-in-law was a Past President of the Rotary 
				Club of Rangoon, Burma ( later became a District Governor in 
				1959-60) and was very active in Rotary.&nbsp; Bilal took me as his 
				date to the Rotary Club of Rangoon's Dinner/Dance. When my 
				father -law- was the District Governor, he was also in U Nu's 
				Government and had to travel. I served as his Aide, taking care 
				of correspondence etc., and learned a lot about Rotary and Inner 
				Wheel.&nbsp; A dozen or so years before Bilal became a Rotarian at 
				age 27, the two of us were already helping the Rotary Club of 
				Rangoon in their programs and fund raisers. We got married in 
				1956, and left Rangoon for Liverpool, UK for further studies. 
				After Bilal's return he started his private practice in 
				architecture, and became a Rotarian in 1962. I remember those 
				days well. Women could not join Rotary; and there was no Inner 
				Wheel Club in Burma. But we helped our spouses in all their 
				Rotary endeavors. (But I was waiting in the wings to become a 
				Rotarian! ). As a 34 year old President's wife, I took charge of 
				the Rotary parties for children, raising funds and providing 
				food and games for the physically challenged children .We held 
				these parties for the children from the orphanages, in which our 
				own children participated, on two acres of the Thai Ambassador's 
				residence in the heart of Rangoon. These were the beginnings of 
				my involvement with Rotary.<br><br>In 1969, we migrated to 
				Pakistan for the future of our three children. We did not know a 
				single person in Pakistan and we had only a total of $ 25.00, 
				which the Burmese military government permitted us to take with 
				us. The next week after his arrival in Karachi, Pakistan, Bilal 
				went to attend a Rotary meeting; and there he found his new 
				&quot;family&quot; and friends. One Rotarian introduced him to one of the 
				leading architectural firms in the city, and that is how he got 
				his first job! Could it be better than this? Please read on.<br>
				<br>While Bilal was waiting for clearance of his Rotary 
				classification to become a member (in those days only two were 
				allowed from each classification), I joined the Inner Wheel club 
				of Karachi ( the only Inner Wheel Club in the entire country in 
				1969). Soon both of us were busy with the activities of Rotary 
				and Inner Wheel. Our Children used to ask whether our house was 
				the headquarters of Rotary International, as we would bring home 
				Rotary work for them to help us with. Bilal formed a new Rotary 
				Club; and I formed three Inner Wheel Clubs, and together we 
				formed the first Rotaract Club of Karachi in 1969. It was the 
				only Rotaract Club in the whole of Pakistan at that time.<br>
				<br>One Rotarian recognized my ability for organizing and public 
				speaking, and made me the Master of ceremonies for the &quot; Ladies 
				Night&quot;. Once a month the Club would change their luncheon 
				meetings to dinner meetings, invite the spouses with a program 
				of interest to the Ladies ( hence, the &quot;Ladies Night&quot;). Another 
				Rotarian recommended me to be the Director of Cultural affairs 
				at the Pakistan American Cultural Center.&nbsp; We got more and more 
				involved with the Rotary and the Community. A couple of years 
				later two other Rotarians recommended me for the position of the 
				Executive Director of Pakistan American Cultural Center. I was 
				the first Woman and the first non-official of the U. S. Embassy 
				to be so appointed. I had charge of six Pakistan American 
				Cultural Centers to start with. A year later I formed the 
				seventh one in Peshawar. The main activity of the Bi-national 
				Center was to teach English as a second language to more than 
				10,000 students learning English and about a couple of hundred 
				students attending Cultural and Vocational Classes. The Centers 
				also promoted American culture to the Pakistanis, and Pakistani 
				culture to the Americans and others. My job took me to different 
				places in Pakistan, and I took the opportunity of forming new 
				Inner Wheel Clubs where ever I could.&nbsp; At one time I was invited 
				to a Rotary meeting to talk about Inner Wheel Clubs. They had 
				invited their spouses to the meeting. We got there on time and 
				to my surprise, I was put in a separate room with the women, and 
				had to address the Rotarians through a curtain!! Nevertheless, 
				to my delight, an Inner wheel Club was formed. Bilal and I 
				visited the refugees from Bangladesh, who had been dumped into a 
				refugee center in the middle of the desert. We distributed 
				goods, clothes, sewing machines, provided sanitation facilities 
				etc. and did whatever we could for them. We, the members of the 
				Inner Wheel Club, also set up a clinic to provide health care 
				and outings for the children with physical disabilities.<br><br>
				After ten happy years in Pakistan, we decided to migrate to US. 
				The two sons were already studying at George Washington 
				University and University of Pennsylvania and the daughter was 
				studying at Cambridge University in UK. Again, we had to start 
				from the bottom. Bilal went to attend a Rotary meeting in 
				Washington DC and an architect member introduced him to the 
				President of one of the most prestigious architectural firms, 
				namely,&nbsp; Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. At that time I had stayed 
				behind in Karachi to sell our house, and attend to other 
				matters. One month after my arrival in Washington, D.C. in 
				February 1970, I bought a very run down florist shop in 
				Arlington, Virginia, and turned it into a successful FTD shop. 
				Well, as you guessed, Rotarians patronized me again. Wherever we 
				go, and whatever we do, the Rotarian friends have always been 
				supportive. The main reason for our continued support for Rotary 
				is because through Rotary one can give back one's thanks to the 
				community and to the Rotarians who have helped us all our lives. 
				We are grateful to all those who touched our lives, specially 
				those Pakistani Rotarians who helped us when we got there almost 
				penny-less. Bilal joined the Rotary Club of Washington DC, and 
				was very active there for almost fifteen years. He moved to the 
				Falls Church Club as his office had moved to Crystal City, VA 
				and it became very time consuming to attend the DC Club. He has 
				33 years of perfect attendance, and wanted to keep it going. <br>
				<br>When some clubs were accepting women, Bilal took me to 
				several Rotary Clubs. I liked&nbsp; the DC as well as the McLean 
				Club. When we got to the McLean Club, we did not know anyone. 
				But I sat next to a Rotarian who had just visited Burma. He 
				sponsored me right away; and in February 1989, I was inducted 
				into the club. It was one of the happiest days of my life. The 
				second happiest and third happiest were when I was asked by the 
				nominating&nbsp; committee to be President, and later, District 
				Governor. I was the first woman President of the Rotary club of 
				McLean in 1992-93; and the first woman Governor of District 7610 
				and of Virginia in 1996-97.<br><br>We, the first women 
				Presidents and District Governors encountered and faced many 
				interesting incidences, some funny and a few very irritating. 
				Initially,&nbsp; we were ignored most of the time, and watched people 
				making a bee line to our husbands. At one District conference 
				where I had gone to represent RI President Glenn Estess, the 
				same thing happened. My husband was mistaken as the RI 
				President's Representative. When he told the local PDG that it 
				was his wife who was the Representative, the old Past&nbsp; District 
				Governor shook his head and said &quot; what has the World come to?&quot;&nbsp; 
				I just pretended not to hear him. At the end of the conference, 
				he came up to me and said &quot;Madam Governor, you did a great job&quot;. 
				One President, during my official visit to his club, said that I 
				can say anything except ask them to get women into the club!. On 
				another occasion, a club ( without any woman members) &quot;borrowed&quot; 
				a woman member from another club to make me feel comfortable 
				during my official visit. Also we had to tread softly so as not 
				to step on any PDG's toes.<br><br>It is not just work all the 
				time with Rotary. I had great fun forming the Fellowship of 
				Rotarian Floral Designers and also Chair the RI Committee on 
				Global Networking Groups.. The six years this Fellowship was in 
				existence, I did most of the work by giving free floral 
				demonstrations in the community, at the clubs, at District 
				Conferences and at the Zone Institutes. I have also chaired the 
				decorations committee for many Zone institutes. On the Floral 
				Fellowships final year ( it folded up as no one wanted to take 
				over as president), five of us gave floral demonstrations and 
				displays every day during the International Convention in 
				Chicago in 2005. My floral arrangements have reached Presidents 
				Reagan, Bush,Sr., Clinton,&nbsp; many Senators, Congressmen, and 
				Chief of Staff, as my second shop was in McLean, VA.&nbsp; I still 
				play with flowers from time to time, as I have a business 
				license to do work under the name of &quot; Rent-a-Florist&quot;. I do 
				wedding and party flowers for those who engage my services. You 
				guessed it right, the Rotarians and Freemasons still continue to 
				patronize me. <br><br>Joining the Rotary Global History 
				Fellowship and serving on its Board have enriched our lives very 
				much and I would like to thank the Founders and&nbsp; the dedicated 
				Board Members. I would also like to encourage others to join the 
				RGHF. Although we have attended 59 District Conferences, 15 
				International Conventions and 15 Zone Institutes and know quite 
				a lot about Rotary, we always refer to the RGHF web pages for 
				detailed information on various aspects of Rotary.<br><br>We 
				both enjoy Rotary and the company of Rotarians, as well as Free 
				Masons. We have given a lot of service to these organizations 
				over the years. Both of us have received Rotary International's 
				highest and most prestigious award, &quot;Service Above Self&quot;. Bilal 
				got his in 1998 (he was our District's&nbsp; first recipient) and I 
				received it in 2006. We are both sustaining Paul Harris Members 
				and Major Donors and there are seven Paul Harris Fellows in our 
				immediate family. But we still wish we could do more for Rotary.<br>
