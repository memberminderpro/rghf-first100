        <img class="auto-style25" height="152" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/firstdgs/holland/d5790header.jpg" style="float: left" width="199">Probably 
		the earliest memories of my life were of Rotary. Of course, I didn't 
		realize what Rotary was at the time. I remember going to a lot of 
		meetings with my parents, where there were a lot of grown-ups, and a lot 
		of the time I was told to behave myself Those memories stayed with me, 
		because it was hard for me to be good! I was four years old when my 
		father, W. Lee Woodward, was Rotary Governor of District 124 (now 
		Districts 5750 and 5790) in Oklahoma. Those must have been the early 
		years I remember. Whenever we traveled, the first thing my mother did 
		was pull the Official Directory out from under the seat of the car where 
		it always stayed. It was a challenge to see how many Rotary clubs my 
		father could attend on each trip. We would speed up, slow down and go 
		out of our way to make a meeting. I didn't realize we were different. I 
		thought all families traveled that way.<br><br>As I was growing up, 
		frequent visitors in our home were men who had been district governors 
		about the same time as my father. Some of them served as RI directors, 
		and one, J. Edd McLaughlin, was RI president in 1960-61. It seemed as 
		though I had always been a Rotarian with so much of my life touched by 
		Rotary. I didn't hesitate when I was asked to join and I was eager to 
		become involved.<br><br>In 1989, I took Hugh Archer's theme &quot;Enjoy 
		Rotary&quot; to heart by joining the international Skiing Fellowship of 
		Rotarians. Those ISFR ski weeks introduced me to Rotarians beyond the 
		district. Two years later, the fellowship decided that we needed to grow 
		and get more Rotarians around the world involved in the ISFR. Because we 
		own a hardware store, they decided that I must know marketing and public 
		relations? so the task of publicity and membership fell to me. Imagine 
		the excitement in our hardware store in rural Texas when I had phone 
		calls from Rotarians in Turkey, New Zealand, and Italy, all in a single 
		day! This was my introduction to the international part of Rotary 
		international. From 1993-95, as president of the Skiing Fellowship, I 
		was the first woman to head an international fellowship. That honor was 
		overshadowed by the honor and pleasure of meeting with then RI President 
		Bob Barth in his Evanston office. At that time I presented to him two 
		official pins of the skiing fellowship making President and Mrs. Barth 
		honorary members of ISFR.<br><br>I was surprised when Rotarians began to 
		ask if I would agree to be nominated for district governor. My response 
		was that Rotarians around the district probably didn't know me well 
		enough. They convinced me that they all m. I had attended a district 
		conference on crutches, a result of my first ski fellowship week. The 
		conference was held on two floors of a resort with no elevator!<br><br>
		My location in the district might have been one of the reasons I was 
		selected to be the nominee. District 5790, in North Central Texas, 
		covers 28,000 square miles and has three major urban areas. The Fort 
		Worth Metroplex area is on the extreme eastern edge of the district. 
		Almost half of our 63 clubs (including the Rotary Club of Fort Worth, 
		with 700 members ) and two-thirds of the 3700 Rotarians in the district 
		are in this area. Wichita Falls is on the north edge. Abilene is in the 
		southwest corner of the district. Because most of the Rotarians are in 
		these three urban centers, the majority of the district governors come 
		from these areas. My club is almost in the exact middle of the district 
		and in a rural area. It had been ten years since a governor was selected 
		from the rural middle of the district.<br><br>Jumping from running a 
		hardware store, with all its nuts and bolts, plumbing supplies, paint, 
		etc., to the international Assembly was going to another world. That 
		week in Anaheim was an unbelievable experience. We made friends 
		instantly, talked to and really got to know people from around the 
		world, shared the common interest in Rotary, planned joint projects, and 
		discussed new ideas in the breakout sessions. How can you explain to 
		anyone who has not been there, what it means and how it changes your 
		life? Having the opportunity to participate in that one week was worth 
		all the work and time spent preparing for and being district governor. I 
		would do it all again for that week's experience in Anaheim.<br><br>I 
		had wondered how we, the women governors, would be received by the other 
		governors, especially those from outside the USA. One of my fondest 
		Anaheim memories was of a governor nominee from Thailand. He left no 
		doubt in our minds how welcome we were. When I met him one day in the 
		lobby, he was so disappointed that he hadn't brought his camera. He 
		wanted his picture taken with one of the women nominees. The next day we 
		saw each other at the same time and place in the lobby as though it were 
		planned. He had his camera and he was very pleased to see me again. As 
		we were posing for the picture, I looked up and saw another woman 
		nominee getting out of the elevator, then another. By the time the 
		picture was taken, he had two women nominees on each side of him. Four 
		of us surrounding the Thai nominee! I've often wondered how many people 
		have seen that picture. It was always<br><br>an honor to be asked to 
		pose for a picture. Everywhere we went, people wanted pictures of the 
		first women nominees and a chance to get to know us.<br><br>We had to 
		forget the celebrity status when the time for classes continued. We 
		became just another nominee in a group of about twenty nominees, 
		learning more about Rotary through the discussion groups. These groups 
		gave us additional opportunities to interact with each other and learn 
		of Rotary activities in other regions. We realized how much Rotary 
		varies from area to area. But, men or women, with all our differences, 
		we're the same, because we are Rotarians.<br><br>Looking back at the 
		year I spent preparing to be governor, it seems like a blur. At the 
		time, I thought I was very well organized. I had told our daughter, 
		Michele, and our son, Daniel, that they could marry any time they 
		wanted, except from January, 1995 until July, 1996, when my time would 
		be filled with preparing for and being governor. That was my mistake. I 
		should never have mentioned marriage. Both of them, ages 29 and 27, 
		decided to marry and their weddings would be during the first two months 
		of my year as district governor. Our daughter was in a doctoral program 
		in west Texas but wanted to marry in her home church and have the 
		reception at home, so l did most of the work after she made the 
		decisions about her wedding. RI President Herb Brown was stressing the 
		importance of family, so l put my family first and didn't start my club 
		visits until July 18th, three days after her wedding. Daniel's wedding 
		was in August. Although I was not as involved, it was still a very busy 
		time juggling the wedding activities with my Rotary responsibilities.<br>
		<br>In addition to the week in Anaheim, some of my best memories of the 
		year are of the club visits. During the second week of my visits, 
		Arlington Sunrise Rotarians took me to see some of their club projects, 
		including playground equipment they and the community had built when 
		they were a very young club. When we returned to my hotel, I was 
		speechless when I looked up and saw the marquee &quot;Welcome Rotary District 
		Governor Janet Holland&quot;. it suddenly struck me that I was IT! I really 
		was &quot;GOVERNOR.&quot; After a year and a half of preparation, the time had 
		come.<br><br>Nothing in my training prepared me for the third week of 
		the visits. That week, I would be in one of the least populated areas 
		with small clubs and towns with one exception, Vernon. Since I hadn't 
		heard from the first club and they hadn't returned my calls, I finally 
		called an old time Rotarian in the club. He told me that they had 
		disbanded. To learn of losing a 75 year old club during the third week 
		of the club visits was very disheartening. But I told myself, &quot;Chin up, 
		Janet, and on to Vernon&quot;, a club of 55 men. The only thing they would 
		talk about at the club assembly was how to get women members and not 
		lose the members they had. Whatever we were discussing, women members 
		came up again. In closing, I told them I would come I back to induct 
		their first woman member. A month later they called me to come induct 
		their first five women and also five men! It was raining very hard that 
		first morning I was in Vernon. By the time I left town, it was pouring. 
		As I crossed a stream, water was running over the bridge. Looking in my 
		rear view mirror, I saw the highway department crews closing the bridge. 
		Five minutes later and I would have had a five hour detour into Oklahoma 
		to get back to my next stop, Crowell. Before it stopped, it had rained 
		over 25 inches in the two days I was in the area.<br><br>In Crowell, I 
		was staying with a couple, both Rotarians, twenty-four miles in the 
		country. Just as we were leaving for the assembly, they learned that 
		their club president had resigned that day and had already left town. By 
		the time we got to town they had decided that she would serve a second 
		term as president, in addition to being my governor's representative. 
		The Rotarians in town had already made the same decision. The fourth 
		club of the week continued the pattern. I hadn't heard about the 
		arrangements so l started calling. After several calls, I learned that 
		their president had left his job and moved away. Apparently he hadn't 
		told anyone I was coming. The secretary said he would make reservations 
		for my room but he couldn't remember the name of the motel and would 
		call back. When he called, the motel was the same name as the town! 
		Their new president of this 15 member club had been a Rotarian for only 
		nine months, so the assembly became a mini PETs for all the members. 
		After that week, I couldn't wait to see what else was in store for me 
		during my visits.&nbsp;</td>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19" style="width: 50%">My husband, 
		Mike, is a rancher and couldn't go with me on my club visits. He asked 
		what I would do if my car broke down. My answer was that I had 3,700 
		Rotarians out there who were to take good care of me. During the fourth 
		week, I needed their help. My car died as I was crossing a long bridge 
		out in the country. I managed to coast to the end of the bridge and into 
		a parking lot of a building under construction. There was not another 
		building or car in sight for miles. I walked around the building looking 
		for some workers and found a boat rental business and sales office in 
		the back. They had a mechanic on duty who could fix my car but it would 
		take a few days to get the parts. Through the help of the closest Rotary 
		club, I soon had a rental car reserved and chauffeur service for the 30 
		miles between the boat business and my rental car. Later in the week, 
		they arranged for the return transportation.<br><br>I kept wondering 
		that if these were my first four weeks, what else could possibly I 
		happen during the next nineteen weeks. There weren't too many more 
		surprises, just I more great opportunities to get to know the Rotarians 
		and outstanding service work ' they were doing. By December 19th, I had 
		finished my visits and wished I could I start over to see what they had 
		accomplished since I had been with each club. Fifty four nights away 
		from home were made possible by an understanding husband, an excellent 
		store manager, an efficient district secretary and his secretary, who 
		loaned I me their office couch for mid-afternoon naps when I was 
		exhausted, a cellular phone and a laptop computer.<br><br>As nominee, I 
		was kidded about my being the &quot;Queen Bee.&quot; After visiting each of those 
		61 clubs and two provisional clubs, which chartered by mid-year, I truly 
		felt like a queen. Everywhere I went, I was treated like royalty and 
		with the utmost respect. I think the smaller rural clubs were especially 
		interested in my visit for they knew I understood their problems and 
		situations. Perhaps having a woman governor encouraged some of the clubs 
		to look at each district governor as an individual person with different 
		interests. I think they tried to make my visit special and looked at the 
		governor's visit in a new light because I am a woman. They were probably 
		relieved that my husband didn't make the visits with me, so they didn't 
		have to figure out how to entertain a male spouse of a governor. It 
		wouldn't have been a problem for them, he would have enjoyed 
		participating in all the Rotary meetings and activities.<br><br>I 
		stepped into the role of governor in an already active and enthusiastic 
		district. The outstanding leadership in our district during the previous 
		years had established a strong foundation of service and programs, on 
		which we were able to build. The past governors' help was always 
		willingly given whenever I asked. We have been extremely involved in 
		matching grants that has led to other international interests and 
		projects. District Rotarians are now looking for projects as they 
		travel. One Rotarian, while giving a banking seminar in Mongolia and 
		visiting the new Rotary club, learned of their desire to start the first 
		English language library in the country.<br><br>Upon his return, his 
		club began collecting &quot;Books for Mongolia.&quot; When others in the district 
		learned of the project, they wanted to participate, so we adopted it as 
		a district project. Of the 42,000 pounds of books collected, one of our 
		provisional clubs contributed over 12,000 pounds of that total.<br><br>
		Another Rotarian called to say he would be attending the Russian Peace 
		Forum in Anchorage and could he commit the district to anything 
		reasonable. It takes trust in your fellow Rotarians to say, &quot;Go ahead!&quot; 
		He also told me his club would be sponsoring the new Rotary Club of 
		Chita, Russia. As a result of his attending the forum, a Russian teacher 
		was sent to our district to study our teaching methods, especially 
		English as a Second Language. It was so successful that a teacher from 
		Chita will come this year, as well as a youth exchange student. Some 
		Chita Rotarians will be visiting as well. Sometimes I felt as though my 
		hardest job was just keeping up with everything the Rotarians were doing 
		in the district and around the world. The growing interest in the 
		international part of Rotary and in the Foundation was demonstrated by 
		our doubling the goal we had set for annual giving.<br><br>With more and 
		more people becoming interested in the Internet, our district made the 
		decision to have a home page, including the newsletter each month, as a 
		way to reach more Rotarians quicker with the districts news. When I 
		finally learned how to find our home district page on the Internet, 
		there was my picture as district governor. I suppose you could compare 
		it to seeing your picture on the front page of a newspaper for the first 
		time. We feel the page will be helpful in making contact with districts 
		around the world who are interested in similar projects. We also think 
		it will promote more interest in Rotary.<br><br>My year as district 
		governor ended on a high note, when I served as chairman of the Texas 
		Breakfast at the Calgary Convention. It was a time of celebration, 
		meeting new friends, renewing friendships with Rotarians from around the 
		world and making promises to meet again. There's no better way to end a 
		once-in-a-lifetime experience than that.<br><br>July 1, 1996, arrived 
		and the calendar told me the year as governor was over. Although most of 
		our goals were met or surpassed, not all our projects were completed. 
		Several international projects planned or initiated while I was governor 
		will be completed during my successor's year. Our district's second 
		reverse Matching Grant, a community garden in Fort Worth, has been 
		approved with the Rotary Club of Hou Kuong, Macao, as our partner. We 
		have discussed organization of a Rotary Community Corps to supervise it.<br>
		<br>As a result of our outstanding Group Study Exchange with Bangladesh, 
		we have applied for our first Carl Miller Discovery Grant to help the 
		Rotary Club of Jalalabad, Sylhet, Bangladesh, in establishing the 
		country's first rehabilitation hospital. We want to continue the 
		friendships we made through the GSE program. Perhaps I was closer to 
		them, not only because I was governor, but because the pastor from my 
		church was our out-bound team leader.<br><br>From a contact made during 
		the international institute in Anaheim while I was governor, we will be 
		having our first Rotary Volunteers serving abroad during the spring of 
		1997. Two nursing instructors will be going to Madras, India, to teach 
		advanced nursing for intensive Care and Surgery.<br><br>When my 
		successor asked me to serve as District international Chairman, I was 
		happy to agree. In addition to that position, he asked that I also 
		oversee the Discovery and Volunteer Grants Committees. I'll be able to 
		bring those unfinished projects to completion and maintain the 
		international contacts I have made with Rotarians worldwide.<br><br>I'm 
		sure all district governors see too late areas that needed more 
		attention or action. This happened to me in the area of the Rotary 
		Foundation Scholars Program. During our district's interviews, we were 
		discussing the program. I realized that we were doing the best we could 
		for orientation of two or three scholars, but I had heard about 
		multi-district orientations that were much more effective than ours. The 
		nine Rotary districts in Texas participate in Lone Star PETs and a 
		statewide orientation for our Youth Exchange. Fellow Governor Bill 
		Bechtol, and I felt very strongly that we, too, should have a statewide 
		or zone-wide orientation for our Foundation scholars. After talking with 
		him, I agreed to be chairman of the program with his help. Several 
		discussions with PDGs Anne and Bill Robertson of Kentucky about their 
		multi-district program helped us have a quality program. Bill generously 
		furnished materials from their program, registration flyers, programs, 
		evaluations, financial reports and other information. Ken Morgan of 
		North Carolina also helped with ideas and encouragement. We're looking 
		forward to having a representative from the Foundation with us for this 
		first one. The orientation, to be held in January 1997, will have 
		approximately twenty-five to thirty participants, half of them scholars. 
		Alumni will be doing much of the orientation while the Rotarians will be 
		exploring ways of improving the selection process and the role of 
		sponsors, counselors and alumni in their districts. Eight of the twelve 
		districts in Zone 26 and New Mexico from Zone 25 have registered for the 
		program. This program, if it's as successful as I feel it will be, may 
		be my most important and lasting contribution to Rotary international.<br>
		<br>With the many ideas and plans that we weren't able to accomplish 
		during one year, I can see why people agree to serve as governor a 
		second time. I'll continue to be involved in many areas of Rotary 
		service. It was an honor to be asked to make a presentation to the 1996 
		Spouses program at PETs, and 1996 Zones 25 &amp; 26 Foundation Meeting. I 
		will have spoken to clubs in two other districts, and will be a guest 
		speaker at another district conference. In March, I'll be facing another 
		real challenge, that of discussion leader at Lone Star PETs. These 
		invitations may have come partly because I am a woman. Rotarians are 
		looking for us, the first women governors, to be role models for all 
		women and to encourage more involvement of Women and Rotary.<br><br>In 
		Rotary, it doesn't matter whether we're men or women. As Rotarians, 
		we're serving our fellow man, at home and abroad, and working for 
		worldwide friendship and peace through Rotary.&nbsp;</td>
