		7230 has approximately 2,000 members and consists of forty five Rotary 
		Clubs, as such: 31 clubs in Westchester County; two in the Bronx; three 
		in Manhattan; five on Staten Island and four in Bermuda. One of the 
		first items of necessity in this DG world is to gain experience and 
		knowledge of your District and to get known. A definite must.<br><br>I 
		was lucky, I had been co-chairman of two district conferences and World 
		Community Chairman of the District. I also went as a DGN with the 
		District Governor of 1994-1995 on all of his club visits. He was very 
		gracious and introduced me at ever opportunity. It was a very good 
		experience along with the Zone Institute and Anaheim.<br>&nbsp;<br>One of my 
		visits was to a club that had as its 1995-1996 president a past district 
		governor. He indicated on his Club Summary report that there was no need 
		for my visit as they had three PDGs in the club. He completed his 
		summary without the knowledge of his Board of Directors. He also 
		indicated that I would need his help more than he would need mine. I 
		read his comments to his Board of Directors at my official meeting with 
		them since they had not seen or heard what was written by the Club 
		President. Needless to say, the Club President apologized for his 
		actions in front of his club's meeting that day.<br>&nbsp;<br>Another of my 
		Westchester clubs, located on Long Island Sound, had an unusual setting 
		for my official visit. As I had sent letters to all Club Presidents 
		advising them of the date and time, two months before my visit, I 
		received a call the evening before the aforementioned club's visit, from 
		the president, asking &quot;Are you really coming at 10:45 A.M.?&quot; I replied 
		yes, as scheduled. The DGN and I arrived at the scheduled time and we 
		waited and waited. Fifteen minutes late, the Club President arrived, 
		alone, toting a large cardboard box with coffee and breakfast buns. He 
		announced he wanted to hold the official visit in the park across from 
		the meeting place as it was so nice outside (July, 80 degrees).<br>&nbsp;<br>
		Never batting an eyelash I agreed. I could see that he was trying to 
		discourage me from asking too many questions about the club (all males) 
		and better yet, on his failure to complete and submit his Club's Summary 
		and Projects for the year. We had our meeting and it was noticed then 
		that the Club Secretary came to the restaurant and he could not believe 
		his eyes when he saw the picnic on the rocks of the park. It seems the 
		Club President neglected to inform his club about my visit and was 
		marking time. We went in for lunch, and he asked me to sit with the 
		other members, which I did, and give my talk. Since this was such an 
		informal club setting I proceeded to give my talk and a little bit more. 
		I asked for questions and drew this comment from one of the long-time 
		members, &quot;you're in Rotary for such a short time, how did you become so 
		knowledgeable?&quot; I told him that I read the Rotarian magazine, cover to 
		cover!<br>&nbsp;<br>
		<img class="auto-style25" height="156" src="chirafisi-full.jpg" style="float: left" width="231">My year was very special because of the celebration in 
		New York of the United Nations and Rotary International Anniversary of 
		Fifty years. I, being the District Governor of New York, got to speak to 
		the delegates of the U.N. and to introduce Cardinal O'Connor at a 
		luncheon meeting. Also, President Herbert Brown came to this three-day 
		celebration. It was a truly wonderful happening.<br><br>July 1, 1995, 
		Rotary International, had for the first time in history, women District 
		Governors, a total of eight. District 7230 has 45 Rotary Clubs, 31 in 
		Westchester County, two in the Bronx, three in Manhattan (New York 
		City), five on Staten Island and four in Bermuda.<br>&nbsp;<br>A little about 
		this first woman District Governor for District 7230. Gilda Chirafisi's 
		home club is the Rotary Club of Riverdale, which meets weekly, on 
		Thursday evenings at 6:30 P.M., in a small restaurant in Riverdale. 
		Governor Chirafisi became a Rotarian on July I, 1988, sponsored by the 
		first woman member of the Rotary Club of the Bronx. After much 
		deliberation whether to remain in the Bronx Club (a luncheon club) or 
		move to the Rotary Club of Riverdale because of the more convenient 
		meeting time, she moved in 1989. It was a good move and Chirafisi served 
		as club secretary for two years and became president in 1991. The Club 
		grew from 18 to 25 members that year, as well as presenting three Paul 
		Harris Fellowship recognitions and funding Community and International 
		Service Projects. A major community achievement was the funding of a Day 
		Care Center in the Bronx Municipal Hospital for Children with AIDS. This 
		agency, the only one of its kind in New York City, had been being 
		threatened with closure due to the lack of state funds. Through a 
		benefit concert and with the joint efforts of the Rotary Clubs of the 
		Bronx and Riverdale, not to mention the publicity of the fate of the day 
		care center, funds were obtained and the Center remained open.<br>&nbsp;<br>
		</td>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19" style="width: 50%">Another 
		incident was losing my briefcase in a Bermudan taxi with all my notes. 
		This was after my first visit and I had three more to go. We searched 
		right up until I was to speak to the largest Club, the Rotary Club of 
		Hamilton. I had my official visit and was trying to put in sequence on 
		paper the notes that I had lost. The reason for my concern was that I 
		was to be on a radio broadcast, as the Hamilton Club broadcast their 
		meetings each week in Bermuda, as a community service. I finally gave up 
		this method as it wasn't working. When the President introduced me to 
		the Club, I told them of my situation and I then began to speak without 
		notes for about twenty minutes without stopping. I was amazed, but 
		because I had said my talk so much, I had, without realizing it, 
		memorized the whole thing! Later that evening as we were leaving the 
		hotel for dinner, the same taxi came to pick us up. I asked the driver 
		about my briefcase and he reported that he brought it into the hotel 
		early that A.M. and left it behind the main desk where it had been all 
		day! From then on, no more notes.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Rotary Club of New York, 
		the number 6 club in the world, gave me another incident. For the first 
		time, the district had a Rotaract Club comprised of graduate students 
		and interns at the United Nations. So, on my official visit I 
		congratulated the Club for this wonderful beginning of Rotaractors. The 
		Club President was very upset and red-faced, saying that there would be 
		no new Rotary Club in New York City, not hearing that I said Rotaract 
		Club. His reasons for being upset were the territorial rights the #6 
		Club claims. However, in the audience were at least six PDGs who heard 
		me loud and clear.<br>&nbsp;<br>I must say, that the best highlight of my 
		year was my District Conference, held in the middle of April 1996 at the 
		Marriott Marquis Hotel in mid-town Manhattan. I had two top-notch 
		speakers, one the Mayor of the City of New York, Rudolph Giulliani, for 
		the Saturday luncheon meeting, and Richard D. King, Trustee of Rotary 
		International, as the keynote speaker for the Governor's Paul Harris 
		Fellows Dinner-Dance, Saturday evening. I had winners for both events, 
		bringing in over 1,000 people from Westchester, Bronx, Staten Island, 
		Manhattan and Bermuda We had a record attendance for the Governor's 
		dinner, 350 people attended. It was an exciting time!<br>&nbsp;<br>In my 
		position as a District Governor, I saw no difference between being a 
		woman Rotarian or a man Rotarian We were, and are, doing a job well 
		needed, and if necessary, I would do this all over again, willingly and 
		with having some more insight, a little better than the first time.<br>&nbsp;<br>
		When I look back, I am proud to say that some of my goals were achieved. 
		We brought into the District a new project, The Gift of Life. 
		Sixty-eight percent of my Share for the Rotary Foundation was obtained. 
		I also think that I had people being aware that there were places to go 
		other than Westchester County.<br>&nbsp;<br>My family has been very 
		supportive, especially my husband, who is president-elect of his club, 
		the Rotary Club of The Bronx, and we did have to juggle some private 
		happenings, but it all worked out.<br>&nbsp;<br>I will not, and would not, 
		trade my time spent with my District, especially the people who run the 
		clubs, for one minute in watching something special on the TV. It was a 
		great year in my life and I will cherish the memories, all of them!<br>&nbsp;<br>
		July 1997, President Luis Vicente Giay appointed me as Zone Coordinator 
		for Zone 32, Membership Task Force. We are now finally showing an 
		increase in membership for this Zone!<br><br>Chirafisi was born in New 
		Haven, Connecticut, educated in the New Haven School System, attended 
		New Haven State Teachers College, Yale School of Drama and Columbia 
		University, School of General Studies. Her business career began in New 
		Haven, directly from high school, as the youngest branch manager of the 
		Western Union Telegraph Company. After four years of work, a decision 
		was made to attempt another career, the theatre. Acceptance to the Yale 
		School of Drama was based on her summer stock experience.<br>&nbsp;<br>Upon 
		coming to New York City to become the &quot;best actress ever&quot; it became 
		apparent that it was necessary to find steady employment. And indeed, 
		employment was in advertising, accounting, sales and several high level 
		positions in educational institutions. Now retired after twenty-five 
		years at Columbia University, nine and half years of which were spent as 
		Director of Special Events for the Columbia School of Law. Also while 
		employed at Columbia, she was President of the Faculty Association, a 
		University service organization, for five years.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gilda Chirafisi 
		has been married to Dominick J. Chirafisi for 47 years. He is a cereal 
		chemist and member of the Rotary Club of the Bronx and resides in the 
		Riverdale section of the Bronx. Gov. Gilda is very active in community 
		organizations and serves on two boards, the American Red Cross, Bronx 
		Chapter, and the Bronx Arts Ensemble. She is a member of the Columbia 
		University Faculty House Association. Her interests lie in the arts, 
		theatre and music, and is trying to lower her golf handicap.</td>
