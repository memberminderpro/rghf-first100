		governor of District 6380 was a particular privilege to me personally 
		since it is an international district, including clubs in both Canada 
		and the United States, and I, although a US citizen, am a direct 
		descendant of some proud Canadians. Getting to know Canadian Rotarians, 
		learning more about the country, singing its national anthem so very 
		often, and feeling as if I were contributing something to the country in 
		my small way, were all important parts of the rewards of being governor. 
		Both before and since my year as governor I have attended Canadian Zone 
		Institutes as well as US Zone Institutes, and this also has helped my 
		special Canadian connection remain meaningful.<br>&nbsp;<br>District 6380 had 
		52 clubs and an additional provisional club during 1995-96. Seven of 
		these clubs are in Canada. There is a typical mix of old large clubs and 
		small struggling clubs. The oldest and largest club in the district is 
		the Ann Arbor Club, in my own hometown of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Members 
		of that club often ask how it was that I became a member of the Ann 
		Arbor North Club when Rotary membership first opened to women in 1987. I 
		was the highest ranked woman administrator at the University of Michigan 
		at the time and the big old downtown club thought that I would certainly 
		be joining them. Actually, however, they neglected to invite me in a 
		timely fashion and so I<br>joined the 
		up-and-coming north-side club. This is a story I remembered often when I 
		spoke to clubs about the Rotary membership drive during my year as 
		governor.<br>&nbsp;<br>I first became active in district affairs during the 
		year in which I was club president, 1990-91. In my position as Associate 
		Vice President at the University of Michigan my responsibilities 
		included the supervision of the university's International Center and 
		its Director. Hence, I was recruited by a Past District Governor, who 
		also was affiliated with the university, to head up the Ambassadorial 
		Scholarship Committee for the district. This responsibility required me 
		to be in contact with club presidents and appropriate committee members 
		and to attend the district staff meetings every other month. Even a 
		brief exposure to district operations convinced me that there was 
		considerable opportunity to be of service, given my administrative and 
		organizational training and experience as well as my deep commitment to 
		the work of Rotary.<br>&nbsp;<br>During my year as District Governor Nominee 
		I also served as District Foundation Committee Chair, organizing the 
		district's first Foundation Dinner and promoting the importance of 
		annual giving for all Rotarians. Many clubs instituted matching giving 
		programs to encourage individual members to give, often using old Paul 
		Harris &quot;credit&quot;, for very creative incentives. That year district annual 
		giving exceeded $100,000 for the first time ever. Another assignment 
		during my DGN year was to chair a committee to completely revise the 
		district's Policies and Procedures. These were in quite a mess, not in 
		compliance with the Manual of Procedure and not being followed by the 
		District Governors. The new Policies and Procedures proposed by my 
		committee were discussed at club presidents' meetings and at the 
		District Assembly and Conference. After appropriate revision they were 
		approved by mail ballot early in my year as governor and implemented 
		immediately.<br>&nbsp;<br>Professionally, I am a university faculty member as 
		well as university administrator, and so I viewed the RI training for 
		district governors from the point of view of considerable experience in 
		adult education. However, I must quickly add that I am a person who 
		learns and retains more from what I read than from any other source, 
		including group discussion or &quot;problem solving&quot; exercises. The written 
		material provided by Rotary in the governor's manual was thorough and 
		thought provoking. Discussions with PDGs and others at zone institutes 
		and at the International Assembly helped immensely to alert me to issues 
		I would need to consider and to acculturate me to Rotary's ways. Since I 
		was facing a number of rather unique problems in my district not shared 
		by other DGNs, perhaps, I would have welcomed some one-on-one 
		conversations with the very experienced group discussion leaders and 
		other Rotary leaders present at Anaheim.</td>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19" style="width: 50%">My most urgent 
		goal for my year as governor was to get the district's operations into 
		compliance with the Manual of Procedure and to establish realistic 
		budgeting and financial controls. It was also necessary to reorganize 
		the area representative sectors and to clarify district staff 
		accountabilities. When I took over July 1, 1995, there was no money in 
		the district's bank account and almost $6000 of bills and debts. When I 
		finished on July 1,1996, there was a $12,000-plus surplus and also a 
		system of financial control and accountability.<br>&nbsp;<br>During my year 
		the Foundation annual giving exceeded the outstanding level of the year 
		before. The district also was first in the US and fourth in the world in 
		restricted giving to the Foundation, due largely to a $100,000 gift from 
		a local foundation, which I helped to tie down. It was a great thrill to 
		have RI President Herb Brown attend my District Conference and 
		personally convey the Major Gift recognition. Clubs in the district got 
		involved in a water well project being coordinated by our Zone Director, 
		and, for the first time in our district, an Ambassadorial Scholarship 
		was donated to another district in a poorer country.<br>&nbsp;<br>Clubs in 
		the district worked hard on the Calgary Challenge membership drive and 
		we came within one member (!) of winning the Challenge for our zone. The 
		district conference had the highest attendance in ten years and actually 
		made money. With my husband's help the district started down the high 
		tech path; eight of my twelve newsletters were delivered by Fax, several 
		clubs started home pages, and a number of clubs began using Clubmate 
		software for club bookkeeping and membership records.<br><br>Also with 
		the help of my husband a new district logo was designed and converted 
		into ' pins, stationery, bookmarks and district directory covers.<br>&nbsp;<br>Being 
		in the first group of women governors was perhaps harder for my husband 
		than for me. After all, I joined the legal profession in 1954 when there 
		were very few women lawyers, so this experience was not new to me. My 
		husband found great variety in the treatment of spouses. In our district 
		he is known as a Rotarian and past president of our club and is treated 
		accordingly. But as a governor’s spouse he sometimes found &quot;spouse 
		programs&quot; simplistic and stereotyping. He learned that many professional 
		female spouses felt the same way. On the other hand, Dianne Brown, wife 
		of RI President Herb Brown always solicited my husband's views on 
		substantive Rotary matters and treated him, as well as all spouses, with 
		great personal respect.<br>&nbsp;<br>My husband and I decided to take on the 
		governor’s position in connection with a decision that each of us would 
		retire from our positions at the University of Michigan. We viewed this 
		work in Rotary as a project which we could work on together after so 
		many years involved in separate professional careers. We were not 
		disappointed. We had many wonderful times together and with other 
		Rotarians. It was a great experience. We had planned, when our year as 
		governor was over, to sell our family home and move into a condominium. 
		As it happened, we had to move up the dates because the condominium 
		location we wanted was selling very rapidly. I would not recommend 
		building a new home, selling an old one, and moving households during 
		the year as Rotary governor!<br>&nbsp;<br>In all of my work with Rotary I 
		have found the staff at the Secretariat to be extremely helpful. Not 
		only are they ready and willing and able to assist, but they can be 
		relied upon to be discrete.</td>
