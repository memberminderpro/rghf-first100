		<img class="auto-style25" src="6310distmap.jpg" style="float: left">District 
		6310 is small compared to most of the districts in the Rotary world. We 
		have only 31 clubs in a predominantly rural area of east central 
		Michigan. There are approximately 1,500 Rotarians; twelve clubs had 
		fewer than 25 members. One Interact Club exists in the district, and 
		during 1995-96 there were eight outbound exchange students and 16 
		inbounds. No new clubs were chartered during my year as DG; in fact, one 
		club returned its charter. This club started the year with 14 members, 
		six of whom wintered in the south for six months of the year including 
		the club president.<br><br>My familiarity with the District was 
		relatively strong in that my husband, Andy, had preceded me as DG. He 
		was in the class of 1991-92. I attended many of his club visits and had 
		a chance to see up close the role of the District Governor in both its 
		glory and tribulations. He was an exemplary role model, as he took his 
		position seriously without taking himself seriously. In other words he 
		did justice to the position without self-aggrandizement.<br><br>Those 
		who know Andy are aware of his strengths in public speaking. Clubs were 
		invigorated after his address. That was a quality I wanted to bring to 
		my year. He was very helpful to me, and while I will never be as 
		articulate and inspiring as he was during his year, I certainly was 
		better than I would have been without his coaching assistance. He was my 
		greatest champion and supporter among a strong field of contenders.<br>
		<br>Past District Governors from my district were supportive in every 
		way possible. They shared generously of their time, offered valuable 
		insights and information, and were always uplifting in their demeanor. 
		They brought their full resources to bear to help both me, and the 
		district, be successful during my year. They were strong contributors 
		and valuable allies without ever being overbearing. I have nothing but 
		praise and the fondest of feelings for them. They were one of my 
		greatest gifts.<br><br>The International Assembly was a magical 
		experience—both times in which I was a participant. Going there first as 
		spouse to a DGN, I experienced the internationality of Rotary. I was a 
		bud just beginning to bloom in the warmth of delegates from all over the 
		world. An avid student of world cultures, I participated in the spouses' 
		sessions in French, Spanish and English. I learned firsthand how 
		Rotarians from other parts of the world viewed Rotary, what their 
		commitment was, and the benefits they derived from their participation. 
		It was a life-changing experience. I left Anaheim in 1991 (at that time 
		a club president-elect) knowing that I would be both influenced by and 
		an influence on Rotary International.<br><br>When I returned to Anaheim 
		as a DGN, I could not imagine how the experience could be any better. It 
		was, and the reasons were RI President-Elect Herb Brown and his wife, 
		Diane.<br><br>I grew up in an age of scrutinizing leadership and 
		challenging their actions. Herb Brown not only did the right things, he 
		did everything right. How well I remember him during his first plenary 
		address. He acknowledged the women district governors-nominee and voiced 
		his commitment to our success. I felt the words he chose, and the 
		brevity and style in which he delivered them, affirmed us as women in 
		our role as district governors without detracting from the men who had 
		worked equally hard to attain the same position. He could not have 
		handled the situation better.<br><br>During the difficult times of my 
		year, I reflected on Herb and Diane Brown, and found great inspiration 
		in their leadership. To this day, their 1995 holiday season family photo 
		remains immediately above my computer keyboard.<br><br>My match for a 
		group study exchange was with a district in England. Thus, I was paired 
		in Anaheim with a DGN who found, much to his astonishment, he was 
		working with a woman. Gentlemanly and courteous, the look of perpetual 
		surprise never left his face. He would comment, &quot; I don't know how I'm 
		going to go back to my district and explain that I was matched with 
		you!&quot; I graciously offered him the blue copy of the three-part form we 
		needed to complete and kept the pink for my files. It was my first real 
		introduction to being perceived first as a woman and second as a 
		district governor. I could have fun with it.<br><br>Our GSE turned out 
		to be a very positive experience for both of our districts. The quality 
		of both the inbound and outbound teams was outstanding. Our outbound 
		team leader, a college president, was rigorous in his schooling of our 
		team members. The English district had women Rotarians, but relatively 
		few of them. The reality of a female district governor was astonishing. 
		Thus, I'm told, our team leader relished the opportunity to introduce me 
		via a full-screen slide to a bastion of male Rotarians. It had a 
		jaw-dropping effect.<br><br>During PETS, I gave each president-elect the 
		opportunity to select the day he or she wanted me to make my official 
		visit. One PE was particularly eager. He followed up with me quickly to 
		get my commitment for July 5, just five days into the year. My reaction 
		was very positive. Here, I thought, was a PE I had impressed during our 
		training program. Perhaps it was my speaking style. Maybe he appreciated 
		my message... my organization. I was exuberant on the day of this, my 
		first official visit.<br><br>Upon our greeting I inquired as to what 
		quality he saw that compelled him to have me address his club so early 
		in the year. He explained that his club meets in a church basement, and 
		the women of the church would cook for no fewer than 15 people. They had 
		14 club members. I made the distinctive difference. </td>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19" style="width: 50%">One small club 
		in our district showed little district or international participation 
		with Rotary. <br><br>My&nbsp; repeated attempts to contact this club 
		president-elect went without response. He did not attend PETS, nor had 
		the presidents prior to him. Knowing that they were a club at risk I 
		slated them for my third official visit. Letters and phone messages went 
		out calling for a meeting with club officers an hour before their club 
		meeting was scheduled to begin. I received no acknowledgment. <br><br>
		Unwavering, I traveled the distance to the rural restaurant where the 
		club met. To my surprise, the door was locked, yet I could hear voices 
		inside. Knocking at the door garnered no response. I peered through the 
		high window; there were people inside. Suddenly the door opened and a 
		man came out - I grabbed the door and went in. No sign of anyone waiting 
		for me. Diners were finishing their meals. I took a seat and quizzed the 
		waitress. The restaurant locked its doors an hour before the Rotary 
		meeting, she explained, so those having dinner would have a chance to 
		finish and leave before the eight Rotarians came in for their meeting. I 
		waited.<br><br>An hour later they began to arrive. Their air was very 
		casual. They seemed surprised to see me - their president had not spoken 
		of my visit. I had a chance to talk with them informally about their 
		club before the president arrived.<br>He greeted me pleasantly and 
		called the meeting to order. No program had been planned so I was 
		welcome to give my address. I opted for less formality and asked for a 
		conversation about their Rotary Club. All too apparent was the need for 
		membership growth. When I asked what was being done about inviting new 
		members I was told that attempts had been made in the past and were 
		fruitless. There was no longer anything that could be done. I politely 
		disagreed.<br><br>These men were mostly either retired farmers or 
		forestry men. I asked what would happen if seeds were not sown in the 
		spring. Would prayer and wishful thinking harvest the fall crops? The 
		discussion became livelier and more meaningful.<br><br>The club is still 
		struggling and may not survive. But I felt I had done my best when this 
		song was offered at the conclusion of the meeting. It was composed by 
		one of the club members during the span of our discussion. I keep it as 
		it was written, penciled onto the back of the Rotarian's paper placemat:<br>
		<br>&quot;Our Rapp Song&quot;<br>&quot;Our new Gov is Donna,<br>We think she's neat and<br>
		Has a great persona.<br><br>She is our new first<br>Lady - and even 
		though<br>She's new to the system,<br>We think she'll be<br>On-line to 
		solve the problem.<br><br>Donna will bring new ideas<br>To Rotary, if we 
		help<br>Her she'll make us strong<br>As new trees.<br><br>Traveling down 
		the road,<br>Donna will call on all<br>Clubs to be bold. Help us<br>To 
		mature and be old.&quot;<br><br>In my experience as a Charter member of my 
		club, past president, Rotarian spouse of a District Governor and 
		District Governor, I have never felt that I have been treated 
		inappropriately, discriminated against or held back because I am a 
		woman. Rather I have felt encouraged, supported, assisted and elevated 
		because of the contributions I can bring to Rotary as a person who 
		happens to be female.<br><br>It has been with mixed feelings that I have 
		been interviewed and had my photo taken with the other women district 
		governors. It's not because I am not proud of being part of this 
		outstanding group, but because I see myself not as one of the eight 
		first women governors in the world, but as one of 515 governors in the 
		world during 1995-96. And each of the 507 others is deserving of 
		recognition.<br><br>I think the reason Rotary has grown stronger 
		throughout its 90-year history is because of diversity. Few 
		organizations possess this attribute. In fact, many others are based on 
		being exclusive rather than inclusive.<br><br>Rotary forces diversity 
		through its classification system. And, in fact, it was Paul Harris 
		himself who wanted Rotary to be an organization where politics and 
		religion were not barriers to membership. I think that was the genius of 
		Rotary, both past and present. Young, old; women, men; different faiths 
		and cultures - diversity should be seen as an asset, not a liability.<br>
		<br>Women will have the potential to serve Rotary in any capacity they 
		would like. What I would hope for is that, as with men, their 
		aspirations are equally matched by their ability.<br><br>This year I am 
		serving on the RI Task Force for New Generations, under the leadership 
		of Howard D. Vann, General Coordinator.<br><br>At the 1995 international 
		Assembly, I remember the humble words of RI President Saboo. He said 
		that as fulfilling as it had been to serve Rotary as its president, he 
		looked forward to a future of working in Rotary at the club level again.<br>
		<br>I have had the privilege of serving Rotary in the capacity of a 
		member of an International Task Force and as a District Governor. Yet I 
		receive as much satisfaction from doing a job well for my club. I 
		believe the real work of Rotary is not at the international level or 
		district level, although very good things are done there. The real value 
		of Rotary is at the grass roots level, the thousands and thousands of 
		Rotary Club members around the world.</td>
