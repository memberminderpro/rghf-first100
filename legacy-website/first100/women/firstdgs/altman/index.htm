		Governor District 6440 - 1995-1996</td>

	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19" style="width: 50%">
        <img class="auto-style25" height="239" src="6440distmap.jpg" style="float: left" width="208">July 1, 1995, a very special day in my Rotary life, dawned sunny and 
		warm. I had a special glow in my heart, as I thought about the plans and 
		dreams I had created for District 6440 during the coming year, and as I 
		thought of my many adventures with Rotary and Rotarians throughout my 
		life.<br><br>As I enjoyed my morning coffee, I couldn't help wondering 
		what my father, Herbert C. Angster, would have thought about this day. 
		He was the first district governor of District #8 comprising the entire 
		States of Illinois and Indiana back in 1915. And now, 80 years later, I, 
		his daughter, would assume the same position for a portion of that area, 
		District 6440. What would he think about women Rotarians, let alone 
		eight women in the United States, becoming district governors on that 
		day? My reaction was that each of us would have his blessing and good 
		wishes.<br><br>I couldn't help but think of my good friend PDG Jack 
		Bakeman, who had traveled from his new home in Florida back to 
		Deerfield, Illinois to install me as district governor. I also thought 
		about Dr. Joseph D. Boyd, the man who had proposed me to Rotary and 
		nurtured me, from being a member in 1987, to a real Rotarian ready to 
		assume this most prestigious office. Jack and Joe have been my mentors, 
		my advisors, and most of all cherished friends. Now it was up to me to 
		carry the responsibility of moving District 6440 to new heights in the 
		coming year.<br><br>District 6440 is located in northeastern Illinois 
		and calls itself the &quot;Home District,' since its southeastern boundary is 
		Evanston, the home of Rotary international. It is bounded on the east by 
		Lake Michigan, the north by the Wisconsin state line and extends west of 
		Chicago to the Fox River. The District has approximately 3000 Rotarians 
		belonging to 67 clubs. Its general population is contained in rural 
		communities ranging in size from less than 100 inhabitants to suburban 
		cities with more than 100,000 people. Its diversity is displayed 
		culturally and economically in both rural and urban areas.<br><br>During 
		my lifetime I had been fortunate to share Rotary events with my father, 
		a Chicago Rotarian from 1909-1965, my husband, past president of the 
		Highland Park, Illinois Rotary Club and my daughter, President-Elect of 
		the Rotaract Club of Evanston. As I grew up in Highland Park, Illinois, 
		many prominent Rotarians had been guests in my family home and close 
		friends, including Paul Harris, Chesley Perry, Harry Ruggles and 
		numerous others..<br><br>Now it was up to me...the mantle was on my 
		shoulders, not only to carry on the strong traditions in our district, 
		but to elevate the district to a greater height. It was up to me to 
		convince the 3000 Rotarians in the district to undertake new projects, 
		strengthen ongoing projects, support the Rotary Foundation and achieve 
		the major Rotary International project for the year, increasing and 
		retaining membership.<br><br>The Past District Governors were immensely 
		helpful as I prepared my plans for the year. They gave unstintingly of 
		their time and expertise. The Zone Institute held in Omaha, Nebraska, 
		the preceding fall, had trained me well, so that the week of training in 
		Anaheim, California, in February of 1995, had not only taught me new 
		insights, but reinforced my learning at the Zone. The Anaheim experience 
		highlighted the real diversity of Rotary. It showed me 515 districts 
		throughout the world with distinct yet similar strengths and problems, 
		and 515 district governors committed to building the strengths and 
		solving the problems.<br><br>I had spent countless hours selecting my 
		district officers and committee chairs, and with their help and that of 
		the club presidents, setting goals for the district. Now it was time to 
		put all the plans into action.<br><br>After my first &quot;official&quot; act on 
		July 4 helping my Deerfield Club conduct its annual mini-marathon, I set 
		out on my first club visit, July 6. With 67 visits on the calendar, I 
		scheduled four per week for the first few months and successfully 
		completed 66 visits before the first of the new year, with the visit to 
		my own club the first week in January. Becoming a part of the Chicago 
		morning rush hour traffic, and dealing with ever-present road 
		construction was no fun, but the club visits themselves were highlights 
		of the year. Learning the many club projects in all four Avenues of 
		Service, and the dedication of so many Rotarians was heartwarming.<br>
		<br>Each club presented a challenge as it attempted to strive for 
		membership growth and retention. I had participated in membership 
		recruitment discussions and seminars in early August, so l was able to 
		give some ideas. But, imagine my surprise when, at the conclusion of my 
		talk to one club, a long time member asked me why his club should 
		consider admitting women members. He quickly followed that question with 
		&quot;What good are women members to any Rotary Club?&quot; Ah...the old boys' 
		network at work! A hush fell over the room, and embarrassment on the 
		face of the president was obvious. I told the questioner I would answer 
		his questions, and then give him three minutes to tell all of us why 
		Rotary clubs should NOT admit women members. We each presented: our 
		answers to the club, but the exciting thing about this club is that they 
		selected a woman to be their president-elect in spite of this man's 
		negative views.<br></td>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19" style="width: 50%">The best thing about club visits was meeting and 
		reacquainting myself with district Rotarians. I had the good fortune to 
		be part of a club president's 25th wedding anniversary celebration, have 
		a club sing to me at 6:30 A.M., and another club write a parody to 
		&quot;Hello Dolly&quot; which they sang to me at their noon meeting. I gave my 
		talk to a club at the same time a jury was returning its stunning 
		verdict in one of the most celebrated criminal trials of our time in the 
		United States, and the club was patient enough to wait until I finished 
		before learning the verdict!<br><br>In addition to club visits, 
		fellowship outings were held during summer and fall, as well as seminars 
		throughout the district on membership, the Foundation and the Four 
		Avenues of Service. I attended as many evening club events as I could 
		fit into my schedule, the majority of which were auction fundraisers and 
		great fun. I managed a winning bid on so many auction items, it looked 
		as though it might be necessary to build an additional room onto my home 
		to display them!&nbsp;<br><br>There were many highlights to my year as 
		governor, but certainly one was the chartering of two new clubs in the 
		district. I made a visit to each of those clubs in the spring of the 
		year and it was gratifying to see them embracing Rotary ideals within a 
		few short months of chartering. Another highlight was my district 
		conference, held at the Grand Geneva Resort in April. Under the 
		direction of mentor Joe Boyd and an outstanding committee, attention was 
		given to all details from Thursday night to Sunday noon, and the event 
		was a huge success. Certainly an additional highlight was winning the 
		Calgary Challenge for being one of 50 districts in the Rotary world to 
		attain the greatest percentage growth in membership. Imagine being the 
		only woman governor, along with 49 male governors, accepting a beautiful 
		crystal piece from Rotary International President Herbert G. Brown at 
		the Calgary Convention. It was exciting!<br><br>Lowlights of the year 
		centered on severe weather related problems around the world. It seemed 
		there was a weather catastrophe almost every week printed in the Rotary 
		Newsbasket. Our district experienced a catastrophe in October of 1995, 
		when a school bus was hit by a commuter train killing seven high school 
		students. Clubs in the district responded immediately to an emergency 
		fund created at one of the banks, and then contributed generously to a 
		piece of sculpture created by a former Ambassadorial Scholar in the 
		district which was presented to the high school.<br><br>Looking back to the goals set at the beginning of the 
		year by me and the club presidents, district officers and committee 
		chairs, seven of the eight goals were met. The district, which has 
		always been strong in contributions to the Foundation, fell short of its 
		$205,000 goal. With no matching funds in the district it was difficult 
		to generate adequate enthusiasm for giving.<br><br>In retrospect, I 
		believe the district continued to move forward in 1995-96. With the 
		support and encouragement of the PDGs, the clubs responded to the 
		district as Rotarians, not seeming to display concern that a woman was 
		the governor. I felt surrounded with an aura of respect and affection 
		that made it a pleasure to hold the position. Would I do it again? Yes!<br>
		<br>During the 1996-97, Rotary year I have served as a member of the 
		International Interact Committee, and in 1997-98 I will serve as Zone 21 
		Coordinator of the International Literacy Committee. Both of these 
		appointments have given me a far-reaching appreciation of our 
		international organization, its members and its worldwide projects.<br>
		<br>Women Rotarians bring a separate and distinct dimension to the 
		organization. Having long been volunteers in charitable work, they are 
		excellent fundraisers. While being very well organized individuals, 
		women also bring compassion, dedication and enormous energy to 
		undertakings on the club, district and international levels. Since their 
		admission to Rotary membership in 1987, women have risen to high 
		positions in Rotary more quickly than they have in corporate America. 
		Women will have representation on the Rotary Board of Directors in the 
		near future, and a woman President of Rotary international is on the 
		horizon.<br><br>Women have proven their capabilities as Rotarians, as 
		club presidents and as district governors. Their leadership qualities 
		have been demonstrated at the club and district levels, the future will 
		see them rise to the height of Rotary.<br><br>I am proud to have served 
		as a pioneer woman district governor and to have helped blaze a trail 
		for women Rotarians to follow. My hope is that each of them will be 
		blessed with the special rewards of Rotary that were a part of my year 
		as District Governor.<br><br><iframe width="500" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RRdFNfFTPI8?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></td>
