        <img class="auto-style25" height="272" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/firstdgs/scott/7190distmap.jpg" style="float: left" width="244">My 
		husband, Ray, and I spent a truly memorable summer during my year as 
		District Governor traveling the &quot;by-roads and by-ways&quot; of the nine 
		counties comprising District 7190 in rural upstate New York, USA, from 
		Schoharie County in the south to Washington and Warren Counties in the 
		north and the Vermont border to the east.<br><br>District 7190 was part 
		of several Districts throughout the years, finally becoming District 719 
		in 1957 and 7190 in 1991. The Rotary Club of Albany, New York was 
		chartered as the 68th Rotary club in 1913 and the Troy Club was 
		chartered as 112th in 1914. These two clubs were the wellspring for 
		nearly all of the clubs in what is now District 7190. We currently have 
		46 clubs with a combined membership of 1,918. Our newest club, the 
		Rotary Club of Northern Lake George, was chartered during my year as 
		Governor. The charter date was May 17, 1996, which was the first day of 
		our three-day District Conference. I remember my excitement when I 
		received a call from Ray Bredberg, my RI Service Supervisor, just before 
		the opening session telling me the charter had been approved.<br><br>
		After retiring from the State University of New York at Cobleskill in 
		September 1993, I planned to start a small antique business, set up my 
		loom, update my weaving skills and do some traveling. We started with 
		the traveling part and left for Denmark immediately after my last day of 
		work, spending a wonderful month touring the length and breadth of a 
		lovely and picturesque country.<br><br>Upon returning home in October my 
		Rotary club suggested that I submit my name as a possible candidate for 
		District Governor Nominee. I didn't think I had much of a chance but 
		with the support of my club and their pledge to help me in any way they 
		could, I submitted the paperwork. The interview process took place the 
		first of December 1993 and my short term retirement plans changed 
		dramatically as I began my training to become the 1995-96 District 
		Governor for 7190. Several of our PDG's offered their encouragement and 
		assistance and the District Governor invited me to become part of the 
		Multi District PETS Planning Committee which met monthly. My training 
		was underway. The training at the zone level and again at the 
		International Assembly in Anaheim was motivational, focused and intense. 
		It was a great experience, one I shall long remember. What a marvelous 
		opportunity to network with my classmates from all over the world! I was 
		pleased with the way the introduction of women into the training program 
		was handled-noted by not blown out of proportion. I should note that as 
		part of a college senior administration staff I worked in a &quot;man's 
		world&quot; for over half of my professional career, therefore, being one of 
		the first women in a new role was not a new experience for me.<br><br>I 
		returned from the International Convention in Nice eager to assume my 
		duties as District Governor on July 1. The District Directory had been 
		distributed, the &quot;speech&quot; for my official club visits was ready and my 
		first newsletter was almost ready for printing. On July 15 I found out 
		that the District reserve account of approximately $27,000 had been 
		reduced to $2,500, that the District liability insurance due in mid 
		June, $2,700, had not been paid, the $4,500 account for the new computer 
		that had been ordered was really part of the $27,000 balance which was 
		no longer available and the $50 reimbursable deposit made by 26 of our 
		outgoing students in the Youth Exchange Program was also part of the 
		$27,000 reserve account. Needless to say, this was a &quot;large dose of 
		reality&quot;. My first communication as District Governor to the club 
		presidents and committee chairs was to place a freeze on the District 
		budget.&nbsp;</td>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19" style="width: 50%">The Budget and 
		Finance Committee and I spent an inordinate amount of time in the next 
		few weeks unraveling the previous year's &quot;accounting process&quot;, 
		performing an audit, implementing some standard accounting procedures 
		and revising the current year budget. I loaned the District $3,000 to 
		pay the liability insurance and appealed to the clubs to pay their 
		District dues as rapidly as possible.<br><br>Meanwhile the club visits 
		were going very well. We were made to feel welcome and &quot;special&quot; with 
		banners announcing our visit, certificates of appreciation for our 
		service to the District and small gifts unique to the area. My husband, 
		a fellow Rotarian, accompanied me on all but one of my official visits 
		as well as the area representative assigned to the club. Our District 
		theme for the year was &quot;Fostering Involvement&quot; and one of my objectives 
		throughout the year was to create a team concept and to share 
		responsibility for the club with the area representative-that was 
		achieved.<br><br>I completed all but one of my goals for 1995-96. We did 
		not make our membership goal of 9%, net gain, but we did increase y 
		approximately 6%, turning the downward spiral around and heading back 
		toward a District membership of 2,000. Our 46th club was chartered with 
		30 new members. This was the first year in many years that we achieved 
		basically 100% reporting of attendance and membership from all clubs in 
		the District every month. We made our District pledge to the Rotary 
		Foundation thanks to a special effort by three of our larger clubs and 
		had three major donor contributions, two more than I pledged. Attendance 
		at District functions increased significantly. District By law changes 
		were approved creating an Executive Council, which gives more structure 
		to the administration of the District and provides for some continuity 
		from one year to the next. Area Councils, qualifications and duties for 
		District positions and safe guards for the District Budgeting process 
		also were added to the By Laws.<br>Ray and I made a commitment to live, 
		sleep, eat and breathe Rotary for the year and we pretty much did just 
		that. We attended all of the club functions that we were invited to, 
		visited most of the clubs at least twice, some several times. Our family 
		and friends understood the commitment we had made and our family 
		participated in our events when they could, including my 94 year-old 
		mother, when she visited us during the year from California. Most of our 
		social life during the year revolved around Rotary events and our Rotary 
		friends. Our home club, the Rotary Club of Cobleskill, NY, more than 
		fulfilled their commitment to assist me in any way they could, providing 
		financial support as well as person power in completing my year as 
		Governor.<br><br>I approached the job of District Governor as a Rotarian 
		who happened to be a female. I am sure there must have been some male 
		Rotarians who were not overjoyed with a female District Governor. 
		However, I believe even they would say that I did a good job and they 
		will remember me for the job I did as District Governor and not just as 
		the first female Governor.<br><br>I am continuing to serve Rotary this 
		year, 1996-97, at the District level and at the zone level. I am the 
		Chair of the District Foundation Committee, District Leadership 
		Development Trainer, member of the 1997 District Conference Committee, 
		member of the Board of Directors of the Gift of Life Committee and 
		member of the District Executive Council. I served on the 1996 Zones 31 
		&amp; 32 Rotary Leadership Forum Planning Committee and was a Group 
		Discussion Leader for the District Governor Nominee Program and for the 
		District Leadership Development Trainers Program.<br><br>I consider it 
		an honor to have served as the 1995-96 District Governor for 7190. It 
		was a very positive experience for me and I am glad I took advantage of 
		the opportunity to be involved in Rotary beyond the club level. I have 
		learned a lot about a great service organization and the tremendous work 
		that Rotarians do around the world to further world understanding and 
		peace.&nbsp;</td>
