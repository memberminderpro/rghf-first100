        <img class="auto-style25" height="90" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/firstdgs/robertson/6710distmap.jpg" style="float: left" width="195">From 
		the day I was selected to be District Governor of Rotary District 6710 
		in the year 1995-96, life became an exciting Rotary venture. Every 
		aspect of my life, and that of my household, changed in a dramatic way.<br>
		<br>Now I know that the purpose of writing this is to tell the story of 
		the first eight women Governors of Rotary International, but my own 
		story is not mine alone. My first Rotary experiences began in 1972 when 
		my husband, Bill, became a Rotarian. As he accepted one office after 
		another up to District Governor in 1981-82, I was a part of that Rotary 
		experience. Therefore, when I became a Rotarian, I brought to my club, 
		and to Rotary, an understanding of the organization that many members 
		seldom experience.<br><br>As the first woman District Governor in 
		District 6710, many roles were reversed, including mine, my PDG 
		husband's and the many, many long-time Rotary friends we had made 
		throughout the world during the years in which we participated as PDG 
		and wife.<br><br>What do you call a woman Governor? What do you call her 
		PDG husband? How do you, a woman Governor, respond when a well-meaning 
		Rotarian in essence asks the male PDG if his DG wife can or will. do 
		something? At every level we were all breaking new ground and 
		reinventing the wheel.<br><br>My district encompasses the Western half 
		of the state of Kentucky. With one exception, my club is the 
		western-most club with the majority of the clubs being located at great 
		distances from my home. After the first week or so of Club visits within 
		my immediate area, it was necessary for me to leave home on Sunday 
		afternoon, or early Monday morning, to return on Friday. This added to 
		the urgency of tending to correspondence, laundry, (yes, DGs 
		occasionally do that also), and other work before leaving once again for 
		the &quot;club visit” circuit.<br><br>On each trip I would carry my Toshiba 
		notebook so that I could diligently do my reports nightly. Upon my 
		return home, after confronting the accumulated mail and phone calls, it 
		was time to put the disk in and print those reports and thank-you 
		letters. Eventually, both Bill and I had to admit that there really 
		wasn't going to be any other life until the end of the Rotary year.<br>
		<br>As I made Club visits to the sixty-one clubs of District 6710, I was 
		welcomed in many unique ways. Sometimes I would enter to meet with the 
		President and Secretary and realize that there was total apprehension on 
		their part as to what to expect. In other instances, I would be greeted 
		with delight that a woman was finally in position to contribute to 
		Rotary International at that level. With rare exceptions, the Rotarians 
		and Clubs of this district were gracious, friendly, and most hospitable 
		in their acceptance of their first woman DG.<br><br>The week-long 
		training at Anaheim served as a transition from what I had known and 
		experienced AS a spouse and Rotarian in the past to the present. I felt 
		that I was bringing a wealth of knowledge and experiences, along with an 
		outstanding support group at home in District 6710, to Anaheim. Yet, I 
		was eager to be fully aware of the current and future plans and 
		personnel of Rotary international. The Anaheim experience, in my 
		opinion, was a definite asset to me as incoming Governor.<br><br>At 
		Anaheim, I was asked how I intended to handle all the PDG's of my 
		District. Fortunately, I was able to reassure those in my group session 
		that, for the most part, they have been, and still are, very protective 
		of me and of my Rotary activities. As I reflect on the planning phase of 
		my year and the actual year of office, I am still amazed at the talents 
		available to me and to the District from longtime Rotary friends and 
		from those who are now active. For that encouragement and support, I 
		will always be grateful.<br><br>There were many high points that I could 
		mention. The most rewarding experiences, though, came from the support 
		and friendships that were there for me at every level of Rotary. As a 
		long-time participant in Rotary activities at Zone and other levels, 
		this support was a reaffirmation of the high calibre of those we call 
		Rotarians. I especially recall one very dear Rotary friend, the late 
		Past Rotary International President Roy Hickman, who encouraged me every 
		time I was in his presence to speak up and be a Rotarian in every sense 
		of the word. I shall never forget the impact that Roy and Dorothy had in 
		formulating my Rotary goals and those of my PDG husband, Bill.<br><br>In 
		my opinion, Rotary International, and its leadership, is recognizing 
		that women, when placed in leadership roles, usually do a very thorough 
		job. They tend to give more attention to detail. And, as we eight women 
		have commented to one another, we apparently must prove ourselves 
		everyday. It has been my observation that every District Governor who 
		has served in District 6710 has appealed to different segments of our 
		membership. I feel the same is true as women have now served as 
		Governors. In my own experience, positive responses far outweighed any 
		possible negative comments or situations.<br>All was not smooth sailing, 
		however. On a very hot summer day, I came to a small town in southern 
		Kentucky. As prescribed, I had sent the appropriate paper work and made 
		the necessary phone calls to insure the success of this visit. There was 
		no response to my letters and my attempts to call the Club President 
		produced a recorded blessing from his answering machine. Now there was 
		no doubt that I could use a few blessings at that stage, but I was 
		really seeking a confirmation of my scheduled visit.<br><br>I arrived at 
		the appointed location to be greeted by several local ladies, preparing 
		the meal, who assured me that the President had, indeed, &quot;almost up an' 
		died with a heart attack.&quot; Well, that certainly told me why there had 
		been no return calls. Ultimately, I met with a Temporary President. A 
		very nervous Temporary President, I might add. As we met to establish 
		some order, the Club Secretary, a man &quot;Older Than the Hills&quot;, joined us.<br>
		<br>His opening comment to me was &quot;Girlie&quot; (it was at this point that I 
		gained a whole new insight concerning &quot;Temporary President's&quot; 
		nervousness) I haven't let a District Governor tell me what to do for 51 
		years and I'm not about to start now!&quot; As &quot;Nervous Temporary President&quot; 
		was making a valiant attempt not to faint in the corner of his office, I 
		looked &quot;Older Than the Hills&quot; in the eye and said &quot;Well, aren't you 
		fortunate? I didn't come to do that either.&quot; He became my ally. Knowing 
		that he was Club Secretary when my PDG Bill was in office, I rushed home 
		to find out whether he had told him what to do or not. To date I have 
		yet to receive a definite answer to that question.</td>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19" style="width: 50%">Little did he 
		know that at this stage, &quot;Girlie&quot; isn't all that offensive. He was 
		worried about his Club and was prepared to do whatever 
		he had to do to keep it going until his President returned or was 
		replaced. His heart was in the right place.<br><br>District 6710 added 
		no new clubs to its existing sixty-one clubs during 1995-96. We did 
		increase our membership to a final number of 3,704. We saw many new and 
		many younger members coming into Rotary. With tremendous gratification, 
		I observed our local, District, Zone, and International involvements as 
		they proceeded in a very satisfying manner. We had a first time 
		experience of two Group Study Exchanges in the same year.<br><br>
		District Conference, according to many, was an outstanding success. I 
		certainly felt that we had one that will long be remembered. As we tried 
		to have something for everyone, we featured President Herb Brown's 
		excellent representative PDG Stan Black, and Marge, from Colorado. Past 
		RI Director and Past Trustee James Lacy was there for a meaningful 
		presentation. John Osterlund traveled from Evanston to share his vision 
		of The Rotary Foundation with our Conference. Foundation Trustee Rick 
		King, California, enthralled our audience on Saturday evening as he 
		followed an introduction by PRID Tom Duncan Reed, known to many as 
		&quot;Foster Brooks.&quot; Our host club of Paducah, joined me and others in 
		making all our guests know what a true Kentucky welcome is all about.<br>
		<br>I want to thank those, such as THE ROTARIAN in Germany, the 
		Netherlands, and Australia, as well as others, for acknowledging the 
		historical significance of the first eight women Governors in the world 
		with coverage just before we came into office. I want to thank Rotary 
		International for the opportunity to reflect on that historical year. It 
		was indeed a &quot;ground-breaking event&quot; when we became a part of the 
		progression from record keepers at the local level to decision makers 
		and leaders at the District level and is certainly one that should be 
		recorded.<br><br>The committee assignments continue for both PDG Bill 
		and for me. We are also continuing our struggle to distinguish just 
		whose mail is on whose desk. We are continuing to enjoy the involvement 
		and satisfaction that comes from our individual and combined commitment 
		to Rotary International.<br>

		how I would handle the year's experiences differently, I could certainly 
		reply that I would make many changes and change many approaches to the 
		administration of a Rotary District. I do say, however, based on the 
		fact that I have been there on both sides of the table, first as spouse 
		and then as DG, I believe I implemented some practical and positive 
		procedures. I do know, for a fact, that I had the distinct advantage of 
		having my own, on-site, and built-in advisor.<br></td>
