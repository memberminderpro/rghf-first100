    <a href="http://www.rghf.xyz/first100/women/firstdgs/firstdgs/lovrien/5520distmap.jpg">
    <img border="0" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/firstdgs/lovrien/5520distmap.jpg" width="235" height="291" class="auto-style25" style="float: left"></a>Trying 
		to put the experience of being District Governor into words is a 
		challenge. Past District Governor, Henry Pick, of District 5520 told me, 
		on more than one occasion, that this job would change my life. Several 
		of the PDG's told me this would be a fun year. Having been the spouse of 
		a district governor had prepared me, to some extent, for the experience. 
		Neither the words of the PDG's nor the experience of living with a 
		district governor had prepared me for the absolute joy I found in this 
		experience. I'm not even sure that I can explain the emotions I felt 
		during the year, but I'll try and that's what this &quot;essay&quot; is about. 
		I've told many Rotarians in this district that they should jump at the 
		chance to be district Governor. It's a privilege and an honor, of 
		course, but it's more than that. It is a life-changing experience and 
		compares to nothing else I've ever done.<br>&nbsp;<br>District 5520 is the 
		largest geographical district in the lower 48 states. It is 400 miles 
		wide by 700 miles long (about 280,000 square miles). It consists of the 
		state of New Mexico (with the exception of the Rotary Club of Raton in 
		Colfax County) and ten clubs in extreme West Texas. The West Texas 
		portion extends from El Paso down to Alpine in the Big Bend Country. The 
		total number of clubs is 59.<br>&nbsp;<br>One of my major goals was to 
		charter another club in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Albuquerque is the 
		largest city in New Mexico, with a population of about 500,000, and it 
		has only two clubs. The Rotary Club of Albuquerque was chartered in 1916 
		and has a membership of about 320. I am a member of the Rotary Club of 
		Albuquerque Del Norte, which has about 110 members and was chartered in 
		1988. The Board of Directors of the Albuquerque club voted to bring the 
		matter to a vote in the early spring of 1996. When the vote was 
		announced, opposition came out in force and the board voted to cancel 
		the club vote. They did agree to do a straw vote to get a feel of what 
		the club members wanted. The straw vote was in favor of the sponsorship 
		of a new club by a 2:I ratio. Unfortunately, this didn't happen until 
		June and it was too late to accomplish anything during my year. The 
		1996-97 administration has scheduled a vote of the club on September 30, 
		1996, and I'm confident it will pass. As my husband told me, in my 
		disappointment, I’d gotten it farther than any other governor and that I 
		should be proud of that accomplishment.<br>&nbsp;<br>One more club, in El 
		Paso, began its formation during the last days of my term as governor 
		and I am proud of the fact that those seeds were planted and began to 
		sprout during my year.<br>&nbsp;<br>In spite of the fact that my husband had 
		been a district governor (and I had done a11 of his typing and a lot of 
		his clerical work), I don't think I was fully prepared for the job. I am 
		of the opinion that the training in Anaheim is too late. I understand 
		all of the reasons for doing it when it's done, but I still believe it 
		should happen sooner. And, if that is not feasible, there should be a 
		longer training period at the zone level and Anaheim could be shorter 
		with more of an international focus. My preparation consisted of my 
		husband's term good, close and frequent communication with my 
		predecessor the Zone institute and Anaheim. Anaheim was helpful, but I 
		repeat, I think it's way too late.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was while reading the 
		Governor's Manual that I really realized how little I knew. The training 
		at Zone institute really enforced what a lot I had to learn. Anaheim 
		really brought out how huge this job is. I don't know if there is any 
		way a person can ever be completely prepared for the year as governor.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>One of my goals, prior to taking the office, was to develop a 
		better administration system for this district. I feel that this is one 
		of the things I accomplished. We are well on our way to learning to make 
		this large district more manageable. I set up a long-range planning 
		committee, which consists of the two immediate past district governors, 
		the sitting governor, the governor nominee and governor nominee 
		designate, and three past club presidents. We met three times during the 
		year (which may not seem like a lot, but remember the district covers 
		280,000 square miles) and we felt like we accomplished a lot toward 
		preparing the district to better serve the clubs. I'm really pleased 
		that my two successors are continuing with the committee. We also feel 
		that some of the actions planned will get more people involved at the 
		district level, make the governor's job a bit easier and, even possibly, 
		inspire more people to seek the governor's position.<br>&nbsp;<br>My travels 
		around this huge district put a lot of miles on my car. As I was 
		traveling from Albuquerque to Carlsbad, New Mexico, I thought I heard a 
		wrong noise and by the time I got to Roswell, I was sure of it. I 
		proceeded to Carlsbad, roaring like a hot rod. I grew up in Carlsbad and 
		my parents live there. I know lots of people in Carlsbad. While I was 
		doing my &quot;official&quot; business with the Carlsbad club, I had a high school 
		friend take my car to get it fixed. When I went to pick it up, nothing 
		had been done. It was not the muffler, as I supposed, but a hole in the 
		manifold and they needed more time to do the repair. I had to be in 
		Roswell that afternoon for the <br>visit with the officers and the club 
		assembly. So, I noisily made my way back to Roswell, was an hour late 
		for the officers' meeting. Those Rotarians did what Rotarians always do. 
		The Roswell club contacted a member of the club and I had my car to him 
		first thing the next morning and it was repaired by the time the club 
		visit was finished.<br>&nbsp;<br>Two more really wonderful things happened 
		during my year as DGN. Prior to taking office, I thought I had better 
		get some dental work done and it was discovered that my wisdom teeth 
		needed to be pulled. I didn't know a local oral surgeon, so I called a 
		Rotary friend (oral surgeon) in El Paso. I asked her what it would cost, 
		so I could plan for it ht my budget and was told that, for me, there 
		would be no cost. We argued about fairness for a few minutes and I was 
		told that this was how she could support me as governor. An appointment 
		was made and out came the teeth and I felt this was the epitome of how 
		Rotarians take care of one another.<br>&nbsp;<br>The other instance was when 
		I got a call from a member of the Albuquerque club. Both the husband and 
		wife were Rotarians and good friends and they owned a bridal shop. I 
		received a call one day asking me to come to the shop. They wanted to 
		give me a dress and I could choose any dress in the shop. It was their 
		feeling that I would have many functions to attend and this was the way 
		they could show their support of me. This was another case of the love 
		and support Rotarians continually give to one another. So many things 
		happened which only reinforced the love and encouragement I received 
		from so many people in this district. I don't think anything like these 
		two special gifts ever happened to any of the previous governors. Was it 
		because I was the first woman governor? Maybe. I only know that all of 
		that support -- large and small -really made my experience even more 
		special.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I became governor, there were six clubs in the 
		district with no women members. One of the clubs had had women in the 
		past, just none at the moment, so l knew that club did not have a 
		philosophical problem. I made the decision to confront the issue with 
		each of the clubs. Some people might question the wisdom of that 
		decision, but I still think l did the right thing. The reasons and 
		excuses I heard were numerous and some were even hilarious. The most 
		absurd was that one club respected their women too much to bring them 
		into Rotary. My response to that was that my club had a fair amount of 
		respect for me or I wouldn't have been in the position of district 
		governor. Another club told me that the men knew they would have to go 
		to work if they brought in women.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the end of my year, the 
		club that had formerly had women had women again. Then I had the 
		privilege of inducting two women into a club that had previously really 
		fought the idea. There are still four clubs without women. I think one 
		will make the move to induct women soon because they're beginning to 
		lose good, active members over this issue. In spite of the resistance to 
		women by these clubs, I was received with respect and humor. I was never 
		made to feel unwelcome or unwanted. And, I think it was good for the 
		clubs to experience a woman who takes Rotary seriously.</td>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19" style="width: 50%">The weakest 
		club in the district is one that has concerned governors for several 
		years. I failed to get the president to PETs. I failed to get him to 
		respond to any of my communications. I'm sure he has thrown away every 
		envelope with my name he ever received or just stacked them in a corner. 
		My representative worked with the club and still could get no response. 
		When the district secretary could get no information about the 
		accommodations for my visit, I began to get a suspicious feeling, so l 
		made a call to the president and was told he was hunting in Alaska. I 
		then called a past president to discover that the club was unaware of my 
		visit, which was to take place that week. Arrangements were quickly made 
		and I had a fairly good visit with the secretary and the club. This is 
		the club that will not induct women, because they don't want to have to 
		go to work.<br>&nbsp;<br>My least favorite job was the immense amount of 
		paperwork. And, I did not like getting involved in local club politics. 
		One of the clubs had a real problem with the president-elect for 
		1996-97. He kept trying to take over control of the club prior to having 
		the office as president. Members were quitting the club and officers 
		were resigning. Subtle hints didn't work. I finally appointed a 
		representative who helped with the situation and it was resolved. And, 
		it was resolved without the man leaving the club. He's still active and 
		the club members are happy, again.<br>&nbsp;<br>Women have brought to Rotary 
		a new energy and a new perspective on how things can be done. Women look 
		at things differently and find different solutions to problems. When I 
		was club president, I found the committees with women members were the 
		ones that functioned more efficiently and got the most done. I found, in 
		my visits, that the clubs with larger percentages of women members had 
		more energy and were doing more diverse projects. I really have no 
		opinion about how soon women will advance to positions higher than 
		district governor. I hope it's sooner than later, because I think the 
		women who have been district governors have ideas that can benefit 
		Rotary international<br>&nbsp;<br>The Rotarians of this district, both male 
		and female, have shown me a tremendous amount of respect. I think the 
		perception is that I've done a better than average job. People still 
		call me when they have questions or problems, because, of course, the 
		current governor has a really busy travel schedule right now.<br>&nbsp;<br>No 
		one, and I mean no one, could have had better support from their club 
		than I've had front mine. One of the highlights of my years was the gala 
		my club gave for me in November. The club wanted to celebrate my year as 
		governor and they also wanted to have a fundraiser for my favorite 
		charity, which is the Rotary Foundation of Rotary international. They 
		invited all the regional clubs to participate and there were 
		representatives from 18 Rotary clubs in attendance. The silent auction 
		and raffle raised $6000 and my club used this money as matching funds 
		for those members who desired to become Paul Harris Fellows. More than 
		$12,000 was sent to TRF. A new member of my club then donated $4000 to 
		TRF with the stipulation that it be used as matching funds for members 
		who would like to become Paul Harris Fellows. This raised an additional 
		$4000. My club gave $26,100 to TRF during my year, just over 25% of the 
		total district donation. My district foundation goal was $90,000. 
		Because of my club, this was exceeded and the total was just shy of 
		$101,000.00. No governor in this district has ever made their foundation 
		goal, with the exception of the Polio Plus campaign. In addition to all 
		of the support my club gave me through Rotary, they just nominated me 
		for Outstanding Female Executive of the Year in Albuquerque. I didn't 
		win, but was thrilled with the honor of being nominated by my Rotary 
		club.<br>&nbsp;<br>In addition to all of this, the biggest surprise came at 
		the District Conference. At the Saturday night banquet, the final awards 
		were being given and the president of my club came forward to present an 
		award. The tears came to my eyes when he presented a Paul Harris Fellow 
		to me. I was already a PHF and that first one came from my club, too. I 
		was overwhelmed and still am.<br>&nbsp;<br>I'm serving, this year, as the 
		Assistant Chair to the Permanent Fund committee. I'm the Annual Giving 
		Chair for the Foundation Committee. I'll continue my role as co-chair of 
		the District RYLA committee and as camp director of our district's Girls 
		RYLA. I was disappointed when I wasn't asked to serve on a Rotary 
		international committee, but I've decided that's OK. I'll keep busy with 
		district work until the time does come when I'm asked to do something 
		outside of the district.<br>&nbsp;<br>One of my goals was to have 10% of the 
		Rotarians in the district at the District Conference and I did achieve 
		that goal. As I've noted, I more than achieved my Foundation goal. My 
		club helped me put on an outstanding district conference. It was fun, 
		informative and we did some different things. One thing that was 
		different was the Living Business Directory. Rotarians from around the 
		district had the opportunity to talk about their businesses and how they 
		would like to do business with Rotarians in the district. It was a small 
		start, but a successful one, and it will be done again next year.<br>&nbsp;<br>
		While doing the job of district governor, I don't think there can be a 
		real balance in one's life. Our first grandchild was born in January 
		1995. Our son-in-law asked me if they had picked a bad time to have this 
		child. My reply was a resounding yes, but that there is never a perfect 
		time to have a child. In spite of my busy schedule, I found lots of time 
		to spend with the new granddaughter. I still did my job as Girls RYLA 
		camp director and had a wonderful camp because of the help I had. The 
		real challenge came when the secretary at my business walked off the job 
		in September. Clark and I own a very small, family business and have a 
		&quot;one-girl&quot; office. When that one office person left, it was a problem. 
		My daughter and daughter-in-law came to my rescue and ran the office 
		until I could take the time to hire and train a new office assistant.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>When my traveling and the club visits were over, I had a lot of 
		catching up to do at the office and at home. In fact, I'm still working 
		on catching up. I knew I had a big job to do and my feeling was that I 
		had made the commitment and Rotary would be the number one priority for 
		a year. Business and family did get a good amount of my time, but Rotary 
		was the priority.<br>&nbsp;<br>Would I do it again? You better believe it. It 
		was one of the best years of my life. I enjoyed every minute of it. I 
		learned a lot about myself Being district governor brought out some 
		strengths I didn't know I had, exposed some weaknesses and was a major 
		learning experience. If I had it to do over again, I'd do some things 
		differently, but not many. I'd mainly be better organized with my time 
		and the paperwork.<br>&nbsp;<br>My club honored me by nominating me for the 
		position of district governor. It was an honor to be selected by the DG 
		selection committee. It was one of the best years of my life. As I said 
		in my &quot;official&quot; speech, Rotary has changed my life. It's done that 
		through the opportunities I've had to serve, through-the 15 youth 
		exchange students we've hosted, through growing by helping the young 
		people at RYLA grow and change, through the friendships we've formed 
		with Rotarians and in so many other ways. But, the biggest change of all 
		came with the job of district governor. It was a fantastic time!<br><br>
