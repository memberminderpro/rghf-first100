		Alexander Thomson and the Thomson Family<br>
		<br>I have done a little research into the position of Alexander Thomson 
		but this is somewhat restricted in that most of the information would 
		have to be based on USA records. As you will know, many of these are 
		available on organisations such as Ancestry which can work out quite 
		expensive, mainly due to the fact that with a common name such as 
		Alexander Thomson there can be so many persons with that name.<br><br>I 
		have found that the Ancestry transcriptions contain quite a number of 
		errors (for example John Y(oungson) Thomson is recorded in one record as 
		John S Thomson). They have therefore to be treated with caution.<br><br>The 
		following may be of some assistance in relation to Alexander:<br><br>1. 
		When I was researching Jean Harris 
		www.rotaryfirst100.org/women/jeanharris I had some success with 
		Alexander Thomson but as I was more interested in Jean than in him I did 
		not pursue him to the full extent. One slight question mark remained and 
		that was whether he definitely emigrated to Montreal with other family 
		members on 17th September 1909. As you will see from Jean’s genealogy 
		Alexander was shown as being a salesman.<br>
		<br>The only thing that might help support this is the statement on 
		pages 99 and 100 of James P Walsh’s book “The First Rotarian” that 
		Alexander and James, together with their sister Annie, left for Canada 
		about the turn of the century and that in 1907 or 1908 Alexander and 
		James moved on to Chicago where they both obtained employment in the 
		famous Marshall Field Department store. Perhaps Alexander was a salesman 
		in Marshal Fields.<br>
		<br>The timeline on this would fit in with a 1906 immigration to the 
		USA. Unfortunately Walsh’s book does not contain any source references.<br>
		<br>2. I have so far been unable to find any other sailing from Scotland 
		to Canada that includes Alexander and certainly not in 1906.<br><br>3. As 
		Alexander and James were said (see 1 above) to have moved to Canada 
		together, I decided to carry out some further research and tried the USA 
		Naturalization Record Indexes for 1791-1992 and have been successful in 
		locating the naturalization entries for both James and Alexander. I am 
		attaching copies of these hereto. <br><br>I make the following 
		observations:<br>
		<br>a). The address of both is 10501 Hamilton Avenue in the Morgan Park 
		District of Chicago, a short distance from Paul and Jean’s home at 
		Comely Bank.<br><br>b). James date of birth is shown in the index as 
		29th April 1884 whereas the correct date of birth was 29th April 1883.<br>
		<br>c). James date of arrival in the USA is shown in the index as 29th 
		November and what appears to be 1905 but on close reference to the item 
		3455 Pierce Avenue further down in the index entry, the last digit in 
		the 1905 could be a 6 making the date of entry 29th November 1906 which 
		would tie in with the travel date of 27th October 1906 shown in my 
		previous article on Jean (this would take account of travel between 
		Scotland and then from Canada to USA.<br><br>d). Alexander’s date of 
		birth is shown in the index as 21st September 1879 whereas the correct 
		date of birth was 23rd September 1879.<br><br>e). Alexander’s name is shown as 
		Alexander Youngson Thomson whereas the name on his birth certificate is 
		simply Alexander Thomson. It was not an uncommon thing for Scots people 
		to add another family name into their birth name and as Youngson was his 
		mother’s maiden name this would fit in appropriately<br><br>f). Both 
		naturalizations were recorded at Cook County, Circuit Court, Illinois. 
		Morgan Park lies in Cook County, Chicago<br><br>g). Considering that the 
		two naturalizations took place in 1922 and 1921 respectively, it is not 
		altogether surprising that the above mentioned minor discrepancies arose 
		re the facts (perhaps through memory or even by incorrect recording) but 
		I have little doubt that the two documents are the correct ones for 
		James and Alexander. This would make Alexander’s arrival in the USA 
		about 15th September 1909 at Port of Arrival x (which possibly stands 
		for “crossing”).<br><br>This, apart from a minor discrepancy with the 
		dates would tie in with a departure from Glasgow on 17th September 1909 
		(to Montreal and Quebec.). The ship arrived in Canada on 25th September 
		1909 (which date I cross checked by reference to the Canadian Arrival 
		records). Brother John Youngson Thomson (incorrectly recorded by 
		Ancestry as John S Thomson) was also on the same ship.<br><br>h). I have 
		not previously seen any reference to any of the Thomson family being 
		naturalized US Citizens. Would this be an appropriate area for further 
		research into other members, for example, did Jean become naturalized or 
		did that happen automatically on her marriage to Paul?<br><br>If we work 
		on the basis of the 17th September 1909 date being correct travel date 
		for Alexander then we may be able to follow it through by checking the 
		Canada to USA Border Crossing Cards (also available on Ancestry under 
		“All Border Crossings from Canada to US 1895 to 1956”) to see when he 
		went from Canada to USA (Chicago). Although the content of the cards 
		varied from time to time they usually showed the date of entry to the 
		USA, sometimes the name of the ship on which they had sailed and 
		sometimes whether or not this was the persons first time in the USA. 
		Similar information (as appropriate) applied where a land border 
		crossing took place. <br><br>The Border Crossing Cards are not always 
		well kept and did contain quite a number of usually fairly minor errors 
		but on the whole they can be very helpful but tracking the appropriate 
		one down is not usually very straight forward. As Alexander may have 
		travelled to Canada and then to USA with his brother James Youngson 
		Thomson, perhaps a search of the cards under James’ name might be 
		productive (in view of the more unusual name) as Alexander probably 
		moved to the USA at the same time.<br><br>I would think the most likely 
		border crossing ports, in order of likelihood, Buffalo, New York or 
		Niagara Falls, New York.<br>
		<br>The above still leaves a mystery to be solved - James P Walsh’s book 
		states that Alexander, James and Annie moved to Canada at the turn of 
		the century and that Alexander and James moved to Chicago about 1907 or 
		1908.<br><br>With reasonable certainty Annie and James can be traced as 
		having gone to Canada on 27th October 1906 but there is no sign of 
		Alexander’s travel until 1909 and this appears to be confirmed in his 
		naturalization papers that also show 1909 as his date of entry to the 
		USA. On the basis of that information Alexander could not have been in 
		the USA in 1906 unless he made a previous trip that has been omitted or 
		incorrectly recorded. This would then raise the question as to who, if 
		anyone, travelled with James to Chicago in 1907 or 1908. Further 
		investigation would be required.<br><br>4. I would treat the 1910 USA 
		Census record with caution (particularly in respect of the immigration 
		year of 1906 which probably only applies to one or more members of the 
		family as some may have arrived at different times).<br><br>5. As mentioned above 
		I have previously found a number of mistakes in Ancestry records and, 
		for example, when I accessed the 1910 USA Census records on Ancestry the 
		preview showed the head of the household as John G Thomson as opposed to 
		the John Y Thomson shown elsewhere although it seems certain that it is 
		the correct entry for the family. <br><br>416-414 W 60th Chicago, 
		Illinois<br><br>I have nothing much to offer on this matter but would 
		make the following observations -<br>a) The date of the marriage was 2nd July 
		1910. This is very close to 4th July 1910 (US Independence Day).<br><br>
		Perhaps this resulted in many people getting married at that time 
		thereby creating difficulties in obtaining a church for the marriage;<br>
		<br>b) The Second United Presbyterian Church in Chicago appears to have 
		had strong links with the Church in Racine (Paul’s birthplace) so he may 
		have been anxious that his wedding take place therein but for the 
		reasons in a) or other he may not have been able to obtain the church 
		itself.<br><br>c) Jean had probably been a member of the Secessionist 
		Church in Scotland which may have had different views from the USA 
		Presbytery that might have prevented them marrying in Church itself.<br><br>d) a) 
		to c) is pretty much conjecture as there is no hard evidence but it was 
		certainly very common practice in Scotland at that time for couples to 
		marry other than in a Church, particularly at a holiday period (ease of 
		work pressures etc) and such weddings usually took place either in one 
		or other of the couples own homes or in the home of a friend or in the 
		office of a Justice of the Peace or a Lawyer authorised to conduct 
		marriages.<br><br>e) I have no definite answer and only further research 
		to find the nature of the building and the occupants would be likely to 
		throw up an answer. Perhaps Street Directories, Voters Registers or 
		whatever other Registers as were available in Chicago might help with 
		the answer.<br><br>

		what was to be Rotary Global History began, the founder, Jack Selway, 
		received a question from a Rotarian, Maureen Bond, then of Zimbabwe. She 
		inquired if we knew anything about Paul Harris' wife, Jean. Not much 
		could be found either at RI or in our files.<br><br>Based on this 
		request we created an entire website, the one you're visiting now, to 
		gather everything that Paul Harris had written. Soon afterward, in 
		searching for material, a young man in Scotland was discovered who had 
		created a section devoted to Jean. <br><br>That was Calum Thomson (no 
		relation) living quite near where Jean Thomson Harris was born. Calum's 
		material became part of this section on Jean. He soon joined Rotary, 
		became chairman of RGHF, president of his own club, and continues to 
		work on Rotary Global History. Another Rotarian, the late Ed Lucas of 
		Edinburgh, Scotland, provided much additional information.<br><br>Now
