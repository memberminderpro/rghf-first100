		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">OBSERVATIONS <br><br>Article 1.<br>Rotary Global 
		History – History Library<br>Article re Jean Thomson Harris’ Parents<br>
		<br>The Extract from 1881 Census is accurate.<br><br>The use of the IGI 
		must always be treated with caution as, in the case of births, it 
		focuses primarily on baptisms and not on actual dates of birth. A 
		baptism can sometimes take place a long time (even years) after the 
		birth. Naturally, in such a case, efforts to tie up subsequent records 
		would be made more difficult.<br><br>In the case of marriages, the 
		recording in the IGI is a bit of a mixture as sometimes the date 
		recorded relates to the Contract to Marry, or the Publication of Banns 
		or the actual date of the Marriage or something else.<br><br>Reference to the actual Old 
		Parish Record at 304/0030 0147 for the birth of John Thomson (spelt 
		Thompson) shows that he was actually born on 13th June 1845 and baptized 
		on 5th July 1845.<br><br>The same record also shows the Birth of John’s 
		sister Ann who was born on 2nd May 1850 and baptized on 5th June 1850.<br>
		<br>The reason why both John and Ann were included in the same record 
		would be because shortly before Statutory Registration became mandatory 
		in Scotland on 1st January 1855, local clergy had a purge on to 
		encourage their parishioners to register births and marriages that had 
		taken place before 1st January 1855 but had not previously been recorded 
		in the Old Parish Records.<br><br>John Thomson and Ann (Youngson) were married on 
		20th June 1873, the place of marriage being 26 Blackfriars Street, 
		Aberdeen, which was the usual residence of Ann. John Thomson’s parents 
		are shown on the 1873 Marriage Certificate. They were David Thomson and 
		Mary Ferguson whose marriage is traced to Old Parish Record 304/0030 
		0091. David and Mary were actually married on 10th December 1842 (and 
		not on 12th November 1842). The date of 12th November 1842, picked up 
		from IGI is probably the date of the Contract to Marry or the date of 
		the Proclamation. They were married at Logie Pert, Forfarshire.<br><br>On 
		the IGI, the birthplace of both John Thomson and Alexander Thomson is 
		shown as St Mary, Edinburgh. Scottish Census Returns show a variety of 
		places in which the Census address is situated, for example, the same 
		Return could show the Civil Parish (which is what St Mary was), School 
		Board Parish, Parliamentary Burgh, Parliamentary Division, Municipal 
		Burgh, Burgh Ward and District and so on. It very much depended on what 
		the transcriber for IGI picks up on. While it is a guide as to where a 
		person is born. I think it is much more preferable to record the 
		District recorded on the actual Birth Certificate itself. In the case of 
		the births of John and Alexander this was the District of St Andrews, 
		Edinburgh.<br><br>Article 2<br>History of Jean Thomson Harris<br>prepared by 
		the late Ed Lucas of The Rotary Club of Edinburgh<br><br>The parents of 
		Jean Thomson were John Thomson (Born 13th June 1845 at Logie Pert, 
		Forfarshire (later Angus) and Ann Youngson (Born 18th May 1851 at 
		Peterhead, Aberdeenshire). As stated above, they were married at 26 
		Blackfriars Street, Aberdeen (Anne’s usual residence) on 20th June 1873.<br>
		<br>Under the section headed “1891” it is stated “ In 1891 the family 
		moved to 33 Cumberland Street”.<br><br>Census Returns only record the 
		people situation at an address at a particular point in time that, in 
		the case of the 1891 Census was 5th April 1891. It cannot be concluded 
		that was the date they moved. In any case between Jane’s (Jean) birth in 
		8th November 1881 and the Census of 5th April 1891, the family appear to 
		have already moved from 9 Cumberland Street, to 15 Cumberland Street, 
		where James Hay Thomson was born on 29th April 1883 and Mary Ferguson 
		Thomson was born on 3rd April 1886 and then moved to 33 Cumberland 
		Street sometime between that date and the Census on 5th April 1891.<br>
		<br>The son James and the daughter Mary are shown on the 1891 Census on 
		which they are referred to as scholars.<br><br>Under the heading “1892” 
		reference is made to a flat at 81 Comely Bank Avenue, Avenue.<br><br>On 
		the 1901 Census the family are shown as residing at 41 Comely Bank 
		Avenue, Edinburgh. Although it is possible that some renumbering of the 
		houses or the flats had taken place, it seems probable that they in fact 
		moved from 33 Cumberland Street sometime after the birth of daughter 
		Joanna on 28th April 1891 to 41 Comely Bank Avenue and not to 81 Comely 
		Bank Avenue as it is 41 that appears on the 1901 Census.<br><br>There is 
		always the possibility that they had more than one change of address 
		before moving to 41 Comely Bank Avenue but I have seen no reference to 
		Number 81 Comely Bank Avenue on official records. This may be able to be 
		confirmed by reference to Edinburgh Street Directories or Voters Rolls.<br>
		<br>Jean is referred to as a Dressmaker in the 1901 Census.<br><br>Her 
		elder sister is now referred to as Annie Moir Thomson (Moir being the 
		maiden surname of Ann Youngson (Annie’s mother).<br><br>Jean’s brothers 
		John Youngson Thomson (referred to as a Law Clerk) and James Hay Thomson 
		(referred to as an Apprentice Upholsterer) are also included in the 1901 
		Census as are Jean (still referred to by her christened name of Jane) 
		(and still referred to as a Dressmaker) and her other two sisters Mary 
		Ferguson (referred to as an Apprentice Dressmaker) (Ferguson being the 
		family name of the wife of David Thomson (the father of John Thomson) 
		and Joanna Lawrence Thomson (who is referred to as a Scholar<br><br>
		Reference is made to the probability (or possibility) that Jean and her 
		siblings attended St Bernards School in Dean Park Street in Edinburgh. 
		John Youngson Thomson attended Canonmills Primary School, Rodney Street, 
		Edinburgh and thereafter James Gillespies School located in Gillespie 
		Crescent (formerly Bruntsfield Links). The later was a fee-paying school 
		for boys and girls.<br><br>When he registered with 
		James Gillespies School on 20th September 1887 his home address was 15 
		Cumberland Street, Edinburgh. Accordingly, sometime between that date 
		and the Census on 5th April 1891 the family moved to 33 Cumberland 
		Street, Edinburgh.<br><br>He then attended Edinburgh University before 
		he qualified as a Solicitor in October 1905.<br><br>I have examined the 
		school records for James Gillespie and located John’s attendance thereat 
		but it seems unlikely that any of the other siblings attended that 
		school.<br><br>Likewise the records of the Law Society for Scotland may 
		contain references to John’s schooling. I shall possibly investigate 
		that aspect in due course.<br><br>Under the section “1905”<br>Jean’s brother John 
		Youngson Thomson was, in addition to being a Minister at Leith, also a 
		minister at Greenock before taking up a Ministry at Annbank in Ayrshire.<br>
		<br>He was not the Chaplain to the Moderator of the General Assembly of 
		the Church of Scotland in 1931.<br><br>He was, however, Chaplain to John 
		Brown, the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church 
		of Scotland in 1931, which is a totally different office to that of 
		Chaplain to the Moderator. The duties of the two offices are totally 
		different<br><br>It is noted that no reference has been made in this 
		article to the second child David who was born to John Thomson and Ann 
		Youngson:<br><br>David Thomson was born on 15/9/1875 and died on 
		6/11/1880 (of scarletina)<br><br>I have not dealt with the subsequent 
		sections of the article from1910 to 1963.<br><br>Article 3<br>
		Article by the late Ed Lucas about Jean Thomson Harris<br>A brief 
		history of her life in Scotland<br><br>See above observations re Ed 
		Lucas Article<br><br>Article 4<br>Rotary 
		Global History Fellowship<br>Article about the meeting on 5th May 2006 
		between Cal Thomson and Rob Knueppler<br><br>As stated above, in the observations to 
		the first section about Ed Lucas’ Article, the family appear to have 
		resided at 41 Comely Bank Avenue in 1901 and I have not, at present, 
		found any official reference to it being 81(although some re-numbering 
		may have taken place.<br><br>It would appear therefore that the 
		reference in the Article to No 81 being the childhood home of Jean is 
		incorrect and that James Walsh got it right, at 41, in his biography of 
		“Paul Harris-The First Rotarian”<br><br>Article 5<br>Rotary Global History 
		Fellowship<br>Women and Rotary<br>1928 Article headed “Jean Thomson 
		Harris”<br><br>Jane Thomson was born on 8th November 1881.<br><br>Jane 
		Thomson and Paul P Harris married on 2nd July 1910. It is stated in the 
		Article that Jean and Paul met three months before this, that is about 
		April 1910 and that three years prior to that time Jean had come with 
		her brothers and sisters to this country (USA) from Edinburgh, Scotland, 
		indicating 1907 or thereby. Jane Thomson is known to have emigrated to 
		Canada on 29th June 1907, which would fit in with them going to USA in 
		1907. The remainder of the family appear to have gone later.<br><br>
		According to this Article, Jean’s “eyes first opened to the light of 
		day” in Comely Bank (probably a bit of poetic licence). This is 
		incorrect as she was born at 9 Cumberland Street, St Andrew, Edinburgh 
		on 8th November 1881 and only moved to 41 Comely Bank Avenue, St 
		Bernards, Edinburgh after 28th April 1891 by which time she was at least 
		nine years of age.<br><br>Article 6<br>First Woman in Rotary by 
		Laura Pitt<br>It would appear that this has been written from personal 
		reminiscences and hearsay of Laura Pitt whose father was the cousin of 
		Paul Harris. As such there appears to be a number of inaccuracies 
		herein. The Article should, I feel, be treated with caution as to the 
		accuracy of the information therein:<br><br>It is said that Jim 
		(presumably James Hay Thomson) emigrated to America, He appears to have 
		first emigrated to Canada on 27th October 1906 and presumably thereafter 
		moved to America.<br><br>John Youngson Thomson (born 29th July 1877) 
		emigrated to Canada on 17th September 1909 and later moved to Chicago. 
		Mother and Father John Thomson, Mother Anne Thomson (nee Youngson) and 
		daughter Joanna (Joey) Lawrence Thomson moved to New York, USA on 28th 
		May 1910 probably in time for the marriage of Jean to Paul Harris 0n 2nd 
		July 1910.<br><br>The chronology and facts etc appears to be inaccurate 
		in a number of instances.<br><br>Article 7<br>Extract from The 
		Founder of Rotary- Paul P Harris 1928<br><br>In Part 1V “A wife and a 
		Home”<br>it is stated that Jean’s “eyes first opened to the light of 
		day” in Comely Bank. This is incorrect as she was born at 9 Cumberland 
		Street, St Andrew, Edinburgh on 8th November 1881 and only moved to 41 
		Comely Bank Avenue, St Bernards, Edinburgh after 28th April 1891.<br>
		<br>The above misstatement appears to have been revised in “This 
		Rotarian Age” 1935<br>which states “It has been named Comely Bank” after 
		the street in Edinburgh where<br>it’s mistress was raised”<br><br>Ian H
