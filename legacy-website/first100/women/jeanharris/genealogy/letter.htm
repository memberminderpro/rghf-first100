		Founder<br>30 May 2008&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">Dear Jack,<br><br>I refer you to 
		our previous Email correspondence, particularly that of September 2007.<br><br>For quite a while I have been investigating 
		the Genealogy of Jean Harris and think it is appropriate that I submit 
		what I have at the present time.<br><br>When investigating the Genealogy 
		of a particular person, several decisions have to be taken at the outset 
		and parameters set, including, for example,<br><br>1. The Lines to be 
		investigated. Basically, each person has two lines, the Paternal and the 
		Maternal, but each of them, in turn has two Lines, namely two sets for 
		our Grandparents. Each of our Grandparents has, in turn, two sets for 
		our Great Grandparents and so on. The number of lines, therefore, keeps 
		growing.<br><br>In the same way, the number of Lines in a forward 
		direction grows, for example, our children, who marry (or not) and have 
		children of their own. Each of these events introduces several other 
		lines, for example, their spouses. It is almost endless.<br><br>2. The 
		use to which the research is to be put There is, in my view, very little 
		to be achieved by simply collecting names and dates. You can, however, 
		advance your researches by sometimes working “outside the box” and in 
		this way, you can often uncover information that you would not otherwise 
		do.<br><br>In my present researches of Jean’s Genealogy, I have recorded 
		276 names with relevant information, including forward information.<br><br>I thought the main purposes of researching the 
		genealogy of Jean would be to:<br>· Present the family background on a 
		purely factual basis without any fanciful narrative.<br>· Ascertain if 
		there was any evidence of any relatives (who were not too distantly 
		related) still being alive, as that might help uncover further 
		information, documentation, photographs etc.<br><br>Previous Researches<br>
		<br>Various persons have previously carried out some research into 
		Jean’s background but, unfortunately, this does always appear to have 
		produced totally accurate results. Most, if not all, of this appears in 
		the Fellowship Web Pages.<br><br>I am of the view that it would be wise to 
		correct the various inaccuracies in these so that conflicting 
		information is not shown. I have no great knowledge of the mechanics of 
		producing Web Pages or the legalities thereof but, if it is possible, I 
		think the best course of action would be to amend or withdraw the 
		original Pages but if that is not possible, then to post a new Page with 
		“Errors and Corrections to Jean Harris Pages”.<br><br>I am attaching, at 
		Schedule T-4, a Schedule of “Observations on items already posted on 
		Global History Website”. This shows some identified inaccuracies.<br><br>Previous researches<br><br>This seems to have 
		concentrated mainly on Jean’s Paternal Line.<br><br>Present research<br>
		<br>I thought it appropriate to look at both the Paternal and the 
		Maternal Lines going as far back a possible at the present time.<br><br>I have 
		therefore produced Schedule T-2 with Charts of those both Paternal and 
		Maternal Descendants Lines with more detailed information relative 
		thereto.<br><br>As is usually the case there are areas where complete 
		information has not yet been obtained but if we wait until all the gaps 
		are filled, we will never produce any results, as research is usually an 
		ongoing process.<br><br>Schedule T-2 covers Generations 1 to 5 of both 
		the Paternal and Maternal lines.<br><br>In addition, I followed these 
		through to Generations 6 and 7 at Schedule T-3 in respect of the only 
		sibling of Jean known to have had children, that is, Joanna (aka Joey).<br>
		<br>I am attaching a copy of that Schedule for the retention of the 
		Fellowship.<br><br>However, I do not think that it would be appropriate 
		to publish that Schedule, as the sensitivities and privacy of the 
		parties concerned, some of whom are probably still alive or have issue 
		still alive, should be respected and protected.<br><br>Possible Outcomes<br>
		<br>The information obtained in these Schedules and other data gathered 
		could be helpful in trying to establish whether any of the parties 
		concerned are still alive and whether they might have any information in 
		the form of letters, certificates, family Bibles, photographs etc that 
		might relate to Jean or Paul or any other family members.<br><br>I think 
		this is worthwhile pursuing although at the end of the day we might find 
		very little or, indeed, nothing. On the other hand we just might uncover 
		a treasure trove. I don’t know whether anyone has previously attempted 
		to check out this aspect but if you would like me to pursue it further, 
		I would be happy to do so.<br><br>Ongoing<br><br>You asked me to 
		“mentor” you in relation to Jean.<br><br>Certain aspects of Jean’s personal life 
		seem to have been garnered from reminiscences of various people and from 
		the Journals of her travels with Paul but, so far as I am aware, these 
		have not been gathered into a comprehensive article.<br><br>One of the 
		best Articles is that entitled “Jean Thomson Harris” produced by Ed 
		Lucas of the Rotary Club of Edinburgh, although subject to the 
		reservations contained in Schedule T-4 attached hereto.<br><br>Jean 
		seems to have been a remarkable lady and I feel that this aspect, 
		although difficult to investigate, might be worth pursuing. This would 
		perhaps seem to fall into three areas:<br><br>1. Her life in Scotland 
		prior to her departure to USA<br>I may find something, if we pursue “surviving 
		relatives”<br>Perhaps Callum could pursue this section or suggest 
		someone local to Edinburgh who could do so? Subsections might include, 
		education, work, church-going and social activities.<br><br>2. Her life 
		in the USA/Canada prior to her marriage and thereafter including her 
		travels with Paul.<br><br>I would think that a Chicagoan with an 
		interest in Genealogy would be best for this. Perhaps someone could be 
		recruited from one or more of the Chicago Clubs?<br><br>Subsections 
		might include her places of residence and work, church-going and social 
		activities.<br><br>3. Her life after returning to Scotland from the USA
		<br><br>This would be similar research as for item 1 above plus 
		establishment of her places of residence other than those already found.<br>
		<br>There would be a lot of work involved in trying to find each of the 
		above and I would recommend that it only be undertaken if the Fellowship 
		feels that it would be of sufficient interest to Rotarians.<br><br>
		Personally, I feel that the Article by Ed Lucas is sufficient, subject 
		to the minor adjustments that I have suggested elsewhere in Schedule T4. 
		That Article together with my paper on the Genealogical Aspects 
		(Schedule T2) would, in my view, give the Membership sufficient 
		information regarding Jean. I would however suggest that the two papers 
		would be better shown together on a separate page of the Website.<br>
		<br>I hope that the foregoing is of interest.<br><br>Yours in Rotary<br>
