		Biography composed of the memories as recorded by one who knew her as 
		few others could have – Paul P. Harris.<br><br>Having spent one year 
		working for George Clark, whom Paul refers to as his employer-chum, he 
		decided it was time to move on having spent that year with the purpose 
		of saving money for future adventures. <br><br>According to Paul:<br>As 
		the twelve-months’ period was drawing to a close, Paul notified George 
		of his intended departure. George answered: “Is there no where else you 
		care to go?” Paul answered: “Yes, there is one more place, but I doubt 
		your willingness to send me.”<br><br>“Where is it?” inquired George.<br>
		<br>“Europe,” said Paul.<br><br>Two weeks later the wanderer was once 
		again on high seas, under orders of his employer-chum, to visit the 
		granite-producing regions of Scotland, and the marble-producing regions 
		of Ireland, Belgium, and Italy for the purpose of revising arrangements 
		for buying the products of foreign quarries.<br><br>He visited 
		Edinburgh. Fourteen years prior thereto, there had been born to John and 
		Annie Thomson, in that classic city, their fifth child, a girl, bonny, 
		bright-eyed Jean. Her mother says that during the course of her very 
		first breakfast, Jean looked up inquiringly into her mother’s eyes and 
		then settled back as if content. The confidential relationship then and 
		there established has continued through life. Paul was at the time of 
		his visit to Edinburgh of course oblivious to the fact that the future 
		Mrs. Paul was one of “Jock Tamson’s eight bairns”; he was in truth 
		ignorant to the existence of such a family.<br><br>The children of John 
		and Annie Thomson were deeply grounded in the religion of Calvin and 
		Knox. It was a rigorous training, one which could not fail to constitute 
		a powerful influence on after life.<br><br>On holidays, John and Annie 
		were wont to take their children to the sea shore’ all, except the 
		youngest, walking, though the distance covered frequently amounted to 
		several miles.<br><br>The baby Joey rode in the “pram” which was pushed 
		by the parents and by the children in turn. When the distances were 
		great, Mary or another of the younger children was also given a life in 
		the “pram.” Small wonder that the sight of rolling billows, the sniff of 
		salt air bring tender memories to Jean’ that they remind her of the 
		sacred days of childhood spent in the companionship of father, mother, 
		brothers and sisters. The meeting of Jean with Paul will be described 
		later.<br><br>*****<br><br>Having retained his love of country rambles, 
		Paul became a charter member of the Prairie Club of Chicago when it was 
		organized in 1907. He credits that organization with having provided him 
		with the opportunity to obtain both a wife and a home to his liking. In 
		company with other members he spent his Saturday afternoons, whenever 
		possible, hiking over the country contiguous to Chicago. He had a 
		special fondness for the sand dunes on the Indiana shore of Lake 
		Michigan and there he spent many days and nights renewing his strength 
		and enjoying the outdoors.<br><br>One Saturday afternoon in mid-winter 
		he was hiking with friends in the Beverly Hills-Morgan Park district 
		when he chanced to see several boys coasting down a hill. The scene 
		reminded him so vividly of his boyhood days in Vermont that it seemed to 
		him that he would like some day to have a home there.<br><br>
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/jeanharris/images/harriswedding.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style25" height="261" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/jeanharris/images/harriswedding_small.jpg" style="float: left" width="247"></a>A 
		little later, while on a Saturday afternoon hike, he met Jean, 
		heretofore referred to, as the fifth bairn of John and Annie Thomson, 
		who three years prior thereto had come with her brothers and sisters to 
		this country from Edinburgh, Scotland. Within three months from the date 
		of that meeting, Jean became Mrs. Paul Harris and two years later he 
		placed her in a home of her own on the top of the wooded hill, having 
		christened [named] the place “Comely Bank” in honor of the street in 
		beautiful Edinburgh where Jean’s eyes first opened to the light of day. 
		It will be observed that Paul internationalized his family before 
		internationalizing Rotary, thus manifesting the possession of sporting 
		blood and of his willingness to take his own medicine. He hopes that the 
		international character of his marriage with Jean may prove to be a good 
		omen for Rotary.<br><br>Two women have exercised strong influences upon 
		Paul; the one was his grandmother, and the other, his wife.<br><br>Paul’s Scotch lassie recognizes the fact 
		that loyalty is owing the country of her adoption but the bagpipe still 
		sets her toes tingling and the strains of “Annie Laurie” send the 
		crimson blood surging to her cheeks. True to the traditions of her 
		ancestors she permits no cause which she deems worthy to go undefended, 
		and she can mobilize her spiritual forces in a second’s time. Alleged 
		Scotch parsimony in conspicuous in its absence from the heart of bonnie 
		Jean.<br><br>As an illustration of her unselfish and impulsive nature, 
		an incident of her childhood may be related.<br><br>She had constituted 
		herself protector as well as friend of a crippled playmate. Together 
		they walked to school, Jean helping her over rough places. The school 
		was considerable distance from home and the children were therefore 
		provided with money with which to buy their noon day lunches.<br><br>On one 
		occasion, after having loitered along the way, they discovered that they 
		were late, too late for the crippled child. Jean asked her if she had a 
		penny to which she answered, no. In an instant Jean thought of her own 
		lunch money, unhesitatingly stopped a tram, bundled her charge aboard, 
		thrust the penny into her hand and they bounded along the street waving 
		encouragement. They arrived at school on time though the expenditure 
		made it necessary for Jean to fast that day. The immortal Flora 
		Macdonald could not have done more. Jean is ever so, throwing herself 
		with perfect abandon into every breach to which love or duty calls.<br>
		<br>Her militant spirit has been made manifest on occasions without 
		number. It is ever present, in fact, waiting only the call for action. 
		This quality of mind and heart was made painfully manifest one day to 
		the driver of a team of horses which he was brutally belaboring with his 
		whip in an attempt to surmount a slippery hill. He will not soon forget 
		the dressing down he received from the excited and belligerent little 
		girl who appeared upon the scene in unexpected manner. Jean’s impetuous 
		espousal of needy causes and her disposition to throw herself into them 
		has been the occasion of a good deal of worry to Paul, particularly when 
		she happens to be called to the city. His mind is never at rest until 
		she is seated in the suburban train bound for their home in the country. 
		He fears that her sense of duty may prompt her to disregard her own 
		safety. Jean is essentially a home girl, a lover of good books and of 
		the wholesome things of life. She and Paul spend their evenings, as a 
		rule, in “Comely Bank,” reading together. When it is Paul’s turn to 
		read, Jean’s busy fingers fashion garments for the fatherless babes that 
		are born at Cook County hospital. She has made hundreds of such garments 
		during the course of years. Had Jean been a different type, Paul’s 
		course could not have been as it was. In her way she has made material 
		though inconspicuous contribution to the cause of Rotary.<br><br>During 
		the past two years Paul and Jean have visited Rotary Clubs in all parts 
		of the United States, in Bermuda, Mexico and Cuba.<br><br>Two years ago, 
		the board of directors of Rotary International, passed a resolution in 
		favor of extending them an invitation to make an around the world trip 
		in the interests of the movement. It was not practical at the time to 
		accept but it is not improbably that the journey will be made in the not 
		far distant future.<br><br>The above text is excerpted from The Founder 
		of Rotary, Paul P. Harris, by Paul P. Harris, published by Rotary 
		International, Chicago Illinois, 1928.</td>
