		enjoyed all aspects of history, so it wasn't surprising that in early 
		2010 my interest grew in the direction of learning more about the 
		history of&nbsp;Women and Rotary. I had heard many presentations by RIP 
		1992/93&nbsp;Cliff Dochterman&nbsp;on the History of Rotary while living in 
		California, but little about women and Rotary. I researched online and 
		spoke with many individuals involved with history such as&nbsp;Doug Rudman, 
		Jack M. B. Selway, Sandra Myers, Basil Lewis, Sandra Duck&nbsp; 
		worth&nbsp;and numerous club historians&nbsp; 
		in&nbsp;Duarte,&nbsp;Minneapolis,&nbsp;Duluth&nbsp;and&nbsp;Seattle. <br><br>PDG Sandra Duckworth 
		had done a PowerPoint presentation back in 2008 titled the Mouse that 
		Roared&nbsp; for a District 7620 Conference and got much of the 
		information from the Rotary Global History Fellowship internet sight. 
		The slides and the script enabled me to expand on that history as well 
		as update the PowerPoint presentation in time for the 25th Anniversary 
		of Women and Rotary in 2012.<br><br>While working on the presentation, 
		it occurred to me that a video of the first woman president of a Rotary 
		club as well as the first women District Governors would add greatly to 
		the collection of history. Please note, this was coming from a total 
		amateur who mostly video taped grandkids. A passion for history and 
		meeting these trailblazing women took charge. I also added all&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/trustees/index.htm">first 
		women Trustees of RI/TRF</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/directors/index.htm">first 
		women Directors</a>. My vision was far reaching but the logistics proved 
		to be difficult.<br><br>

		first contacted&nbsp;Sylvia Whitlock&nbsp;and the first women DG's from 1995 
		(Gilda Chirafisi,&nbsp;Reba Lovrien,Virginia Nordby,&nbsp;Anne Robertson,&nbsp;Olive 
		Scott&nbsp;and&nbsp;Janet Holland). My online search indicated that&nbsp;Donna Rapp&nbsp;was 
		deceased.&nbsp;Imagine my surprise when I found her alive and kicking!&nbsp;She 
		also happens to be the youngest member of the group. Mimi Altman was the 
		8th DG and she was deceased. I obtained information about her daughter, 
		an active Rotarian also named Mimi Altman, and I was able to include her 
		in my project.<br><br>My plan was to meet up with Sylvia, Gilda and 
		Janet at the RI Convention in New Orleans in May, 2012. I was able to 
		interview and develop a script with all three of them and video Sylvia, 
		but the space for the video taping at the Convention Center proved 
		inadequate. <br><br>

		next plan was to try to bring all the women together for what might be 
		called a reunion. The venue was the District 7750 Convention being held 
		at Hilton Head in March of 2012 with an emphasis on the History of Women 
		and Rotary for the 25th Anniversary of women in Rotary. Sylvia was a 
		keynote speaker and 5 of the 7 women DG’s attended and made up a panel 
		discussion. All were presented with awards by District Governor Gary 
		Goforth to acknowledge their achievements within Rotary. A hospitality 
		suite was provided for the women to visit and to prepare scripts for the 
		video taping. Del Hickey, Aiken Rotary, SC, assisted with the room and 
		the panel discussion. A video tape of Sylvia’s keynote and the panel 
		discussion was made at the Conference. That left two past DG’s and all 
		the Trustees and Directors to complete the project.<br><br>

		contacted the Trustees and Directors but only heard back from two of 
		them. Their schedules were extremely busy and it was difficult to 
		coordinate a meeting. I also contacted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/firstrip/index.htm">Nan 
		McCreadie</a>&nbsp;in Great Britain (president in 2013/14 of RIBI) and 
		arranged to meet her at the RI General Assembly in San Diego in 2013. I 
		was in hopes of doing many of the women at this event, but it did not 
		work out so I cancelled my trip. In the meantime, one of the past DG's I 
		interviewed advised me that it would be better to video tape them after 
		they completed their years in office. It was easier to be open and 
		candid after the fact. I decided that may be true and decided to skip 
		the Trustees and Directors. It is with great sorrow that I missed&nbsp;Betsy 
		Demaray,&nbsp;Director and first woman RI Treasurer, now deceased, as we did 
		try to coordinate a meeting. (There is a ten minute video of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/directors/demaray.htm">Betsy 
		Demaray</a>,&nbsp;on her page, speaking from the US White House.&nbsp;<br><br>

		left two past DG's plus Mimi Altman, the daughter. Mimi drove up from 
		Chicago and we met in Racine, Wisconsin in the summer of 2012 and did 
		her video taping at the home of a friend. Since she was hauled to Rotary 
		District Conferences as a baby through the growing up years and is 
		currently an active Rotarian, she may hold the record (by age) for 
		attendance. In the video, she shares that her grandfather was good 
		friends of Paul Harris and her mother was bounced on his knee more than 
		once.&nbsp;<br><br>While in Wisconsin, I video taped&nbsp;Pat Jenkins, Executive 
		Director of the Madison Downtown Club of 550 members. She had been in 
		this position for a number of years then became a member when women were 
		allowed in Rotary. She is still the Executive Director of the club. I 
		also interviewed and planned to tape what I thought might be the first 
		couple in the same Rotary Club, again in the Madison Club, Judge Andrea 
		Bartell and Jeff Bartell. She joined as one of the first women in the 
		club right after the Supreme Court decision and her husband had been a 
		member for years. I am yet to do the video as I don't know if they are 
		the â€˜first'. I drove to Ann Arbor, Michigan in September of 2012 and 
		video taped Virginia Nordby, then in November I met Anne Robertson in 
		Nashville, Tennessee.<br><br>Then came the task of editing. That was 
		completed in January of 2013 with the assistance of my brother, Art 
		Farwell and sent along with release forms to Jack Selway at RGHF. The 
		PowerPoint presentation is currently being updated to reflect changes in 
		Directors and will require future updating as women are selected for 
		positions at RI. The PowerPoint does not lend itself well to be put 
		online at RGHF, but a summary will appear on the sight and is available 
		for presentations.<br><br>So, this labor of love has come to a close, at 
		least temporarily. I am still in hopes of video taping the women 
		Trustees and the Directors and Nan McCreadie of RIBI at some time in the 
		future. My appreciation goes out to the many Rotarians that assisted me 
		in this project and the Rotary Women that have touched my life forever.</td>
