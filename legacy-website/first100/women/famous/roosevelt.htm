		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">In the April 1940 issue of The 
		Rotarian, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt wrote an article, complete with 
		almost a dozen photographs, to increase America’s consciousness about 
		the ravages of the Great Depression, which were still affecting many 
		Americans. Obviously, her article referred to a major “New Deal” 
		program, the WPA (Works Projects Administration). President Franklin 
		Delano Roosevelt was at the end of his second term in office (he would 
		be elected for four terms, but die in office) and the administration was 
		still trying everything they could to end the Depression. <br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/famous/images/ad40.jpg" style="float: left">Rotary, 
		and the Rotarian, were more than happy to extend to the administration 
		and Eleanor Roosevelt all courtesies, as it was in everyone’s interest 
		to recover from the economic problems that still plagued the United 
		States, almost nine years after the October 29 stock market crash. 
		Rotary gave the “power of the press” to FDR efforts, and, less than two 
		years later, when America was dragged into World War II, Rotary was 
		encouraged to keep meeting and get involved, and Rotary responded, 
		primarily with War Bond sales. While she wasn’t the first woman to be 
		closely identified with Rotary, Jean Harris and Lillian Davidson being 
		two important examples, Eleanor Roosevelt was one of the most important. 
		Her article appears here in its entirety. <br><br>Eleanor Roosevelt on:<br>
		<br><strong>Helping Them to Help Themselves</strong><br><br>Eleanor 
		Roosevelt, from a PBS American Experience TV programSOME of us who have 
		been going around America are impressed with the fact that one type of 
		organization might possibly be a real help in carrying people through 
		hard times without needing so much Government assistance. It requires, 
		however, a consciousness on the part of the whole community that there 
		are difficulties to be solved and a willingness to set its shoulders to 
		the wheel and help to solve them. The particular activity I have in mind 
		is the self-help cooperative. To many people that is just a name and 
		means very little, but to some people, it means the preservation of 
		self-respect, the development of a new skill or the practice of an old 
		one, and a chance to start out again with a background of security.<br>
		<br>The first self-help cooperative that I remember hearing much about 
		was the one established in Richmond, Virginia. The principle of the 
		self-help cooperative is that anyone, old or young, if he has need to do 
		so, may come in and work, and that his work hours will be exchanged for 
		scrip which can, in turn, be exchanged for commodities and services 
		performed by others, also members of the cooperative. In 1938 in the 
		Richmond Citizens' Service Exchange, 211,300 hours were worked by the 
		members. For this work, scrip was issued to the workers and they 
		exchanged it for food, clothing, shoes, bedding and fuel wood.<br><br>In 
		some places even shelter may be provided in this way, and frequently 
		beauty-parlor work and barbering are done. In order to do this, all 
		these activities must be carried on in the exchange, which means, for 
		instance, that if you have a man who is capable of being a baker, you 
		must give him a bake oven and the material for making bread. So the 
		community must be conscious enough of the need to furnish the bake oven 
		and the materials for bread. The baker, in return for his hours of 
		labor, may want to buy a suit. Some other person who gets his bread in 
		the exchange will have spent his hours of labor in repairing, cleaning, 
		and pressing a suit which somebody in the community has not needed and 
		has therefore turned in to the self-help cooperative to be renovated for 
		someone who does need it. You see you cannot start a self-help 
		cooperative with nothing.<br><br>The more things the people who come in 
		are able to do, the more things you have to get from the community in 
		order to enable them to go to work. For example, if you have good 
		laundry workers, somebody has to donate laundry machinery; if you have 
		people who know how to make and upholster furniture, somebody has to 
		donate the necessary machinery. But in the end these people who work in 
		the exchange do not suffer from the stigma of being unemployed and on 
		relief.<br><br>USA Work Program logoOf course, on the Works Projects 
		Administration (WPA) there should be no sense of stigma, because one 
		gives work in return for what he gets, but I am sorry to say that in 
		many places I have found deep resentment at the attitude of those who 
		interview WPA workers. On the other side of the picture, there is a 
		resentment on the part of many people toward the WPA worker, which 
		prevents him from getting a job on the outside, which he could 
		frequently fill and would give a great deal to obtain.<br><br>IN THE 
		self-help cooperative these feelings are not present. What is furnished 
		by the community is usually material which would otherwise be wasted, 
		and, except in the case of money granted by the Government or by some 
		other source to pay for trained supervision or for certain definite 
		expenses which cannot be eliminated, there is very little direct tax in 
		the way of cash taken from the taxpayer.<br><br>The Richmond Citizens' 
		Service Exchange served as a model for the establishment in Washington, 
		D. C., of a self-help exchange, though it has developed differently to 
		fit the needs of a different community. In 1939 this exchange gave work 
		to between 600 and 680 people a month. In 1939, 422,554 hours of work 
		were provided. It is interesting to see the ways in which those workers 
		spent the scrip earned: 181,524 pieces were spent for meals and bread; 
		103,553 pieces for clothing and such household supplies as sheets, 
		towels, and table linen; 27,354 for furniture and furniture repair; 
		15,884 for fuel; 13,023 for shoe repair; 10,547 for barbering and 
		beauty-shop services.<br><br>In that list of scrip spent, which 
		represents hours of labor, is the tale of the possibility of getting a 
		new job. If you can get something to eat, even if it is not entirely 
		adequate, if you can get new clothes and have your shoes repaired, and 
		go to a barber or a hairdresser, you can start again on the job-hunting 
		business in the frame of mind, which gets a job. Self-help, like WPA, is 
		something to tide us over until the nations of this world solve their 
		economic problems and recognize the fact that no civilization can 
		possibly survive which does not furnish every individual who wishes to 
		work a job at wages on which he can live decently.<br><br>I grew up in 
		an era when I remember hearing many people say with some contempt that 
		this or that individual felt the world owed him a living. The idea was 
		that the individual in question was unwilling to work and that, 
		therefore, society had no obligations toward him. I am inclined to agree 
		with the idea, but we are up against a different problem now.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="233" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/famous/images/ad32.jpg" style="float: left" width="297">Most 
		of the people who are out of work are ready and willing to work. You and 
		I can pick-out, of course, individuals who like to live on other 
		people's labor and who perhaps have to be forced to work. The great 
		majority of people who are not ill or too old are ready and anxious to 
		work, however, and in this curiously complicated civilization, which we 
		have created through the centuries, there is no work for them to do. We 
		ought to change that old saying and say that a civilization and an 
		economic system which does not recognize its responsibility to answer 
		this question of how work at a living wage can be furnished every 
		individual, should be held in as great contempt as we used to hold the 
		individual who had the attitude that he could go through life 
		effortlessly and expect the world to look after him.<br><br>The 
		self-help cooperative has no use for anyone who is not willing to do a 
		good day's work, but the cooperative has this advantage- every age is 
		served alike. In different parts of the United States self-help has been 
		a spontaneous response of workers to prolonged unemployment. Both in 
		Richmond and in Washington, D. C., it was initiated by people who saw 
		that it might solve certain difficulties and wished to make a 
		demonstration of what could be done; so that in these two instances it 
		has not sprung up so clearly from the people themselves. <br><br>I have 
		seen it, however, with curious vitality, spring up in places where you 
		would expect to find utter discouragement and loss of all initiative. 
		Such things as this have happened: unemployed workers have borrowed idle 
		tractors and asked near-by farmers if they would take their labor for 
		unsold potatoes. It is just going back to the early days of America and 
		using mother wit and neighborliness to keep alive.<br><br>During the 
		last seven years, for the first time, these sporadic efforts of idle 
		workers have been systematized and certain precise economic aims and 
		definite techniques of operation have been worked out, and in certain of 
		these the Government has supplied funds with which to buy necessary 
		tools; Self-help cooperatives should be looked upon as a protection for 
		industrial workers who are subject to the present extremes which require 
		in many industries at times a maximum of employment and at other times 
		throwing great numbers of people back on their own resources. In another 
		field, the Farm Security Administration, an effort has been made to help 
		the small farmer provide himself with a broad base of real income by 
		expanding his productive activities so as to supplement his cash income 
		in good years and in bad years to make him more self-sustaining.<br><br>
		THE LAST Government grants to these self-help cooperatives were made in 
		1936, and 125 exchanges are still in existence and going strong. The 
		essential activities are always the production of food, the cutting of 
		fuel wood, and the making of clothing, but many other things have been 
		done in different parts of the country, such as dairying, poultry 
		raising, fishing, plumbing, carpentry, baking, operating cafeterias and 
		beauty shops, and repairing automobiles, radios, and shoes.<br><br>The 
		Barter Theater in Abingdon, Virginia, was based on much the same barter 
		idea which furnished the springboard for nearly all self-help 
		cooperatives, and have never forgotten a delightful story I heard told 
		at a luncheon a year ago by Robert Porterfield. He told of looking out 
		of the window and seeing a man and his wife and a cow standing outside 
		the theater. Shortly the man came in and inquired how much milk would be 
		needed for a ticket to the show. He was told and went out and brought 
		the milk in. Mr. Porterfield asked if the farmer's wife was not to be 
		allowed to attend also, and he answered, &quot;Sure, but I ain't doing her 
		milking for her.&quot;<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/famous/images/ae89.jpg" style="float: left">So 
		you see, everybody must do his own work, but the cooperative spirit, 
		which underlies the whole movement, is valuable education for a 
		democracy. Every day you work you realize that you cannot work for 
		yourself alone, but all the other workers must be producing too in order 
		that you may barter for what you wish and need. The more you help the 
		others, the more you really gain yourself. Good doctrine to inculcate in 
		the citizens of a great democracy!<br><br>It seems foolish to have to 
		repeat that the cooperative does not compete with factory production, 
		but it is necessary to say so over and over again apparently. Industry 
		has at times been fearful lest these self-help groups might become a 
		menace, but, after all, they need these workers at times and they need 
		workers who have skills and who are accustomed to work with good 
		equipment.<br><br>IN A WAY, the running of a self-help exchange is 
		insurance for industry that its workers will not come back rusty and 
		have to be reeducated in their work when they are needed. What they 
		produce in the exchange is for consumption among themselves. With no 
		income they could not buy from the outside. If they were not working in 
		the exchange, they would be a complete charge upon the community. <br>
		<br>This would not perhaps be serious if it meant that you could take 
		care of them through relief in the cheapest way possible for a short 
		time and that then they would return at the call of industry to their 
		usual jobs, but that is not what happens as a rule. If they are idle, 
		they are underfed. Their families lack food, a decent home, and a chance 
		for recreation, and so disintegration begins. A young criminal may 
		develop in a family, which has never had that kind of a blot before; 
		some of the children may develop tuberculosis. When a worker is called 
		back. His background, his own condition, unfits him to be of any value.<br>
		<br>This is the thing, which too few people think about, when they count 
		the cost of giving men and women work in self-help exchanges or even on 
		WPA or any place, which is not the usual form of employment in either 
		urban or rural localities.<br><br>I do not see how it is possible to 
		study the results of the self-help exchanges without being anxious to 
		see this work supported and extended. True, there have been some 
		failures, frequently because of lack of leadership or lack of knowledge 
		on the part of the community or group working out their particular 
		community problem. We need to give more study and thought to helping 
		people to help themselves, and that is why I hope that communities all 
		over the United States will take an interest in self-help cooperatives.<br>
		<br>To learn more about Eleanor Roosevelt's writing and the &quot;New Deal&quot; 
		additional photos, this article and much more.<br><br>Hear Mrs. 
		Roosevelt speak, (<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/famous/images/speech_425.ram">Real 
		Player file</a>)<br><br><strong>&quot;The only way to obtain peace in the 
		world is to work cooperatively toward that end.&quot;</strong> (April 6, 
		1937)<br><br>In her years as an outspoken first lady and delegate to the 
		United Nations, Eleanor Roosevelt was one of the most respected women in 
		the world. She was a symbol of the new role women were to play in the 
		world, and her major legacy, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
		remains an ideal to which the world still strives. The niece of 
		President Theodore Roosevelt, she married her distant cousin Franklin 
		Roosevelt in 1905. After Franklin fell ill with polio in 1921, she 
		became involved in Democratic politics, and her activities helped 
		stimulate and renew her husband's political interests. <br><br>In 1932, 
		New York Governor Franklin Roosevelt was elected to the White House, and 
		Eleanor began her 12 years as first lady. Not one to live by convention, 
		she was the nation's first openly political first lady, working 
		tirelessly as a defender of equal rights and opportunities for the 
		nation's poor and dispossessed. Beginning in 1936, she wrote a 
		nationally syndicated column called &quot;My Day,&quot; which addressed many of 
		the pressing political issues of the times. She often traveled alone on 
		behalf of her disabled husband and was a much sought-after speaker. <br>
		<br>After President Roosevelt died in 1945, his successor, President 
		Harry Truman, appointed her as a delegate to the newly formed United 
		Nations. From 1946 to 1951 she was chairman of the U.N. Commission on 
		Human Rights. On December 10, 1948, the U.N. General Assembly 
		unanimously adopted her commission's Universal Declaration of Human 
		Rights, which sought to establish basic criteria of civil rights for all 
		the people of the world. Roosevelt left the U.N. in 1952 (returning 
		temporarily in 1961) and continued to be active in politics. She died in 
		1962. </td>
