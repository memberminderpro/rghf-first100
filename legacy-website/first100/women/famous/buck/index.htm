		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">The organization of this 
		International Convention was somewhat different. Yes, RI had come back 
		to New York City after only ten years, but it took 39 years to get there 
		in the first place. More commonplace were the remarks of the outgoing RI 
		President, Clifford A. Randall, in the first plenary session in Madison 
		Square Garden. However, in an unparalleled move, both author Pearl S. 
		Buck and rocket scientist Dr. Wernher von Braun were scheduled to give 
		keynote addresses in the second plenary session, on Tuesday morning, 
		June 9, 1959.<br><br>The second plenary session convened at 9:45 o'clock 
		in Madison Square Garden in New York City, USA, President Randall 
		presiding. Community singing was led by Song Leader Walter Jenkins of 
		Houston, Texas. Some telegrams were read, General Secretary George Means 
		presented a summary of his Annual Report on Rotary, a masked panel of 
		journalists (Washington correspondents) answered questions from the 
		delegates, and then President Randall began his introduction of Pearl 
		Buck.<br><br>“It is now our great privilege to hear from a remarkable 
		woman who has made a definite place for herself in the history of our 
		time. Though born in West Virginia, her childhood was spent in the 
		historic city of Chinkiang, China, the country which provided the locale 
		for many of her popular novels.<br><br>The author of such best sellers 
		as &quot;The Good Earth&quot;, &quot;East Wind: West Wind&quot;, &quot;The Exile&quot;, &quot;Letter From 
		Peking&quot; and others, she was awarded the Pulitzer prize for &quot;The Good 
		Earth&quot; in 1931, and the Nobel prize for literature in 1938, the first 
		American woman to be so honored in the world of letters. Besides being a 
		prolific writer, her other activities include her fine work with 
		retarded children, and the establishment and maintenance of Welcome 
		House, Inc., an adoption agency which finds homes and parents for needy 
		children. It is a real pleasure and privilege for me to welcome our 
		distinguished guest and speaker this morning, Miss Pearl S. Buck.”<br>
		<br>Though women were not members of Rotary at the time, a few had 
		addressed plenary sessions of an International Convention, most doing 
		“work of the convention.” Pearl Buck was probably one of only three or 
		four women to give a keynote address by 1959. She addressed the 
		convention on &quot;The Face and Future of Youth Throughout the World.&quot;<br>
		<br>Buck reviewed some of the historic developments affecting young 
		people, particularly those of modern revolutions, and added, &quot;The young 
		cannot wait. They have seen the faces of the old and they will not wait. 
		They do not want to look like them when they are old. They want to live 
		in the new world that lies over the threshold of tomorrow. The young 
		need hope. They need stability of mind and soul. With hope and stability 
		they can do the work that waits to be done. Our task is to prove to them 
		that it is safe to hope, that it is wise to be sincerely good. From hope 
		and faith in practical goodness will come the security and energy to 
		build the new world which, in technical and practical terms, is waiting 
		only for the creative will of man to go to work.&quot;<br><br>She was 
		followed by Dr. Wernher von Braun, director of development operations of 
		the U.S. Army's ballistic missile agency and one of the outstanding 
		rocket experts of the Space Age. His topic was &quot;Countdown in Peace.&quot;<br>
		<br>In view of the events of September 11, 2001, Pearl Buck’s address 
		has a lot to say to the Rotarians of the 21st Century.<br><br><strong>
		The Face and Future of Youth Throughout the World<br></strong><br>By 
		Pearl S. Buck<br>Perkasie, Pennsylvania, 
		U. S. A.<br><br>IT IS a great pleasure for me to be here this morning 
		and to see so vast a crowd gathered together from so many countries in 
		the world. I think my first experience with Rotary was too many years 
		ago in the City of Bangkok. Of course, I knew about Rotary in the United 
		States, being an American, but I had never been to any function. And 
		that day, when I happened to be in Bangkok, the prince was giving a 
		luncheon for Rotary; he himself being a Rotarian. He was a very charming 
		person, and I enjoyed sitting next to him. Then he got up to open the 
		meeting. After a few preliminary remarks in English, which was of the 
		Oxford variety, he began to make a speech, such an American speech that 
		I could have thought I was in the corn belt, Ohio or Illinois or 
		somewhere like that. And when he sat down, I said, &quot;Have you been in our 
		Midwest?&quot;<br><br>He said, &quot;No, but that speech was sent to me from 
		Chicago.&quot;<br><br>It was a very good speech, incidentally. I might say 
		from there I went on to Java where I saw my first Walt Disney film, and 
		that was &quot;The Big Bad Wolf.&quot; Do you remember that? There, also, I first 
		made the acquaintance, by motion picture, of Mae West. So, I felt quite 
		ready to come back and live in my own country.<br><br>MY TOPIC that has 
		been assigned to me this morning is &quot;The Face of Youth in the World of 
		Today,&quot; and I think I could not have chosen a title more interesting to 
		myself than this. For I watch the youth of every nation, to the best of 
		my ability these days, with constant attention. They are, of course, the 
		most important group in the human race at this moment.<br><br>They have 
		always been important, and those of us who are partly Asian by birth or 
		long acquaintance and education, have always known somehow the very 
		special value of children, the young, who are to carry on the torch of 
		life after we are gone. They have been the ones we have had to teach, 
		the ones that are destined to take the place of the elders, and they are 
		the transmitters of the lessons of history and the traditions of 
		culture. We have trained them and adjured them; we have reproved and 
		approved them.<br><br>In the past, that man or woman was most approved 
		who understood most clearly and valued most highly the experiences of 
		those who went before him. But today's young people have quite a 
		different significance. Within the lifetime of each of us here in this 
		great hall, such tremendous changes have taken place that our youth no 
		longer can be or are transmitters. What can they transmit? What of the 
		past is worth saving? What can be restored even if it is worth saving? 
		What shall we teach our youth? What do we ourselves know? So rapid have 
		been the changes in every part of the world and in every phase of life 
		that what we teach today may be of little use tomorrow. The young know 
		our predicament. They stand peculiarly alone. The past seems to have 
		dropped away and the future is still clouded in mystery.<br><br>WHAT has 
		brought about this singular moment in which we live? When I survey the 
		changes even in my own insignificant lifetime, it seems to me that T can 
		survey the whole of human history compressed. I take myself as a mere 
		example. I began my conscious years in ancient China. I grew up in the 
		medieval ages, which then, for a time, seemed endless. I read my books 
		by candlelight or by the slow flame of a primitive oil lamp. Until I was 
		12 years old, I never saw a train in China, and I was a good deal older 
		before I ever entered one. Instead, when I traveled, I rode a Mongolian 
		pony or sat in a spring-less mule cart and jostled over stone paved 
		roads built centuries before I was born. We did not even have rickshaws 
		in the city near which I lived. Rickshaws were, only in modern cities 
		like Shanghai.<br><br>Peace was our atmosphere. I never heard of such 
		crimes as I see every day now on the front pages of newspapers. There 
		must have been crimes, human nature being what it is, but we did not 
		hear of them. I never saw a policeman until I was 15 years old, and then 
		they were Sikh policemen in the British Concession in Shanghai, and I 
		used to wonder why they stood there obstructing the traffic. Running 
		water, electricity, telephones–these were heard of but unknown to me.<br>
		<br>YET even in those years, seemingly so calm, there were tremendous 
		changes taking place, subterranean but heroic and portentous. Under the 
		quiet flow of time, an era was ending and a new one begun, whose full 
		meaning we are not yet able to comprehend. The empire of China, the 
		dynastic stream which seemed eternal, was coming to an end. The end was 
		not sudden. Nothing is really sudden, if we read history aright. The 
		decline of the Chinese empire took 200 years, and even the speed with 
		which it fell seemed rapid during the last hundred years, after the 
		Taiping Rebellion, during which 20 million Chinese were killed. That 
		rebellion, led by a disappointed youth, a young scholar, who was 
		inspired by the revolutionary doctrines of Christianity, could never 
		have been quelled had not western military men organized armies for the 
		Imperial Peking government.<br><br>It is interesting to pause here for 
		half a minute and to consider what would have happened if those western 
		governments had chosen not to side with the old imperial forces but with 
		the young rebel forces. China today would not have been Communist, in 
		all probability, and it might even have been that Russia would not have 
		been Communist. Undoubtedly, Lenin was encouraged and inspired by the 
		knowledge that an uncommitted and distraught Asia lay beyond the borders 
		of Russia as possible allies for the future.<br><br>At that time, 
		however, the astute old Empress Dowager already guessed such dangers. 
		When the czar of Russia offered to send help against those young Taiping 
		rebels who threatened her throne and, indeed, her very life, she sent 
		back a doughty answer. &quot;We prefer our Chinese rebels,&quot; she said. &quot;We 
		prefer our Chinese rebels to Russian armies, even though those armies 
		come to fight on our behalf.&quot;<br><br>THE West had another opportunity to 
		win the new China in 1911, when the young rebels of that generation, 
		inspired by Sun Yat-sen, brought about the final end, not only of a 
		dynasty but of the whole complex system of government which had been 
		slowly and painfully developed and built through thousands of years. The 
		end came too quickly. The young rebels themselves were not prepared for 
		so sudden a change. Their ideas of modern government hastily absorbed 
		from the republican system of the United States, were impractical for a 
		people whose history was totally different from that of the Americans. 
		In the distressful vacuum, and I experienced it with everyone else 
		living then in China, Sun Yat-sen and his followers appealed in his time 
		to one western power and another for help, financial and advisory. 
		Again, the West rejected the new group. And, again; Russia came forward 
		with promises and advice– a Communist Russia this time, one immeasurably 
		stronger than the old Czarist Russia, because she had already embarked 
		upon her own revolution successfully and was in the process of changing 
		her ancient agrarian culture into a modern industrial one.<br><br>Please 
		remember that in 1921 the Communists were formally recognized as a 
		political party in China. But before Sun Yat-sen could understand what 
		he had approved in desperation, it is true, he was dead of cancer of the 
		liver, dying in that great hospital in Peking built by a great American 
		capitalist. Seven years later, his favorite young military officer, 
		Chiang Kai-shek, separated himself from the new rebel phase of 
		revolution flourishing under Russian Communist leadership and, by a tour 
		de force, set up the Nationalist Government in Nanking in 1927. And as 
		his first step in the task of unification of his country, a task 
		unfinished because of the attack from Japan, he drove the Communists, as 
		you will remember, into the far northwest where, in retreat, they 
		planned their grand strategy, which strategy they were able to carry out 
		far more swiftly than they had hoped, because of the war which Japan 
		forced upon them, and which became the second world war.<br><br>IN the 
		chasm left at the end of that war, the young Communist revolutionary 
		party stepped into power and, as you know, today we face a rising and 
		mighty nation, a great structure built upon the foundation of centuries. 
		And yet China is only part of the future, which the young of every other 
		country must now face, possibly a fearful part, we do not know.<br><br>I 
		have spoken thus much of China because she is the example, above all 
		others today, of the force of desperate rebellious youth in our world, a 
		world where the past has been destroyed by the findings of science, just 
		as the little old empire of China was destroyed by the impact of modern 
		ideas. The revolution in China, certainly the revolution of the last 
		hundred years, has been fomented, developed and accomplished by youth, 
		led by the brilliant young intellectuals who learned long ago that, if 
		they were to be successful, they must summon to their support the bulk 
		of the nation, who are the peasants.<br><br>So, therefore, when we look 
		at the face of our youth today, let us remember the history of China of 
		the last hundred years. Desperate and frustrated youth, springing from 
		the sturdy peasant soil of Asia, may present a glorious opportunity for 
		a better world than we have ever known, if we can remove the- 
		frustration and ease that desperation, or it may fall a victim to 
		tyranny, capable of the most frightening behavior and the most monstrous 
		acts.<br><br>A CANADIAN friend of mine, whom I knew in China throughout 
		childhood, who speaks Chinese as his native tongue, has been in China 
		recently, and while there he observed those changes which seemed to us 
		tragic. He said that China seems to be administered by young people 
		between the ages of 17 and 25–a terrifying situation, I might say, when 
		contemplated by those of us no longer young.<br><br>But I can believe 
		it, and I can believe anything that youth does, in desperation, can be 
		true. Even when I was in China, I saw the young people struggling to 
		make a new world. They came back from abroad, from America and from 
		Europe, and what they found at home filled them with the strange, 
		maddening rage that is compounded of anger and love. They loved their 
		country; they loved their native land, their villages, and they hated 
		them because they were so backward, seemed so slow and medieval. They 
		were amiable and content and ignorant of the modern world. It is a mood 
		common enough in any country to youth coming home from college, hut in 
		China, I saw it on a stupendous scale, and these young people were so 
		few compared to the many of the mass and, therefore, they were the more 
		fierce and the more angry.<br><br>I once wrote a story about it, 
		entitled &quot;Shanghai Scene&quot;, a scene I actually saw at the railway station 
		there, where a young guard is trying to force some sort of order among a 
		crowd of humble people all struggling to get on the train at once. When 
		he is totally unsuccessful, in spite of shouts and orders, he bursts 
		into loud sobs and began to beat those people with a carrying pole he 
		snatched from a farmer.<br><br>I UNDERSTOOD him so well, but I 
		understood the bewildered folk, too. They were centuries apart. But that 
		young man could be the Communist leader of today, ruthless in 
		desperation, not knowing how to shape his world to his desire, except by 
		force, extermination, liquidation, death, if necessary, not always 
		because he wants to kill but because he must rid himself somehow and at 
		last, anyhow, of the old, unteachable and the reluctant, if his new 
		dream world is ever to come true.<br><br>This is the secret of 
		revolution, the bloody secret, which grows into such monstrous 
		flowering. The young cannot wait. They have seen the faces of the old, 
		and they will not wait. They do-not want to look like those people, when 
		they grow old. They want to live in that new world that lies over the 
		threshold of tomorrow.<br><br>I have spent this much time with you, as 
		best I can, in trying to describe in a very sketchy way the youth of 
		today.<br><br>Well, I do not envy the young their task, because today 
		our young people are all in untried territory. They have paper maps, 
		constitutions, bills of rights, or Karl Marx, but the roads are still 
		only plans and the jungles are not cleared. The task is more than 
		formidable; they fear it may be impossible. To build new governments, to 
		create order, they think can only be done by force when there is no 
		time.<br><br>Thus, they are caught in the wasteful processes of 
		revolution. For revolution is surely the most wasteful and explosive and 
		destructive force in human history. When we realize that such an 
		explosive force may at any time be combined with the-explosive force of 
		atomic energy in new weapons and will certainly be combined with the 
		rise in population, potentially explosive, the future could seem doomed 
		to nonexistence. <br><br>I SAY &quot;could&quot; and not &quot;must&quot;, because the 
		atomic explosion ~ill not be used unless it is set up by the human 
		explosion, and that explosion will not come from old people or tired 
		people or sick people, but from youth, and for youth there is still 
		measurable time.' It is true that youth is more explosive today than it 
		has ever been before, especially in the underprivileged) countries.<br>
		<br>Science has not only created the bomb but it has also created 
		life-prolonging instruments, for example, the simple insecticide DDT. 
		DDT, to use only one example, destroys, as you know, the anopheles 
		mosquito, among other insects. This mosquito brings malaria into the 
		blood stream of human beings. Malaria has been a great asset to empire 
		builders. Malaria makes people submissive and apathetic; and not very 
		hungry for food. People have no strength or will to rebel, when they are 
		full of malaria. But put an end to malaria by killing the mosquito, and 
		people begin to grow strong and hungry.<br><br>In the last few years, we 
		have achieved a sudden and radical health improvement in many areas of 
		the world, a work begun beforehand during the war and mainly for 
		military services, but which the UN sponsored programs are carrying on, 
		and other organizations, also. In the past, the Asian life span, for 
		example, shortened by malaria and other diseases to a mere 20 or 30 
		years, left little time for work or rebellion or education, but it is 
		now being lengthened to provide not only energy but time for education 
		and achievement and, if necessary; rebellion.<br><br>The result of all 
		this is a more vigorous and longer-lived population. Hemoglobin has been 
		a source of strength for revolutions. As someone has said, when 
		Churchill ordered DDT to be used for the British forces in Egypt in 
		1944, he unwittingly hastened the liquidation of the British Empire.<br>
		<br>TODAY'S youth is energized by modern science, awakening, hungry for 
		life and opportunity, a tremendous asset to any people, if these young 
		people pour their energies into constructive work, but dangerous if 
		their energies are not used. Communist governments understand this fact, 
		I am afraid, and while I do not doubt they value youth partly because 
		youth are malleable and easily led and inspired, yet I do not doubt, 
		either, that they realize very well that youth, unappeased-and idle, 
		threatens the continuing existence of any-government.<br><br>Where the 
		government is still in control by means of tradition, stability and a 
		trained police force, as in the United States and Britain, for example, 
		and other countries, the frustrations of the young break out in juvenile 
		delinquency, or are expressed in a studied indifference to the outside 
		world and in an unnatural quest for security, a security that cannot 
		exist in human life. Industries, at least in the United States, complain 
		that young men today are more interested in benefits and retirement 
		plans than they are in the job itself. This is the reverse of 
		revolution, you might say, but it is also destructive, because it is an 
		evidence of inner hopelessness and despair.<br><br>So, in this day of 
		crumbling idealism and weakening tradition, and changing family mores, 
		what shall we give our youth, if they are to be an asset and not a 
		menace?<br><br>FIRST of all, I think we all realize we must give them 
		hope. There has been too much talk of terror–terror of atomic attack, 
		terror of Communism, terror of alien peoples, terror everywhere. The 
		world atmosphere has been dark with depression and fear. I am not a 
		sentimental person and not, perhaps by nature or experience, an 
		optimist, but I am not a pessimist either. These extremes are 
		irrational. After considerable and continuing acquaintance with 
		scientists and their work, taken in conjunction with some knowledge of 
		various peoples, I am persuaded to a cautious, calculated optimism.<br>
		<br>I am convinced that peoples everywhere–this includes scientists and 
		everyone–not only don't want war but they are terrified, above all else, 
		of modern war. I am sure that even governments are anxious to prevent 
		war, in spite of their tricks and manners. I agree with many others that 
		it is extremely unlikely that we shall have another large-scale war, 
		barring accident or folly. At least this peace, uneasy though it is, 
		gives us precious time to make hope into a reality. It is quite possible 
		we shall have time to create a world where peace can be watchfully taken 
		for granted.<br><br>IT IS this hope, which we must somehow give to our 
		young–a reasonable, calm, calculated hope. Last week, when I spoke to a 
		great crowd of high school students not far from here, 1800 of them, 
		many of them came up, not to thank me so much as to say, with a sort of 
		touching wonder, &quot;You have given us some hope. We do so want to have 
		some hope.&quot; Well, there is hope; there is hope for new adventure. Youth 
		has to adventure, must adventure.<br><br>It may be quite true that space 
		travel will, as some have said, provide this adventure as an alternative 
		to war. The roots of war we do not understand. They lie deeply hidden in 
		men's blood and brains. None of us understands why it is that men seem 
		unable, century after century, to free themselves from the enchantment 
		of battle. Military heroics are essentially false because they are 
		regressive and harmful, yet they continue especially to charm those men 
		who are perennial boys.<br><br>May not space flight offer a field for 
		this pioneering and adventure? If so, let us encourage it for the sake 
		of a peace that, so far, no age in the history of mankind has been able 
		to achieve. There are also the side benefits of space travel. Space 
		satellites, we are told, will serve as weather stations and global 
		communication relay stations. Human lives will be saved from hurricanes 
		and droughts and floods. Weather satellites alone will save us here in 
		the United States, our chief of the Weather Bureau says in Washington, 
		about $4 billion a year. Information concerning tornadoes will be very 
		valuable, for these storms originate in the cumulus clouds high in the 
		atmosphere and always rotate counterclockwise to earth–we do not know 
		why.<br><br>WE HAVE other reasons for hope, peace, adventure but also 
		economic security. Atomic energy has been discovered at a time when the 
		world most needs it, perhaps, or the time is coming soon. As our 
		resources of coal and oil dwindle and become increasingly difficult and 
		expensive to procure, we have this wonderful atomic energy, not to 
		mention solar energy, hydrogen fusion, an inexhaustible new power. The 
		very oceans are being combed for resources hitherto inaccessible to man.<br>
		<br>In one year, for another example, the immense electrically powered 
		pumps of the Ethvl-Dow bromine plant near Wilmington, Delaware, lifted a 
		square mile of ocean, eighty-nine feet deep, into the towers of that 
		plant. The bromine was extracted and the water, with the rest of the 
		elements, was returned to the sea. But, we are told by chemists, if all 
		the elements could have been removed by atomic energy, or some other 
		energy, it would have provided a mineral wealth of 100 million dollars. 
		We cannot mine the sea yet, still too expensive, but some day it will be 
		mined by new and cheaper power. Then gold, and silver and platinum will 
		be so plentiful that we can use it for pipes, non-rusting pipes, and, 
		best of all, the deserts of the earth will be flooded with fresh, 
		life-giving water.<br><br>YFS, we can hope even for plenty of food for 
		an expanding population.<br><br>In plant life, radiation and radioactive 
		isotopes speed up evolution and produce changes that would take the 
		labor of many men for at least a century to produce by breeding alone. 
		In a single generation, we can project plants 1,000 years into the 
		future. Oats, for example–I happen to be a farmer–treated by radioactive 
		isotopes, mature earlier, give a higher yield and are rust resistant, 
		have shorter and stronger stalks than ordinary oats. Barley, wheat and 
		corn so<br>treated will produce higher yields and are disease-free. 
		Peanuts yield a 30 per cent higher crop and are disease-resistant.<br>
		<br>On the very day when I last visited Oak Ridge and saw the wonderful 
		plant improvement they are doing there, I found that my friend from 
		India, the famous scientist, Dr. Boshi Sen, had sent wheat and corn from 
		Almora, India, to be treated with radioactivity. He told the scientists 
		at Oak Ridge that his yields were much improved thereby. Atomic energy 
		can be used to improve the yield of fruit trees, and help to find out 
		how and when to fertilize land. It can preserve foods so that countries 
		without refrigeration can have balanced diets of meats and vegetables 
		and fruits. Perhaps the most important result of all is yet to come.<br>
		<br>Biophysicists are now studying how to reproduce photosynthesis, or 
		the process whereby growing plants use sunlight to produce essential 
		body-building units.<br><br>WE HAVE reason to hope, too, for deliverance 
		sometime in the not too distant future from certain deadly diseases.<br>
		<br>One of the principal sources of radioisotopes in the world today is 
		the great reactor at Oak Ridge. It stands, a huge block of graphite 
		encased in cement, with more than 1,200 openings in the face. Into these 
		openings are thrust the medical materials to be irradiated. More than 
		1,000 shipments go out every month to various hospitals, industrial 
		plants and laboratories all over the world, just from this one reactor, 
		and there are others.<br><br>With all this hope, reasonable, calculated 
		and cautious hope for material improvement and abundance, we need the 
		hope of new faith, faith in ourselves and in our fellow human beings. 
		Much of our trouble today, a source of insecurity, is the loss of faith 
		in the integrity of human beings. We do not trust one another; we 
		cannot, for we have no common agreement upon what constitutes basic 
		grounds for trust, for mutual trust.<br><br>It is natural that people 
		are afraid, not only the young, as we gaze into the limitless horizons 
		before us. But let us remind ourselves and our youth, that, while the 
		human race has always met new horizons with preliminary fear, the 
		eternal verities of human goodness remain the same, in whatever country, 
		among whatever people. A good man, a good woman, is the same person, 
		wherever he or she is born and whatever language he or she speaks. 
		Honesty, integrity, the habit of industry, the cultivation of wisdom and 
		human understanding, the habit of compassion–these remain unchanged 
		throughout the ages, whatever the world and however the world changes.<br>
		<br>THE stability youth seeks so desperately today and needs so much 
		will not be found only in the material solidifies, which always change, 
		but in the qualities of good character and trustworthiness in human 
		beings. Indeed, there can be no real progress or peace, whatever our 
		material improvement, until, also, we develop these qualities in common.<br>
		<br>It is true that in times of disturbance and distress people do 
		forsake wisdom and follow false leaders, thereby destroying civilization 
		itself. We saw this in Nazi Germany, for example, and humanity has not 
		yet recovered. It is as essential therefore, practically speaking, for 
		nations to agree upon how we ought to act toward one another, upon what 
		principles should be held in common, as it is to agree upon the uses of 
		nuclear power; otherwise one nation may teach its young the ways of 
		peace and mutual respect and cooperation; another nation may at the same 
		time be instilling the doctrines of hate and hostility.<br><br>I hear, 
		again for example, that the policy today in Communist China is to take 
		children, very young, away from the families and put them into the 
		commune system. Twenty-five million is the figure I have been given. 
		These children, I am told, are being taught systematically to hate 
		Americans, or the United States. At intervals during the day they shout 
		in unison, for as long as 15 minutes at a time, &quot;Kill Americans. Sak ma 
		kowlen.&quot; If this is true, what shall we of the United States teach our 
		children? We cannot and will not teach them hate, for this would destroy 
		our own civilization and the ideals which we ourselves are struggling to 
		achieve. Yet to do nothing, not even to recognize the potential danger 
		of hatred against us, is as dangerous as it would be to ignore the 
		possibility of atomic bombs being dropped upon us.<br><br>IN COMMON 
		prudence, we ought all to remove barriers between peoples so that we can 
		learn that we are not hateful, that no nation is hateful. And the young 
		must so be taught. I should like to see the educators of youth, 
		everywhere in the world, meet together to decide upon the essentials of 
		character and character-building, in order that we can develop a basic 
		human nature, approved by all and practiced by all.<br><br>I submit that 
		this is the stability we need and must have as inevitably we come closer 
		together in this new world. Real security is in the validity of 
		character. To be able to trust one's neighbor is security better than 
		money in the bank. Such trust is essential to world-peace. It must, of 
		course, have its guarantees, just as a town must have its police. But 
		the town agrees first upon what the security must be.<br><br>When we 
		agree upon the essentials of good character, and when we can teach those 
		essentials to all our youth, at the same time, not an impossible dream, 
		we have a plan whereby we can proceed to Q better world and a stable 
		world. Man has new power, but the center of power shifts so rapidly 
		that, without the stability of moral character, we live in continual 
		instability. The time constant in scientific development is about a 
		decade or, at most, two. Each new technical development follows rapidly 
		on the one before.<br><br>WE MUST find stability within ourselves, based 
		upon these common codes of character and similar standards of behavior. 
		We must find it, or we will find that our youth is consumed by fear of 
		potential enemies. We must somehow put into practice the simplicities of 
		goodness. You may ask how we can get two such presently opposed nations 
		as the United States and Soviet Russia to agree on anything. I think we 
		can agree upon the welfare of the peoples. Then, this principle agreed 
		upon, each nation can proceed to its own method of putting this 
		principle into practice. The responsibility must rest upon each nation 
		to provide for the growth of the human beings within its own boundaries. 
		It is not our business here in the United States, or any other country, 
		to tell others how this is to be done.<br><br>The social rivalry will be 
		met by how well the method works and the fittest will survive. Most of 
		the world needs food and good health and education and jobs. There is 
		much hard, interesting work to be done to make this world, and our youth 
		can do it, if they are given hope instead of desperation, the stability 
		of integrity and goodness instead of deceit and intrigue and, with all 
		this, the inspiration of work itself.<br><br>THIS will, of course, take 
		leadership and organization. But, in closing, I would like to remind you 
		that there is ample leadership in the world, in the wise men and women 
		of every nation. We are wasting our wise people now. They live far from 
		each other; they speak in single voices, and they are unheard in the 
		clamor. Yet they are a resource and our primary source. I recommend that 
		we seek them out and get them together and demand their wisdom. Let us 
		use them not only to teach our young but to teach us, all of us, so that 
		we can do more easily what must be done and can be done, if we will only 
		bestir ourselves to do it. Criminals gather together to do their evil. 
		Why should not the good gather their forces together to do their good?<br>
		<br>The young need hope. They need stability of mind and soul. With hope 
		and stability, they can do the work that is to be done, that waits to be 
		done. Our task is to prove to them that it is safe to hope and that it 
		is wise to be sincerely good. From hope and new faith I believe there 
		will come the security and energy to build the world that we wait for, 
		in technical and practical terms–that new and better world which is 
		really waiting only for the creative will of mankind to go to work.</td>
