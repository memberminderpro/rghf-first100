		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">Southern Presbyterian missionaries 
		Absalom and Caroline Sydenstricker gave birth to Pearl Comfort 
		Sydenstricker on born on June 26, 1892, in Hillsboro, West Virginia, 
		USA. Their mission was in China. The fourth of seven children, Pearl was 
		born near the end of a vacation for her parents in the United States. 
		One of only three children that would survive to adulthood, she was 
		taken to China by her parents at the age of three months, where she 
		lived for most of the first forty years of her life.<br><br>The 
		Sydenstrickers mission was headquartered in Chinkiang, a small city 
		lying at the junction of the Yangtze River and the Grand Canal, though 
		Absolem spent the majority of every year preaching and prosletizing in 
		rural China, seeking converts; Pearl's mother, Caroline, provided 
		nursing and medical help to Chinese women in a little clinic and 
		apothecary that the family had established.<br><br>Pearl grew up fluent 
		in both English and Chinese, she was instructed by both her mother and a 
		Chinese tutor. During the Boxer Uprising in 1900, Caroline Sydenstricker 
		and the surviving children had to evacuate to Shanghai, and they spent 
		several months waiting for word of Absalom Sydenstricker's fate. When he 
		finally returned to Shanghai later that year, they then returned to the 
		US for a furlough.<br><br>Pearl Sydenstricker enrolled in Randolph-Macon 
		Woman's College, in Lynchburg, Virginia in 1910, and she graduated in 
		1914. She returned to China shortly after graduation when she received 
		word that her mother was gravely ill. In 1915, she met John Lossing 
		Buck, a young Cornell graduate, who was an agricultural economist. They 
		married in 1917, and moved to Nanhsuchou in rural Anhwei province. It 
		was in this destitute community that Pearl Buck amassed the material 
		that would later be used in writing The Good Earth.<br><br>Pearl and 
		Lossing’s first child, Carol, was born in 1921, but was found to be 
		mentally retarded. Because of a uterine tumor discovered during the 
		delivery, Pearl underwent an emergency hysterectomy. However, she and 
		Lossing adopted a baby girl, Janice in 1925. The Buck marriage lasted 
		for eighteen years, but appeared unhappy almost from the beginning.<br>
		<br>From 1920 to 1933, Pearl and Lossing lived in Nanking on the campus 
		of Nanking University, where both had teaching positions. In 1921, 
		Pearl's mother died and shortly afterwards her father moved in with the 
		Bucks. The tragedies and dislocations which Pearl suffered in the 1920s 
		reached a climax in March, 1927, in the violence known as the &quot;Nanking 
		Incident.&quot; In a confused battle involving elements of Chiang Kai-shek's 
		Nationalist troops, Communist forces, and assorted warlords, several 
		Westerners were murdered. The Bucks spent a terrified day in hiding, 
		after which they were rescued by American gunboats. After a trip 
		downriver to Shanghai, the Buck family sailed to Unzen, Japan, where 
		they spent the following year. They then moved back to Nanking, though 
		conditions remained dangerously unsettled.<br><br>It was during the 
		1920s, that Pearl began to publish stories and essays in magazines such 
		as Nation, The Chinese Recorder, Asia, and Atlantic Monthly. Her first 
		novel, East Wind, West Wind, was published in 1930, by the John Day 
		Company. Day's publisher, Richard Walsh, eventually became Pearl's 
		second husband, in 1935, after they both received divorces.<br><br>John 
		Day published Pearl's second novel, The Good Earth in 1931. Not only the 
		best-selling book of both 1931 and 1932, it won Pearl the Pulitzer Prize 
		and the Howells Medal in 1935, and would be adapted as a major MGM film 
		in 1937. Other novels and books of non-fiction quickly followed. In 
		1938, less than a decade after her first book had appeared, Pearl won 
		the Nobel Prize in literature, the first American woman to do so. By the 
		time of her death in 1973, Pearl would publish over seventy books: 
		novels, collections of stories, biography and autobiography, poetry, 
		drama, children's literature, and translations from the Chinese.<br><br>
		In 1934, because of conditions in China, and also to be closer to 
		Richard Walsh and her daughter Carol, whom she had placed in an 
		institution in New Jersey, Pearl moved permanently to the US. She bought 
		an old farmhouse, Green Hills Farm, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, today 
		a National Historic Landmark. She and Richard adopted six more children 
		over the following years.<br><br>Immediately upon reaching the US, Pearl 
		became active in American civil rights and women's rights activities. 
		She published essays in both Crisis, the journal of the NAACP, and 
		Opportunity, the magazine of the Urban League; she was a trustee of 
		Howard University for twenty years, beginning in the early 1940s. In 
		1942, Pearl and Richard founded the East and West Association, dedicated 
		to cultural exchange and understanding between Asia and the West. In 
		1949, outraged that existing adoption services considered Asian and 
		mixed-race children unadoptable, Pearl established Welcome House, the 
		first international, inter-racial adoption agency; in the nearly five 
		decades of its work, Welcome House has assisted in the placement of over 
		six thousand children.<br><br>In June of 1959, Pearl Buck gave the first 
		of two keynote addresses during the second plenary session of Rotary’s 
		International Convention in New York City. (The second was given by Dr. 
		Werner von Braun.) In 1964, to provide support for Amerasian children 
		who were not eligible for adoption, Pearl also established the Pearl S. 
		Buck Foundation, which provides sponsorship funding for thousands of 
		children in half-a-dozen Asian countries. In 1991, the Pearl S. Buck 
		Foundation and Welcome House combined to form the organization known 
		today as Pearl S. Buck International.<br><br>Buck passed away just 
		months before her 81st birthday, in March 1973. Dr. Peter Conn reported 
		that she is buried at Green Hills Farm.<br><br>Sources include the July 
		1959 issue of The Rotarian, the 1959 Convention Proceedings and Pearl S. 
		Buck: A Cultural Biography by Dr. Peter Conn (Cambridge, 1996).</td>
