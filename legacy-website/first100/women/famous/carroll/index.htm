		plunged into World War II. One of the first women to ever address a

		<strong>The World Unites For Children</strong><br>By Miss Madeleine 
		Carroll<br>Distinguished Actress of the Stage and Screen<br>
		<br>Ladies and Gentlemen: First I'd like to say how deeply I appreciate 
		the honor you have done me in asking me to speak this morning at your 
		first plenary session. I am told that I am to be the only woman speaker 
		of the week, which makes my responsibility a very heavy one.<br><br>
		Whatever happens I must uphold the honor of my sex–and if I should fail 
		in my responsibility towards the children in whose behalf I am speaking 
		today, I would indeed be an unhappy woman. However, I am somehow not too 
		afraid, for even though this is such an enormous place, and you are so 
		many, there is coming from you to me such a good warm feeling of 
		kindliness, that even though I did not know I was among Rotarians, I 
		think I could guess it. And it is because you stand for kindliness and 
		good neighborliness that I want to speak to you; just as one speaks to 
		good neighbors and friends, and not as an alleged actress talking to the 
		public.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="hope.jpg" style="float: left">Just for the next few minutes I want you to forget you 
		ever saw me in any movie and that I ever was Bob Hope's favorite blonde–<br>
		<br>although there's nothing wrong with that I may say–but, now will you 
		allow me to be very simply the woman who, with millions of others, was 
		involved in the rather disconcerting business of war that went on in 
		Europe between the years 1939 and 1945, and who stayed on to work with 
		the unhappy child victims of the war.<br><br>Believe it or not, I'd 
		sooner not talk about myself, but I feel to make things clearer I should 
		tell you a little of some of the discoveries I made during that troubled 
		time, so that you will understand why I am here today, and why I have 
		constituted myself a &quot;one woman Children's Crusade.&quot;<br><br>As some of 
		you may know, I spent most of the war years in U. S. hospitals in Italy 
		and France as a Red Cross hospital worker and saw during that time the 
		most tragic aspect of war. For years, my daily associates were men with 
		broken bodies and broken minds, faces burned black in a plane that came 
		down in flames, trunks without legs or arms or either. But it was not 
		until the end of the war that I saw a sight which will be forever 
		engraved on my memory, and which proved to be a turning point in my 
		life.<br><br>I was in Paris, on leave for a few days from my hospital 
		train, and I was invited by some French students to go with them and 
		help entertain soldiers in a hospital for what the French call the 
		Gueules Cassées–the broken faces, or more factually those who for the 
		most part have little or no faces left. Nursing is not my profession, 
		but I had seen enough during the preceding years to know how to brace 
		myself in such circumstances, and all went very well as I greeted one by 
		one the tragic patients whom we had come to entertain. Until I came to 
		the end of the line and met the children with no faces. And there, only 
		the most superhuman effort on my part kept me from crying out in horror 
		and shame, that this should have been done to children. These children 
		were the victims of civilian bombardments. They are everywhere in 
		Europe, and in Asia–wherever war has passed. I have told you of them, 
		because the eyes of a child burning out of a shapeless mass that once 
		was a child's face will perhaps make you better understand the problem 
		we are discussing today–more than would all the statistics on 
		malnutrition and the incidence of tuberculosis, etc.<br><br>But how can 
		I make you feel the shame I felt as an adult before the accusing eyes of 
		these faceless children –that we in the wisdom of our superior years had 
		not had either the energy or the enlightenment to avoid the tragedy of 
		war for them. How can any one of us adults feel that we do not owe these 
		children and all like them who have suffered from war, a terrible debt?<br>
		<br>This I know was in 1945–four years ago. But how are things today? 
		Allow me to read to you the words of a New York Times woman 
		correspondent lately returned from Europe:<br><br>&quot;This is a picture of 
		the children of Europe four years after a war that showed them no mercy 
		and brought them no peace. For the past three months I have toured 
		countries on both sides of the Iron Curtain, and I have seen children 
		suffering, as children were never meant to suffer. On city streets, in 
		war orphanages, in crowded homes for mutilated children, in backward 
		mountain villages, in caves and pillboxes 'converted' to living 
		quarters, in tuberculosis sanitaria and congested general hospitals, 
		this is apparent: The aftermath of Hitler's genocidal war against the 
		youngest generation is still huge and terrifying.<br><br>&quot;Three years 
		after the war, millions of children are still on hunger rations. Many 
		hardly remember what a hot; nourishing meal tastes like, save as a brief 
		luxury of UNRRA-liberation days. Many have never known what milk looks 
		like. Their thin, undersized bodies and pale, patient faces reflect the 
		cruel logic of the occupation and war years.<br><br>&quot;For these are the 
		youngsters who suffered first from systematic malnutrition for at least 
		six years before peace came; then, after the war, took the same potluck 
		as their families, living where and how they could. Thus, thousands of 
		children, ragged and barefoot, still live in wartime bunkers, bombed-out 
		houses and dank cellars below the bombed buildings. Hundreds of 
		thousands are orphans who live in makeshift institutions, little old 
		wise people following a weary routine. Uncounted thousands wait in 
		special centers for artificial limbs, which have never come to replace 
		arms, hands and legs.<br><br>&quot;Others are perhaps worse off–the homeless 
		and abandoned who traveled a dozen kilometers a day to wherever they 
		hear of food and a bed. Nor is the limping army without its own social 
		outcasts–the professional beggars and<br>child prostitutes who, having 
		lived by their wits during the war for self-survival, still ply their 
		old trades on the streets and black markets. And over them all, 
		threatening further their precarious existence, hangs the 'white 
		plague', which thrives on malnutrition and neglect–tuberculosis.<br><br>
		&quot;This is the physical picture of the children. Psychologically, the 
		wounds go deeper for, as Dickens has observed 'In the little world in 
		which children have their existence, there is nothing so finely 
		perceived and so finely felt as injustice.<br><br>&quot;If the General 
		Assembly of the United Nations, which is to consider the problem next 
		month, does not realize what is happening to the children, the children 
		themselves do. They don't say it with words, of course. Unlike 
		youngsters accustomed to love and care, they have forgotten, or perhaps 
		they never knew, the age-old privilege of children–to ask. But their 
		thin and broken bodies and the rags they wear speak eloquently for them.<br>
		<br>&quot;The obvious needs are food, milk, cod-liver oil, clothes, shoes–the 
		basic necessities–but who will supply them adequately?&quot;<br><br>Let us 
		reawaken and reexamine our consciences sincerely and honestly. And I 
		don't mean automatically and wearily put our hands into our pockets, yet 
		again, for the dollar, which temporarily appeases the conscience. I am 
		not here today to appeal for money–but more seriously to ask you–every 
		one of you –what are we going to do about it?<br><br>Firstly, I'll tell 
		you what I did–since I did what any one of you would have done when 
		faced with the distress and the problems of so many unhappy children. I 
		decided after the war to stay on in Europe and do the little that one 
		individual could do–to alleviate the immediate misery around me. It was 
		a pretty hopeless business from the first and soon it was only too 
		obvious that I had to find another way to help.<br><br>I came back home 
		to America and was fortunate to be asked to work with the United Nations 
		International Children's Emergency Fund better known as UNICEF. You know 
		their story and how they have helped to rescue so many of the world's 
		children in the race against death. The initial report was by UNRRA, 
		which ended its activities in June 1947. When it ceased operations, 11 
		million dollars of its assets were transferred to the UNICEF.<br><br>
		Because of limited resources, the present program is reduced mainly to 
		providing special protective foodstuffs to meet the serious cases of 
		malnutrition in the war-ravaged countries. A single supplementary ration 
		is being distributed daily to four million children in 12 countries of 
		Europe and to 700,000 in China. It consists of 240 calories of fats and 
		60 calories of meat. This, of course, is not a sustaining diet. But it 
		is saving millions of lives. Limited medical aid has been made available 
		through the fund. With the cooperation of the World Health Organization, 
		mass vaccination programs are assisting governments to check the spread 
		of tuberculosis among the child population.<br><br>But as was the case 
		of UNRRA, so it is with UNICEF–it is only a drop of water in the bucket. 
		It has done a fine job with what limited funds it had at its disposal, 
		but at best it could only look after a small fraction of the world's 
		unhappy children and now there is reason to believe that even this help 
		must shortly be discontinued.<br><br>The problem, fellow human beings, 
		is plumped right back into our laps. But if you will stop to consider, 
		just for a few minutes, some of its aspects, and the terribly important 
		political and social implication inherent in it, I think you will 
		realize that it is very much our problem, and that we better start right 
		in thinking about it, as such.<br><br>I want you first of all to think 
		of your own children. That shouldn't be too difficult! It always 
		delighted me, in the hospital trains, to have the same experiences every 
		time I'd meet another new G.I. Immediately after the first brash 
		introductory remarks of a rather wolfish nature, the proud parent would 
		emerge from the &quot;wolf's clothing&quot; and present me with the rather 
		battered snapshot of &quot;junior.&quot;<br><br>You do a great deal for your 
		children. In every way that you know, you try to insure that their 
		bodies shall be healthy and strong, that their education be the best you 
		can give them, but how much do you think of the world in which they are 
		going to live and work? How often do you Rotarians think of the Fourth 
		Object of Rotary: &quot;The advancement of international understanding, good 
		will and peace through a world fellowship of business and professional 
		men united in the ideal of service?&quot;<br><br>This world fellowship, for 
		your children, is composed potentially of all the children growing up in 
		all the countries of the world–children growing up happily and healthily 
		as are your own, or else growing up as many of the German children grew 
		up after the last war with a sense of bitterness, frustration and 
		injustice which was such good ground for the growth of fascism and 
		communism.<br><br>Our first job is surely to look after the physical and 
		material needs of the child victims of the war, irrespective of race, 
		color or creed and in so doing, prove to them the reality and greatness 
		of our democratic principles.<br><br>We must win these children to our 
		side. They must be our children's friends. They must at least have a 
		chance to see the way Democracy works, because I can assure you from 
		bitter personal experience that the voice of the totalitarians is not 
		silent. Those children, if we let them grow up with a sense of 
		injustice, will be your children's enemies and they will form yet 
		another military machine to menace peace in your children's lifetime.<br>
		<br>It is vital that we help them therefore–we the people–and that we 
		take the leadership in a new and dynamic crusade. Where governments have 
		failed, we, being more personally involved, can win.<br><br>The press, 
		time and time again, has urged the public to take action. A recent 
		editorial in the New York Times says:<br><br>&quot;Americans, with just a 
		little imagination, can surely see the challenge. But that is hardly 
		enough. What is needed is the impatience born of decision–articulate 
		demand that this challenge be met with real action. It is true that the 
		U.N.'s International Children's Emergency Fund is giving a measure of 
		help to some 4,500,000 children in Europe and in China, chiefly with 
		dried skim milk and some canned meat and fish. But seven times that 
		number in Europe alone are in immediate critical need of supplemental 
		feeding, and the question is, must they suffer and sicken because 
		governments have fallen down on their contributions to the Children's 
		Fund? It is not enough to point out that the American government has 
		given more than other governments, as indeed it has. For the 
		contribution is still woefully small compared with the need. Nor is it 
		enough to sit idly by and condemn leading South American countries for 
		ignoring their obligations and contributing not a penny while supporting 
		the Children's Fund in principle, as, indeed, they must be condemned. 
		Rather, it is for Americans who do care about children to show their 
		concern by getting actively into this fight against disease and 
		malnutrition, which finally are a threat to their own children.<br><br>
		&quot;On December 11, 1946, the General Assembly of the United Nations, in 
		creating the Children's Fund, expressed 'the earnest hope that 
		governments, voluntary agencies and private individuals will give the 
		Fund their generous support.'<br><br>&quot;Because of the failure of the 
		national campaign to support the United Nations Appeal for Children, 
		which was an appeal to individuals, private Americans have not had a 
		true opportunity to express themselves. But surely it is not too late 
		for the American people to demand that they be allowed to serve the 
		cause with honor.&quot;<br><br>If, as it seems, UNICEF is to fold up, 
		something must take its place and immediately–unless, of course, you and 
		I can sleep happily in our beds at night when millions of children are 
		allowed to suffer and die.<br><br>The conscience of the world is not 
		sleeping, fortunately! In England there has been organized the World 
		Community Chest for Children, which works through existing organizations 
		in all countries, forming a committee with representatives of these 
		organizations and interested individuals within each country. It works 
		in close contact with UNICEF, UNESCO, the Red Cross and other 
		international associations. This committee is composed of volunteers, 
		they have a head office in London with six paid secretaries and that is 
		the extent of their overhead. You see, it does not need a large 
		bureaucracy and heavy overhead to make a thing like this work. It needs 
		enthusiasm and a burning belief in a cause, all of which I know exists 
		here, if only we have the energy to harness it and put it to work.<br>
		<br>I know, from my own very small experience, that since I proposed a 
		resolution to the U. S. Committee of the UNICEF that there be 
		constituted an International Children's Day, there has come to me from 
		people in many countries, the most heartening encouragement! People all 
		over the world, like you and me, want to do something for the children 
		and it seems to me that if we could reach out to each other, and join 
		hands, we would constitute such a force that the problem before us today 
		would very soon cease being a problem.<br><br>I am only one woman, and 
		will be remembered probably only because I loved children and tried to 
		find a way to help them. I would not presume to tell as important and 
		powerful an organization as you are what you should do.<br><br>I can 
		only make a few humble suggestions. You are powerful and you are many, 
		you can really help the children of the world.<br><br>I know that your 
		organization has a very special interest in youth.<br><br>I know, for 
		instance that just before the outbreak of war, you were considering 
		chartering a ship, which would affect regular exchanges of young people 
		between Europe and The States.<br><br>Even then, certain among you had 
		realized that, with our boundaries and frontiers shrinking every day, if 
		we are to survive this era we must learn to think of ourselves as part 
		of a world family.<br><br>Rotarians, use all the good influence you have 
		in your community to persuade the educational authorities, the 
		Parent-Teacher Associations and all such organizations to redouble their 
		efforts in the teaching of better international understanding and good 
		will. There is, I have discovered quite recently, a tendency in the high 
		schools, for instance, to cut down on the teaching of foreign languages. 
		An official of the New York Board of Regents recently announced: &quot;We 
		should give more job training and less importance to liberal arts in the 
		secondary schools.&quot;<br><br>My younger sister learned how to be a very 
		excellent typist but was killed at her typewriter by a direct hit from a 
		German bomb in London's 1941 Blitz. It seems to me that had the 
		generation previous to hers been more interested in encouraging good 
		neighborliness between countries, there is a chance my sister might be 
		alive today.<br><br>I am emphasizing all this because I have a very 
		strong feeling about this new generation of children growing up today. I 
		see in them not at all the generation of bobby-soxers, which preceded 
		them. On the contrary, I am amazed at their seriousness and their 
		readiness to learn more and more about the world they are to live in. It 
		is our duty to do all in our power to see that this knowledge is made 
		available to them so that they may still further be conditioned to the 
		responsibilities that lie ahead.<br><br>Let us give them yet more 
		responsibility and a greater participation, especially in any plans for 
		a new Children's Crusade. I believe that they can succeed where we 
		adults have so miserably failed.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="w29.gif" style="float: left">As Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
		(far left) said, when speaking to the International Student Assembly in 
		1942: &quot;Before the first World War, very few people in any country 
		believed that youth had the right to speak for itself, as a group or to 
		participate in councils of state.<br><br>&quot;We have learned much since 
		then. We know that wisdom does not come necessarily with years; that old 
		men may be foolish, and young men may be wise. But in every war it is 
		the younger generation which bears the burden of combat and inherits all 
		the ills that war leaves in its wake.&quot;<br><br>It was because I believe 
		so strongly in the youth of today that I would like to suggest and even 
		urge the inauguration of an International Children's Day as a sort of 
		spearhead to a new and challenging campaign: one which should have 
		color, drama and new meaning.<br><br>On such a day, children all over 
		the world would unite in a common aim: to help the less fortunate ones 
		among themselves. You, ladies and gentlemen of Rotary, can bring this 
		small idea of mine back to your communities and nurse it into growth, 
		you can start an international understanding of children by encouraging 
		your own children to understand and help children of their own age in 
		their own towns, less fortunate, of different classes, of different 
		racial strain or religious beliefs. And I believe the example of their 
		sincerity and earnestness would prove salutary to those of us whose 
		consciences have become dulled.<br><br>Someone must help the children. 
		Are we going to leave this job to the Fascists so that they may organize 
		yet another black, green or brown shirted horde; or to the Communists; 
		or shall we, before it is too late, grasp at those extended hands all 
		over the world, and give them the opportunity of seeing how &quot;Democracy 
		goes to work to save the children?&quot;</td>
