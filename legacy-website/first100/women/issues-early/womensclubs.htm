		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">&nbsp;These clubs aimed to cultivate middle class women in 
		new ideas acquired through study and culture. Such clubs are more 
		readily associated with the fraternalism clubs of the time than to the 
		later service clubs. Organizations such as the Masons, Elks and Moose 
		remained male only, but the members often invited their wives, “the 
		little woman,” to join them at sociable events.<br><br>Interestingly, 
		these clubs seemed to reinforce the stereotypical images of men and 
		women, yet the women’s club movement prospered. Often, the idea was to 
		simply replicate organizations such as the freemasonry movement, with 
		its secret rituals. Yet, by the 1880's there were over 900 such groups 
		around the USA.<br><br>However, many of these women's clubs actually 
		formed themselves into a General Federation of Women's Clubs and held 
		conventions. In 1889, President Charlotte E Brown's vision was for a 
		club that &quot;fits women for useful service in all the broadening 
		avocations that are opening before them.&quot; There were calls for women to 
		address the problems of the age and work for the improvement of the 
		social, civic and educational institutions.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/issues-early/images/womens-club-parade.jpg" style="float: left">These 
		women had a broad aim of self-culture and placed great emphasis on 
		setting up local libraries, petitioning on industrial reform and 
		campaigning for city beautification projects.<br><br>The women were very 
		successful in their social aims. Companionship aimed at self-improvement 
		flourished. The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), 
		under the leadership of Carrie Chapman Catt, who was president from 1900 
		to 1904, began successful efforts to recruit large members of socially 
		prominent and politically influential women (the &quot;society plan&quot;) and to 
		convince the growing numbers of middle and upper-class women involved in 
		women's clubs that woman suffrage would be a boon to their civic 
		improvement efforts.<br><br>They also reached out to the new generation of 
		college-educated women, many of them professionals, reminding them that 
		their opportunities were owed to the pioneers of the woman's movement, 
		and challenging them to take up the torch.<br><br>The Chicago Women's 
		Club was an example of a prominent and exclusive club and dedicated to 
		the movement's motto of &quot;Unity in Diversity&quot;. The Chicago Club was 
		credited with influencing the improvements in the city jails in 1906. 
		Political campaigning was not taboo, it was a time in America that women 
		made major contributions to reform, politics, child labor laws and 
		national life during a time that came to be called the Progressive Era.<br>
		<br>But, the Chicago Women's Club was an exception. Most women’s clubs 
		had their birth and growth from with the home, from the sitting rooms 
		and parlors of middle-class women. Most of these early women's clubs 
		were charitable, social, or literary groups. And, even the smaller clubs 
		in the smaller communities soon became involved in programs for 
		community improvement, which led them into reform.<br>There are 
		interesting comparisons with Rotary. One President of the Federation, 
		Ellen Henrotin described the movement as one not &quot;allied to any church 
		or any creed or any nation, but underlying them all.&quot; She went on: &quot;We 
		must live an applied Christianity. No greater service can be rendered 
		the world.&quot;<br><br>By the 1920's, the Women's clubs began declining as 
		the men had taken up the challenges laid down by women in the form of 
		Rotary and similar service clubs. Rotary’s role had changed from 
		‘boosting’ to ‘service.’ Yet, with a kind of selective blindness, the 
		men never acknowledged the role women played in 'service'.<br><br>Some 
		important women’s milestones that occurred during this period:<br><br>
		1866 - The Young Women's Christian Assoc. (YWCA) founded in Boston, MA<br>
		1869 - Wyoming Territory grants women the vote in all elections, the 
		first.<br>1889 - Jane Addams and Ellen Starr found Hull House in 
		Chicago, IL<br>1890 - General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC) - the 
		world's oldest nonpartisan, nondenominational women's volunteer service 
		organization - was founded in New York City by newspaperwoman Jane 
		Cunningham Croly<br>1903 - Women's Trade Union League founded to support 
		working women<br>1912 - Police close down Margaret Sanger's 
		birth-control clinic<br>1912 - Hadassah organized<br>1916 - Jeannette 
		Rankin (Montana) became the first woman elected to Congress<br>1917 - 
		National Woman's Party begins picketing White House for suffrage on July 
		14<br>1920 - 19th Amendment (Woman Suffrage) ratified, August 26<br>1920 
		- League of Women Voters founded<br>1920 - Women's Bureau of Dept. of 
		Labor formed<br><br>
