		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">Other than Jean Harris, the 
		earliest known instance of women participating in Rotary activities 
		occurred in 1911, with the founding of the Rotary Club of Belfast. the 
		Belfast club's existence, it was customary for members to bring their 
		wives to a monthly meeting.<br><br>The same Stuart Morrow who was a 
		member of the San Francisco club, started the Belfast club. Born in 
		Dublin in 1855, Stuart was a law graduate and a gold medalist from 
		Trinity College, Dublin. Towards the end of 1885, Stuart Morrow 
		emigrated to California, making his home and becoming involved in a 
		business in San Francisco. In 1909, a few months after the formation of 
		the Rotary Club of San Francisco, Stuart joined that Club under the 
		classification &quot;Collecting Agency&quot;.<br><br>Morrow 
		returned to Ireland in 1911. After establishing a Rotary club in Dublin, 
		he arrived in Belfast on July 13, 1911, and rapidly made contact with 
		possible candidates for membership in his proposed Rotary club for 
		Belfast. &quot;Self-appointed&quot; as the organizer, he convened a meeting of 
		interested men in the Royal Avenue Hotel, Belfast, on Monday, July 24, 
		at 1.15pm. Subsequently, they met on Monday, August 14, 1911, With 16 
		men attending, Will Wallace was elected the first president. In its 
		first roster of members, the club stated that it was to be &quot;a business 
		organization conducted on business lines for business purposes&quot;.<br><br>
		At that time, Belfast was a thriving industrial city of 400,000 
		inhabitants. It was the principal port, serving the predominantly 
		agricultural community, and was intensely proud of its world renowned 
		linen industry, the world's largest rope works, together with the 
		largest tobacco factory. Understandably, Belfast was also proud of its 
		granite build City Hall, its excellent hospitals and its famous Queen's 
		University.<br><br>Here was the fertile soil for the seeds of Rotary to 
		grow, and Stuart Morrow quickly secured 132 members to join the new 
		Club. In the year 1911, in which Belfast and Dublin were formed, so too 
		were the London and Manchester Clubs and together the four Clubs 
		collectively maintain an informal association of 1911 Clubs.<br><br>In 
		the first year of 1912, the club's Board of directors discussed the 
		advisability of electing women to membership or allowing them to attend 
		weekly luncheons. The club records of that period indicate the board 
		considered it undesirable to elect women to membership or have them at 
		the weekly luncheons. What is not known is whether that decision was 
		impacted by the possible admission into the National Association of 
		Rotary Clubs.<br><br>Neither Dublin nor Belfast was known to Paul Harris 
		or to the National Association of Rotary Clubs, and as a result neither 
		club received an official charter at the time of their foundation. When 
		Harris and Ches Perry finally heard about these clubs, they contacted 
		Morrow and authorized him to continue his work. In his fast-paced 
		movement around the British Isles, his next two clubs, in 1912, were 
		Glasgow and Edinburgh, and the following year, Liverpool and Birmingham, 
		making two in Ireland, two in Scotland and finally two in England.<br>
		<br>It was not for another 80 years after the founding of Belfast, in 
		1992, five years after the U.S. Supreme Court decision and three years 
		after Rotary changed its Constitution at the 1989 Council on 
		Legislation, that the first ladies were finally elected to membership in 
		the Club.<br><br>Had the Belfast Club admitted women in the summer of 
		1912, Rotary might have changed its policy when Dublin and Belfast were 
		admitted, and the U.S. Supreme Court would never have had to render a 
		decision.<br><br>Sources include the Club History of the Rotary Club of 
		Belfast, research by Calum Thomson, Basil Lewis and Doug Rudman, 
		'Towards by Neighbour' written by C.R. Hewitt, and 'Rotary International 
		in Great Britain and Ireland' by Roger Levy.</td>
