		<br>Looking Back in History<br>Women Formed a Rotary Club in 
		1911<br>by Rachael E. Martin, Club #25 Historian<br><br>Did you know 
		that Duluth women had a real Rotary Club in 1911? Here’s an article from 
		the 1912 Duluth News Tribune:<br><br>&quot;A woman’s Rotary club, not the 
		auxiliary society formed of the wives of Rotarians, but a real Rotary 
		club of women in business or professions, and a thriving club, too, 
		exists in Duluth. There is only one other woman’s Rotary club in America 
		and that is in Minneapolis.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mrs. Irene Buell is president of 
		the Duluth club; Dr. Sarah L. McClaran, Vice President; Dr. Mary Conrad, 
		Secretary and Treasurer; and Mrs. Jane Everington Scully, Chairman of 
		the Membership Committee.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The club was established about a year 
		ago and it is said that others, modeled after it, are about to be formed 
		in other cities.&quot;<br><br>Who was Mrs. Irene Buell, president of this 
		first Duluth women’s Rotary club? A Duluth Herald article from 1910 
		states that she was the first woman attorney in Duluth. The door of 
		office 419 in the Lonsdale building read &quot;I. C. Buell, Attorney at Law&quot;.<br>
		<br>Mrs. Buell came to Duluth in 1910 from the Twin Cities, where she 
		graduated from the Minnesota school of law and from the St. Paul law 
		school. She was admitted to the Minnesota bar and practiced law in the 
		Twin Cities for four years. She was the only full time woman attorney in 
		the Twin Cities at that time. Three other women had passed the Minnesota 
		bar, but combined their profession with other work.<br><br>The reporter 
		quoted Mrs. Buell in the 1910 article. &quot;There is a prejudice, of course, 
		against women in the profession. And in St. Paul it is very marked, in 
		fact sometimes they’re not quite courteous. I haven’t found it so thus 
		far in my week long residence in Duluth. Everyone has been quite 
		delightful. And by the way I never saw, any place, so many men remove 
		their hats in elevators in which there are women nor so many who hold 
		the doors open for women. It’s unusual, I think. I thought at first it 
		must be some mistake, but it doesn’t seem to be.&quot;<br><br>Mrs. Buell’s 
		father and brother were lawyers, and she wanted to be a lawyer, too, 
		ever since she was a child. She told the reporter, &quot;But I shouldn’t want 
		my son to become one. The law is too jealous a mistress. Graduation from 
		a law school is the most positive commencement in the real sense of the 
		word that I know. Study is everlasting and in the law you must not only 
		know one thing but everything, if you would represent your client well. 
		It is a never ending grind. I think there is easier work to be done.&quot;<br>
		<br>With the talented Mrs. Buell as president of Duluth’s first woman’s 
		Rotary club, surely their future was promising. What became of Mrs. 
		Buell and the woman’s Rotary club of Duluth? Hopefully, further research 
		will give us the answers.<br><br>Looking Back in History<br>The Women 
		Form Their Own Rotary Club 1911-1917<br>by Rachael E. Martin, Club #25 
		Historian<br><br>The Duluth Woman’s Rotary Club of 1911 left a faint 
		trail that vanished completely in 1917.<br><br>We have already heard 
		about the President, Irene C. Buell, who practiced law in Duluth from 
		1911 to 1915. Her offices moved from the Palladio Building to the 
		Christie Building, then to the Providence Building. By 1915 she left 
		Duluth and moved back to Minneapolis.<br><br>Another officer of the 
		woman’s club was Dr. Sarah McClaran, an osteopath with her husband, Dr. 
		William A. McClaran. Their office was at 124 W. Superior St., and they 
		lived at 1101 E. 3rd St. By 1914, Sarah moved away, and only her husband 
		and son, Melville, a student at the Duluth Business University, 
		continued to live in Duluth at 601 Woodland Ave. In 1918, William 
		McClaran changed professions and became Vice President of the Omaha Iron 
		Co. with Melville as Secretary Treasurer. William McClaran moved to 
		Minneapolis in 1920, the same year his son moved to 1405 London Road. By 
		1921, Melville also moved to Minneapolis.<br><br>A third officer, Dr. 
		Mary N. Conrad, was a chiropractor with an office in the Columbia 
		Building at 7 West Superior St. As a single woman, she lived in 
		apartments on 3rd Street through the 1920's. Then Dr. Conrad combined 
		her office and her residence in the Columbia Building until she left 
		Duluth in 1924.<br><br>The fourth of the early officers was Mrs. Jane 
		Everington Scully, a widow whose husband, George H. Scully, died in 
		1910. Mrs. Scully worked as a clerk at J.M. Gidding &amp; Co., a woman’s 
		apparel shop specializing in dry goods and cloaks located at the corner 
		of 1st Ave. West and Superior Street. She lived in an apartment at 
		Munger Terrace with her widowed mother and her brother James R. 
		Everington. In 1914, her mother died and Jane moved to the Wahldorf 
		Apartments at 218-220 1st Ave. W. Interestingly, in 1918 Jane Scully 
		changed her name back to Jane Everington. She continued to live in 
		Duluth until 1921 at 1215 E. 2nd St.<br><br>The Duluth Woman’s Rotary 
		Club continued meeting the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of every month at the 
		Spalding Hotel. Meanwhile, the Duluth Rotary Club #25 (the men’s club) 
		met the 1st Thursday of each month at noon and the last Thursday at 6:15 
		pm at various locations.<br><br>By 1914, Dr. Stella L. Wilkinson was 
		elected as the new secretary of the Duluth Woman’s Rotary Club. She was 
		a physician and surgeon with offices in the New Jersey Building at 
		106-112 W. Superior St. with office hours of 10:00-12:00 am and 
		2:00-5:00 pm.<br><br>In 1915 the women changed their meeting place to 
		the Club Room of the Duluth Public Library, located then at the NW 
		corner of 1st Ave. W &amp; 2nd St. Secretary Wilkinson used her office 
		address at the New Jersey Building as the Woman’s Rotary Club mailing 
		address. Dr. Wilkinson was not married and lived in apartments near her 
		office until 1924 when she moved to 4321 Luverne St. In 1925 she left 
		Duluth.<br><br>By 1917 the US entered the &quot;Great War&quot;, as WWI was 
		called, and club listings in the Duluth City Directory were replaced by 
		long lists of &quot;Soldier Boys&quot;. The Duluth Women’s Rotary Club was not 
		listed even after the war, although the Duluth Rotary Club #25 was 
		listed.<br><br>It appears that the woman’s club dissolved during or 
		shortly after WWI. None of the women officers remained in the Duluth 
		area, and President Irene Buell died in St. Paul in 1956.<br><br>This
