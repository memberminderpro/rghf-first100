		OF ROTARY INTERNATIONAL ET AL. v. ROTARY CLUB OF DUARTE ET AL.<br>APPEAL 
		FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA, SECOND APPELLATE DISTRICT<br>No. 
		86-421.<br><br>Argued March 30, 1987<br><br>Decided May 4, 1987 <br><br>
		Rotary International is a nonprofit corporation composed of local Rotary 
		Clubs. Its purposes are to provide humanitarian service, to encourage 
		high ethical standards in all vocations, and to help build world peace 
		and good will. Individuals are admitted to local club membership 
		according to a &quot;classification system&quot; based on business, professional, 
		and institutional activity in the community. Although women are 
		permitted to attend meetings, give speeches, receive awards, and form 
		auxiliary organizations, the Rotary constitution excludes women from 
		membership. Because it had admitted women to active membership, the 
		Duarte, California, Rotary Club's membership in the international 
		organization was terminated. That club and two of its women members 
		filed a suit alleging that the termination violated California's Unruh 
		Act (Act), which entitles all persons, regardless of sex, to full and 
		equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, and services 
		in all business establishments in the State. The state trial court 
		entered judgment for Rotary International, concluding that neither it 
		nor the Duarte Club is a &quot;business establishment&quot; within the meaning of 
		the Act. However, the State Court of Appeal reversed on this point, and 
		rejected the contention that Rotary's policy of excluding women is 
		protected by the First Amendment. Accordingly, the court ordered the 
		Duarte Club's reinstatement, and enjoined the enforcement of the gender 
		requirements against it.<br><br>Held: <br><br>1. The Unruh Act does not 
		violate the First Amendment by requiring California Rotary Clubs to 
		admit women. Pp. 544-549. <br><br>(a) Application of the Act to local 
		Rotary Clubs does not interfere unduly with club members' freedom of 
		private association. In determining whether a particular association is 
		sufficiently intimate or private to warrant constitutional protection, 
		consideration must be given to factors such as size, purpose, 
		selectivity, and whether others are excluded from critical aspects of 
		the relationship. Here, the relationship among Rotary Club members does 
		not warrant protection, in light of the potentially large size of local 
		clubs, the high turnover rate among club members, the inclusive nature 
		of each club's membership, the public purposes behind clubs' service 
		activities, and the fact that the clubs encourage the [481 U.S. 537, 
		538] participation of strangers in, and welcome media coverage of, many 
		of their central activities. Pp. 544-547. <br><br>(b) Application of the 
		Act to California Rotary Clubs does not violate the First Amendment 
		right of expressive association. Although clubs engage in a variety of 
		commendable service activities that are protected by the First 
		Amendment, the evidence fails to demonstrate that admitting women will 
		affect in any significant way the existing members' ability to carry out 
		those activities. Moreover, the Act does not require clubs to abandon or 
		alter their classification and admission systems, but, in fact, will 
		permit them to have an even more representative membership with a 
		broadened capacity for service. Even if the Act does work some slight 
		infringement of members' rights, that infringement is justified by the 
		State's compelling interests in eliminating discrimination against women 
		and in assuring them equal access to public accommodations. The latter 
		interest extends to the acquisition of leadership skills and business 
		contacts as well as tangible goods and services. Pp. 548-549. <br><br>2. 
		The contentions that the Act is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad 
		were not properly presented to the state courts, and therefore will not 
		be reviewed by this Court. Pp. 549-550. <br><br>178 Cal. App. 3d 1035, 
		224 Cal. Rptr. 213, affirmed. <br><br>POWELL, J., delivered the opinion 
		of the Court, in which REHNQUIST, C. J., and BRENNAN, WHITE, MARSHALL, 
		and STEVENS, JJ., joined. SCALIA, J., concurred in the judgment. 
		BLACKMUN and O'CONNOR, JJ., took no part in the consideration or 
		decision of the case. <br><br>William P. Sutter argued the cause for 
		appellants. With him on the briefs were Peter F. Lovato III and Wm. John 
		Kennedy. <br><br>Judith Resnik argued the cause for appellees. On the 
		brief were Carol Agate, Sanford K. Smith, Blanche C. Bersch, Paul 
		Hoffman, and Fred Okrand. <br><br>Marian M. Johnston argued the cause 
		for intervenor State of California. With her on the brief were John K. 
		Van de Kamp, Attorney General, Andrea Sheridan Ordin, Chief Assistant 
		Attorney General, and Beverly Tucker, Deputy Attorney General. * <br>

		delivered the opinion of the Court. <br><br>We must decide whether a 
		California statute that requires California Rotary Clubs to admit women 
		members violates the First Amendment. <br><br>I <br><br>A <br><br>Rotary 
		International (International) is a nonprofit corporation founded in 
		1905, with headquarters in Evanston, Illinois. It is &quot;an organization of 
		business and professional men united worldwide who provide humanitarian 
		service, encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and help 
		build goodwill and peace in the world.&quot; Rotary Manual of Procedure 7 
		(1981) (hereinafter Manual), App. 35. Individual members belong to a 
		local Rotary Club rather than to International. In turn, each local 
		Rotary Club is a member of International. Ibid. In August 1982, shortly 
		before the trial in this case, International [481 U.S. 537, 540] 
		comprised 19,788 Rotary Clubs in 157 countries, with a total membership 
		of about 907,750. Brief for Appellants 7. <br><br>Individuals are 
		admitted to membership in a Rotary Club according to a &quot;classification 
		system.&quot; The purpose of this system is to ensure &quot;that each Rotary Club 
		includes a representative of every worthy and recognized business, 
		professional, or institutional activity in the community.&quot; 2 Rotary 
		Basic Library, Club Service 67-69 (1981), App. 86. Each active member 
		must work in a leadership capacity in his business or profession. The 
		general rule is that &quot;one active member is admitted for each 
		classification, but he, in turn, may propose an additional active 
		member, who must be in the same business or professional 
		classification.&quot; 1 Id., at 7, App. 86. Thus, each classification may be 
		represented by two active members. In addition, &quot;senior active&quot; and 
		&quot;past service&quot; members may represent the same classifications as active 
		members. See Standard Rotary Club Constitution, Art. V, 2-5, Record 
		97-98. There is no limit to the number of clergymen, journalists, or 
		diplomats who may be admitted to membership. Manual 31, 33, App. 38-39.
		<br><br>Subject to these requirements, each local Rotary Club is free to 
		adopt its own rules and procedures for admitting new members. Id., at 7, 
		App. 35. International has promulgated Recommended Club By-laws 
		providing that candidates for membership will be considered by both a 
		&quot;classifications committee&quot; and a &quot;membership committee.&quot; The 
		classifications committee determines whether the candidate's business or 
		profession is described accurately and fits an &quot;open&quot; classification. 
		The membership committee evaluates the candidate's &quot;character, business 
		and social standing, and general [481 U.S. 537, 541] eligibility.&quot; Brief 
		for Appellants 7-8. If any member objects to the candidate's admission, 
		the final decision is made by the club's board of directors. <br><br>
		Membership in Rotary Clubs is open only to men. Standard Rotary Club 
		Constitution, Art. V, 2, Record 97. Herbert A. Pigman, the General 
		Secretary of Rotary International, testified that the exclusion of women 
		results in an &quot;aspect of fellowship . . . that is enjoyed by the present 
		male membership,&quot; App. to Juris. Statement G-52, and also allows Rotary 
		to operate effectively in foreign countries with varied cultures and 
		social mores. Although women are not admitted to membership, they are 
		permitted to attend meetings, give speeches, and receive awards. Women 
		relatives of Rotary members may form their own associations, and are 
		authorized to wear the Rotary lapel pin. Young women between 14 and 28 
		years of age may join Interact or Rotaract, organizations sponsored by 
		Rotary International. <br><br>B <br><br>In 1977 the Rotary Club of 
		Duarte, California, admitted Donna Bogart, Mary Lou Elliott, and 
		Rosemary Freitag to active membership. International notified the Duarte 
		Club that admitting women members is contrary to the Rotary 
		constitution. After an internal hearing, International's board of 
		directors revoked the charter of the Duarte Club and terminated its 
		membership in Rotary International. The Duarte Club's appeal to the 
		International Convention was unsuccessful. <br><br>The Duarte Club and 
		two of its women members filed a complaint in the California Superior 
		Court for the County of Los Angeles. The complaint alleged, inter alia, 
		that appellants' actions violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. 
		Code Ann. 51 (West 1982). 2 Appellees sought to enjoin [481 U.S. 537, 
		542] International from enforcing its restrictions against admitting 
		women members, revoking the Duarte Club's charter, or compelling 
		delivery of the charter to any representative of International. 
		Appellees also sought a declaration that appellants' actions had 
		violated the Unruh Act. After a bench trial, the court concluded that 
		neither Rotary International nor the Duarte Club is a &quot;business 
		establishment&quot; within the meaning of the Unruh Act. The court recognized 
		that &quot;some individual Rotarians derive sufficient business advantage 
		from Rotary to warrant deduction of Rotarian expenses in income tax 
		calculations, or to warrant payment of those expenses by their employers 
		. . . .&quot; App. to Juris. Statement B-3. But it found that &quot;such business 
		benefits are incidental to the principal purposes of the association . . 
		. to promote fellowship . . . and . . . `service' activities.&quot; Ibid. The 
		court also found that Rotary clubs do not provide their members with 
		goods, services, or facilities. On the basis of these findings and 
		conclusions, the court entered judgment for International. <br><br>The 
		California Court of Appeal reversed. 178 Cal. App. 3d 1035, 224 Cal. 
		Rptr. 213 (1986). It held that both Rotary International and the Duarte 
		Rotary Club are business establishments subject to the provisions of the 
		Unruh Act. For purposes of the Act, a &quot;`business' embraces everything 
		about which one can be employed,&quot; and an &quot;establishment&quot; includes &quot;not 
		only a fixed location, . . . but also a permanent `commercial force or 
		organization' or a `permanent settled position (as in life or 
		business).'&quot; O'Connor v. Village Green Owners Assn., 33 Cal. 3d 790, 
		795, 662 P.2d 427, 430 (1983) (quoting Burks v. Poppy Construction Co., 
		57 Cal. 2d 463, 468-469, 370 P.2d 313, 316 (1962)). The Court of Appeal 
		identified several &quot;businesslike attributes&quot; of Rotary International, 
		including its complex structure, large staff and budget, and extensive 
		[481 U.S. 537, 543] publishing activities. The court held that the trial 
		court had erred in finding that the business advantages afforded by 
		membership in a local Rotary Club are merely incidental. It stated that 
		testimony by members of the Duarte Club &quot;leaves no doubt that business 
		concerns are a motivating factor in joining local clubs,&quot; and that 
		&quot;business benefits [are] enjoyed and capitalized upon by Rotarians and 
		their businesses or employers.&quot; 178 Cal. App. 3d, at 1057, 224 Cal. 
		Rptr., at 226. The Court of Appeal rejected the trial court's finding 
		that the Duarte Club does not provide goods, services, or facilities to 
		its members. In particular, the court noted that members receive copies 
		of the Rotary magazine and numerous other Rotary publications, are 
		entitled to wear and display the Rotary emblem, and may attend 
		conferences that teach managerial and professional techniques. <br><br>
		The court also held that membership in Rotary International or the 
		Duarte Club does not give rise to a &quot;continuous, personal, and social&quot; 
		relationship that &quot;take[s] place more or less outside public view.&quot; 
		Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The court 
		further concluded that admitting women to the Duarte Club would not 
		seriously interfere with the objectives of Rotary International. 
		Finally, the court rejected appellants' argument that their policy of 
		excluding women is protected by the First Amendment principles set out 
		in Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609 (1984). It observed 
		that &quot;[n]othing we have said prevents, or can prevent, International 
		from adopting or attempting to enforce membership rules or restrictions 
		outside of this state.&quot; Id., at 1066, 224 Cal. Rptr., at 231. The court 
		ordered appellants to reinstate the Duarte Club as a member of Rotary 
		International, and permanently enjoined them from enforcing or 
		attempting to enforce the gender requirement against the Duarte Club.
		<br><br>The California Supreme Court denied appellants' petition for 
		review. We postponed consideration of our jurisdiction to the hearing on 
		the merits. 479 U.S. 929 (1986). We [481 U.S. 537, 544] conclude that we 
		have appellate jurisdiction, 3 and affirm the judgment of the Court of 
		Appeal. <br><br>II <br><br>In Roberts v. United States Jaycees, supra, 
		we upheld against First Amendment challenge a Minnesota statute that 
		required the Jaycees to admit women as full voting members. Roberts 
		provides the framework for analyzing appellants' constitutional claims. 
		As we observed in Roberts, our cases have afforded constitutional 
		protection to freedom of association in two distinct senses. First, the 
		Court has held that the Constitution protects against unjustified 
		government interference with an individual's choice to enter into and 
		maintain certain intimate or private relationships. Second, the Court 
		has upheld the freedom of individuals to associate for the purpose of 
		engaging in protected speech or religious activities. In many cases, 
		government interference with one form of protected association will also 
		burden the other form of association. In Roberts we determined the 
		nature and degree of constitutional protection by considering separately 
		the effect of the challenged state action on individuals' freedom [481 
		U.S. 537, 545] of private association and their freedom of expressive 
		association. We follow the same course in this case. 4 <br><br>A <br>
		<br>The Court has recognized that the freedom to enter into and carry on 
		certain intimate or private relationships is a fundamental element of 
		liberty protected by the Bill of Rights. Such relationships may take 
		various forms, including the most intimate. See Moore v. East Cleveland, 
		431 U.S. 494, 503 -504 (1977) (plurality opinion). We have not attempted 
		to mark the precise boundaries of this type of constitutional 
		protection. The intimate relationships to which we have accorded 
		constitutional protection include marriage, Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 
		U.S. 374, 383 -386 (1978); the begetting and bearing of children, Carey 
		v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 678, 684 -686 (1977); 
		child rearing and education, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 
		534 -535 (1925); and cohabitation with relatives, Moore v. East 
		Cleveland, supra, at 503-504. Of course, we have not held that 
		constitutional protection is restricted to relationships among family 
		members. We have emphasized that the First Amendment protects those 
		relationships, including family relationships, that presuppose &quot;deep 
		attachments and commitments to the necessarily few other individuals 
		with whom one shares not only a special community of thoughts, 
		experiences, and beliefs but also distinctively personal aspects of 
		one's life.&quot; Roberts v. United States Jaycees, supra, at 619-620. But in 
		Roberts we observed that &quot;[d]etermining the limits of state authority 
		over an individual's freedom to enter into a particular association . . 
		. unavoidably entails a careful [481 U.S. 537, 546] assessment of where 
		that relationship's objective characteristics locate it on a spectrum 
		from the most intimate to the most attenuated of personal attachments.&quot; 
		468 U.S., at 620 (citing Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 187 -189 
		(1976) (POWELL, J., concurring)). In determining whether a particular 
		association is sufficiently personal or private to warrant 
		constitutional protection, we consider factors such as size, purpose, 
		selectivity, and whether others are excluded from critical aspects of 
		the relationship. 468 U.S., at 620 .<br><br>The evidence in this case 
		indicates that the relationship among Rotary Club members is not the 
		kind of intimate or private relation that warrants constitutional 
		protection. The size of local Rotary Clubs ranges from fewer than 20 to 
		more than 900. App. to Juris. Statement G-15 (deposition of Herbert A. 
		Pigman, General Secretary of Rotary International). There is no upper 
		limit on the membership of any local Rotary Club. About 10 percent of 
		the membership of a typical club moves away or drops out during a 
		typical year. 2 Rotary Basic Library, Club Service 9-11 (1981), App. 88. 
		The clubs therefore are instructed to &quot;keep a flow of prospects coming&quot; 
		to make up for the attrition and gradually to enlarge the membership. 
		Ibid. The purpose of Rotary &quot;is to produce an inclusive, not exclusive, 
		membership, making possible the recognition of all useful local 
		occupations, and enabling the club to be a true cross section of the 
		business and professional life of the community.&quot; 1 Rotary Basic 
		Library, Focus on Rotary 60-61 (1981), App. 84. The membership 
		undertakes a variety of service projects designed to aid the community, 
		to raise the standards of the members' businesses and professions, and 
		to improve international relations. 5 Such an inclusive [481 U.S. 537, 
		547] &quot;fellowship for service based on diversity of interest,&quot; ibid., 
		however beneficial to the members and to those they serve, does not 
		suggest the kind of private or personal relationship to which we have 
		accorded protection under the First Amendment. To be sure, membership in 
		Rotary Clubs is not open to the general public. But each club is 
		instructed to include in its membership &quot;all fully qualified prospective 
		members located within its territory,&quot; to avoid &quot;arbitrary limits on the 
		number of members in the club,&quot; and to &quot;establish and maintain a 
		membership growth pattern.&quot; Manual 139, App. 61-62.<br><br>Many of the 
		Rotary Clubs' central activities are carried on in the presence of 
		strangers. Rotary Clubs are required to admit any member of any other 
		Rotary Club to their meetings. Members are encouraged to invite business 
		associates and competitors to meetings. At some Rotary Clubs, the 
		visitors number &quot;in the tens and twenties each week.&quot; App. to Juris. 
		Statement G-24 (deposition of Herbert A. Pigman, General Secretary of 
		Rotary International). Joint meetings with the members of other 
		organizations, and other joint activities, are permitted. The clubs are 
		encouraged to seek coverage of their meetings and activities in local 
		newspapers. In sum, Rotary Clubs, rather than carrying on their 
		activities in an atmosphere of privacy, seek to keep their &quot;windows and 
		doors open to the whole world,&quot; 1 Rotary Basic Library, Focus on Rotary 
		60-61 (1981), App. 85. We therefore conclude that application of the 
		Unruh Act to local Rotary Clubs does not interfere unduly with the 
		members' freedom of private association. 6 [481 U.S. 537, 548] <br><br>B
		<br><br>The Court also has recognized that the right to engage in 
		activities protected by the First Amendment implies &quot;a corresponding 
		right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of 
		political, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends.&quot; 
		Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S., at 622 . See NAACP v. 
		Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 907 -909, 932-933 (1982). For this 
		reason, &quot;[i]mpediments to the exercise of one's right to choose one's 
		associates can violate the right of association protected by the First 
		Amendment . . . .&quot; Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 80 , n. 4 
		(1984) (POWELL, J., concurring) (citing NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415 
		(1963); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449 (1958)). In 
		this case, however, the evidence fails to demonstrate that admitting 
		women to Rotary Clubs will affect in any significant way the existing 
		members' ability to carry out their various purposes. <br><br>As a 
		matter of policy, Rotary Clubs do not take positions on &quot;public 
		questions,&quot; including political or international issues. Manual 115, 
		App. 58-59. To be sure, Rotary Clubs engage in a variety of commendable 
		service activities that are protected by the First Amendment. But the 
		Unruh Act does not require the clubs to abandon or alter any of these 
		activities. It does not require them to abandon their basic goals of 
		humanitarian service, high ethical standards in all vocations, good 
		will, and peace. Nor does it require them to abandon their 
		classification system or admit members who do not reflect a cross 
		section of the community. Indeed, by [481 U.S. 537, 549] opening 
		membership to leading business and professional women in the community, 
		Rotary Clubs are likely to obtain a more representative cross section of 
		community leaders with a broadened capacity for service. 7 <br><br>Even 
		if the Unruh Act does work some slight infringement on Rotary members' 
		right of expressive association, that infringement is justified because 
		it serves the State's compelling interest in eliminating discrimination 
		against women. See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 25 (1976) (per curiam) 
		(right of association may be limited by state regulations necessary to 
		serve a compelling interest unrelated to the suppression of ideas). On 
		its face the Unruh Act, like the Minnesota public accommodations law we 
		considered in Roberts, makes no distinctions on the basis of the 
		organization's viewpoint. Moreover, public accommodations laws &quot;plainly 
		serv[e] compelling state interests of the highest order.&quot; 468 U.S., at 
		624 . In Roberts we recognized that the State's compelling interest in 
		assuring equal access to women extends to the acquisition of leadership 
		skills and business contacts as well as tangible goods and services. 
		Id., at 626. The Unruh Act plainly serves this interest. We therefore 
		hold that application of the Unruh Act to California Rotary Clubs does 
		not violate the right of expressive association afforded by the First 
		Amendment. 8 <br><br>III <br><br>Finally, appellants contend that the 
		Unruh Act is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. We conclude that 
		these contentions were not properly presented to the state courts. [481 
		U.S. 537, 550] It is well settled that this Court will not review a 
		final judgment of a state court unless &quot;the record as a whole shows 
		either expressly or by clear implication that the federal claim was 
		adequately presented in the state system.&quot; Webb v. Webb, 451 U.S. 493, 
		496 -497 (1981). Appellants did not present the issues squarely to the 
		state courts until they filed their petition for rehearing with the 
		Court of Appeal. The court denied the petition without opinion. When 
		&quot;`&quot;the highest state court has failed to pass upon a federal question, 
		it will be assumed that the omission was due to want of proper 
		presentation in the state courts, unless the aggrieved party in this 
		Court can affirmatively show the contrary.&quot;'&quot; Exxon Corp. v. Eagerton, 
		462 U.S. 176, 181 , n. 3 (1983) (quoting Fuller v. Oregon, 417 U.S. 40, 
		50 , n. 11 (1974) (in turn quoting Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576, 582 
		(1969))). Appellants have made no such showing in this case. 9 <br><br>
		IV <br><br>The judgment of the Court of Appeal of California is 
		affirmed. <br><br>It is so ordered. <br><br>JUSTICE SCALIA concurs in 
		the judgment. <br><br>JUSTICE BLACKMUN and JUSTICE O'CONNOR took no part 
		in the consideration or decision of this case.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>[ 
		Footnote 1 ] Rotary Clubs may establish separate classifications for 
		subcategories of a business or profession as long as the classification 
		&quot;describe[s] the member's principal and recognized professional activity 
		. . . .&quot; 2 Rotary Basic Library, Club Service 8 (1981), App. 87. For 
		example, a single Rotary Club may admit categories and subcategories of 
		lawyers: e. g., trial, corporate, tax, labor, and so on. Ibid. <br><br>[ 
		Footnote 2 ] The Unruh Civil Rights Act provides, in part: <br><br>&quot;All 
		persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no 
		matter what their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, or national 
		origin [481 U.S. 537, 542] are entitled to the full and equal 
		accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all 
		business establishments of every kind whatsoever.&quot; Cal. Civ. Code Ann. 
		51 (West 1982). <br><br>[ Footnote 3 ] We have appellate jurisdiction to 
		review a final judgment entered by the highest court of a State in which 
		decision could be had &quot;where is drawn in question the validity of a 
		statute of any state on the ground of its being repugnant to the 
		Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, and the decision is 
		in favor of its validity.&quot; 28 U.S.C. 1257(2). Appellants squarely 
		challenged the constitutionality of the Unruh Act, as applied, and the 
		Court of Appeal sustained the validity of the statute as applied. &quot;We 
		have held consistently that a state statute is sustained within the 
		meaning of 1257(2) when a state court holds it applicable to a 
		particular set of facts as against the contention that such application 
		is invalid on federal grounds.&quot; Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los 
		Angeles, 441 U.S. 434, 441 (1979) (citing Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 
		15, 17 -18 (1971); Warren Trading Post v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 380 U.S. 
		685, 686 , and n. 1 (1965); Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 
		61 , n. 3 (1963); Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, 257 U.S. 282, 
		288 -290 (1921)). <br><br>[ Footnote 4 ] International, an association 
		of thousands of local Rotary Clubs, can claim no constitutionally 
		protected right of private association. Moreover, its expressive 
		activities are quite limited. See infra, at 548-549. Because the Court 
		of Appeal held that the Duarte Rotary Club also is a business 
		establishment subject to the provisions of the Unruh Act, we proceed to 
		consider whether application of the Unruh Act violates the rights of 
		members of local Rotary Clubs. <br><br>[ Footnote 5 ] We of course 
		recognize that Rotary Clubs, like similar organizations, perform useful 
		and important community services. Rotary Clubs in the vicinity of the 
		Duarte Club have provided meals and transportation to the elderly, 
		vocational guidance for high school students, a swimming program for 
		handicapped children, and international exchange programs, among many 
		other service activities. Record 217H-217J. <br><br>[ Footnote 6 ] 
		Appellants assert that we &quot;approved&quot; a distinction between the Jaycees 
		and the Kiwanis Club in Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 
		630 (1984). Brief for Appellants 21. Appellants misconstrue Roberts. In 
		that case we observed that the Minnesota court had suggested Kiwanis 
		Clubs were outside the scope of the State's public accommodations law. 
		We concluded that this refuted the Jaycees' arguments that the Minnesota 
		statute was vague and overbroad. We did not consider whether the 
		relationship among members of the Kiwanis Club was sufficiently intimate 
		or private to warrant constitutional protection. Similarly, [481 U.S. 
		537, 548] we have no occasion in this case to consider the extent to 
		which the First Amendment protects the right of individuals to associate 
		in the many clubs and other entities with selective membership that are 
		found throughout the country. Whether the &quot;zone of privacy&quot; established 
		by the First Amendment extends to a particular club or entity requires a 
		careful inquiry into the objective characteristics of the particular 
		relationships at issue. Roberts v. United States Jaycees, supra, at 620. 
		Cf. Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 179 -180 (1972) 
		(Douglas, J., dissenting). <br><br>[ Footnote 7 ] In 1980 women were 
		reported to make up 40.6 percent of the managerial and professional 
		labor force in the United States. U.S. Department of Commerce, 
		Statistical Abstract of the United States 400 (1986). <br><br>[ Footnote 
		8 ] Appellants assert that admission of women will impair Rotary's 
		effectiveness as an international organization. This argument is 
		undercut by the fact that the legal effect of the judgment of the 
		California Court of Appeal is limited to the State of California. See 
		supra, at 543. Appellants' argument also is undermined by the fact that 
		women already attend the Rotary Clubs' meetings and participate in many 
		of their activities. <br><br>[ Footnote 9 ] Appellants point to a 
		passage in the brief they filed in the California Court of Appeal that 
		quotes this Court's opinion in NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 435 
		(1963): &quot;`It is enough [for unconstitutionality] that a vague and broad 
		statute lends itself to selective enforcement against unpopular 
		causes.'&quot; Brief for Respondents in B001663 (Cal. Ct. App.), p. 26 
		(brackets in original) (quoted in Brief for Appellants 37-37). The 
		quotation occurs in the course of an argument that the Unruh Act should 
		be applied only to memberships in entities that are a vehicle for the 
		public sale of goods, services, or commercial advantages. This casual 
		reference to a federal case, in the midst of an unrelated argument, is 
		insufficient to inform a state court that it has been presented with a 
		claim subject to our appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1257(2).
