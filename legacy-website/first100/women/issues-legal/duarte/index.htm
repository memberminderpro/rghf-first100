		Gabriel Mountains. <br>Between Monrovia and Azusa on Route 66, <br>about 20

		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/issues-early/images/duartelogo.jpg" style="float: left">With only eight members, including 
		the Superintendent of Schools Dr. Richard Key, the club votes to invite 
		three women to join the club. Two school principals, Mary Lou Elliott 
		and Donna Bogart joined the same day. Just a few months later, in the 
		spring of 1977, psychologist Rosemary Freitag became the third woman 
		member of Duarte. The club had nearly increased 50 percent in size with 
		the addition of women. <br><br>The late Paul G. Bryan, from Pasadena, 
		was the Governor of 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/districts/districts/5300.htm">District 530</a> (now 5300) in 1976-1977. On his advice, 
		the club listed the women with only their initials for their first names 
		and the data was sent to Rotary International. <br><br>On 
		June 1, 1977, the Duarte club held its 25th Anniversary Celebration. In 
		front of the backdrop of RI officialdom, who were present for the 
		celebration, the three women were introduced as members. Needless to 
		say, official Rotary International representatives expressed alarm at 
		the presence of women in the Duarte club. Word spread rapidly throughout 
		Rotary International. Requests to terminate the women were rejected by 
		the club. <br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/issues-early/images/icnchr66.gif" style="float: left">Eight months later, in February of 1978, Rotary 
		International revoked the charter of the Duarte club. The club requested 
		a hearing with RI's Board of Directors. The Board told Duarte that it 
		must remove women members. They refused again. Undaunted, the club 
		members raised funds to send a club member, Luke McJimpson, to Tokyo for 
		the next Council on Legislation. The club began fund raising in earnest, 
		and the entire Duarte community supported the fundraisers. <br><br>On 
		March 27, 1978, the Rotary International Board of Directors officially 
		revoked the Charter of the Duarte club after the appeals process was 
		concluded. <br><br>Duarte member Luke McJimpson flew to Tokyo for the 
		Council on Legislation. His instruction from the club was that they 
		would take no legal action before appealing to Rotary’s Council on 
		Legislation. Jack Davis, President of Rotary International wrote the 
		COL, &quot;The unity of Rotary International was jeopardized by a single 
		club's unilateral move to change bylaws.&quot; <br><br>The matter is heard 
		and discussed. The vote is 1060 to 34 against changing the constitution 
		of Rotary International to admit women to Rotary. That vote upheld the 
		previous decision of Rotary International's Board of Directors. <br><br>
		Upon McJimpson’s return, the entire club met, and decided to continue to 
		meet as a quasi-Rotary Club. An X was placed over the Rotary insignia, 
		new pins were made, and the club was called: The Ex-Rotary Club of 
		Duarte. <br><br>A month later, in June of 1978, the Rotary Club of 
		Duarte, California, filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court, helped by 
		Sanford Smith, an attorney from a neighboring Rotary Club, and Carl 
		Agate, a member of the American Civil Liberties Union. <br><br>
		Immediately upon service, Rotary International’s attorney petitioned to 
		transfer the California State Court suit to federal court, using the 
		theory that all Rotary International board members are not Californians. 
		If jurisdiction had been changed to Federal court, the Rotary 
		International board would have gained the advantage of a 1976 Federal 
		court decision which upheld exclusionary rules for private clubs. 
		However, the Federal court rules that the battle be fought back in state 
		court. <br><br>The case finally goes to trial in 1983. California State 
		Judge Max Deutz refused to reinstate the club. The Duarte club 
		immediately appealed the decision. In 1986, the State Appeals Court 
		reversed Judge Deutz, stating that Rotary Clubs are business 
		establishments subject to regulation under the state's Unruh Act which 
		bans discrimination based on race, gender, religion or ethnic origin.
		<br><br>Rotary International immediately appealed the case to the 
		California Supreme Court. That court then refused to hear the case, 
		meaning that they agreed with the State Appeals Court ruling reversing 
		Deutz. <br><br>Rotary International then appealed the decision to the U. 
		S. Supreme Court. The RI attorney argued, &quot;…threatens to force us to 
		take in everyone, like a motel.&quot; <br><br>Unbeknownst to the Duarte club, 
		the Seattle-International District club, on July 31, 1986, had 
		unanimously voted to admit women. Because it was believed that admitting 
		only one or two women would create pressure on those individuals, the 
		Seattle-ID club decided to admit several women, and ultimately 15 were 
		proposed and admitted. <br><br>In order to prevent their charter being 
		revoked by RI like that of Duarte, the Seattle-ID club kept silent about 
		its admission of women until it was ready to seek an injunction in 
		Federal court, to prevent expulsion. In September, 1986, the Club hired 
		Margaret McKeown of the Perkins Coie law firm as counsel, filed its 
		suit, and announced its admission of the women. Subsequently, Seattle-ID 
		joined Duarte in the Supreme Court case. <br><br>
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/issues-legal">The United States 
		Supreme Court</a>, on May 4, 1987, affirmed the 1986 ruling of the Court of 
		Appeals of California in a 7 - 0 opinion. There was widespread media 
		publicity worldwide. However, there was no communication from Rotary 
		International until the 1987-1988 Rotary year, when the Duarte club 
		received an invoice/recap sheet to list existing members as of June 30, 
		1987, and pay international dues based on the membership as of that 
		date. To this day, that invoice remains the only communication from the 
		Rotary International Board of Directors or the Secretariat regarding the 
		end of the Duarte charter revocation and its reinstatement in Rotary 
		International.<br><br>However, by the time that the Duarte case went to 
		the U. S. Supreme Court, things had changed in District 530 regarding 
		the Duarte club. Of the three original women, only Mary Lou Elliott 
		remained. Rosemary Freitag had moved out of California, and Donna Bogart 
		had moved to Fresno to take over a school there. The club had continued 
		to welcome women as members, and its membership included Marabelle 
		Taylor, Elaine Benthuys, Donna Georgino and Sylvia Whitlock, along with 
		Elliott. In fact Whitlock, who joined in 1982, was the club’s 
		president-elect in 1986-87. <br><br>In late fall of 1986, District 530 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/clubpresidents/dg.htm">Governor Tim Keen Siu</a> sent to the Duarte Club and incoming president 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/clubpresidents/index.htm">Sylvia Whitlock</a> an invitation to attend California PETs and a notice of 
		the district dues schedule. <br><br>California PETs took place in 
		February, 1987, prior to the United States Supreme Court decision. 
		However, it was incumbent on all California clubs to obey the ruling of 
		the State Court of Appeals. At PETs, the attendance included 310 men and 
		one woman, Sylvia Whitlock, and all were requested to bring a coat and 
		tie for pictures to be taken. 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/clubpresidents/dg.htm">District 530 Governor John Fee</a>, in the 
		district session, told of the Duarte Club's actions, the court ruling, 
		and the decision of Rotary International to appeal to the Supreme Court 
		of the United States. His comment was, in direct reference to the club's 
		small number, &quot;This is a case of the mouse that roared.&quot; <br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/clubpresidents/images/index1.jpg" style="float: left">The 
		club, in deference to their pride in the &quot;roar,&quot; chose that phrase to 
		appear on the club's new banner.<br><br>Sylvia Whitlock served as 
		president of Duarte for the 1987-1988 Rotary year, although she was 
		unable to attend the International Convention in Munich, coming just one 
		month after the Supreme Court decision. <br><br>She had extremely 
		positive things to say about her District Governor, Tim Keen Siu, and 
		he, and the rest of the district leadership, made her feel welcome. She 
		was the first woman club president in the world, although RI did not 
		officially change its constitution and bylaws admitting women until 
		January of 1989, and they did not take effect until July 1, 1989. <br>
		<br>During her year, Whitlock was invited to a Rotary Foundation 
		reception in early 1988. It was held on the Spruce Goose in Long Beach. 
		There, the first woman president met Charles Keller, the president of 
		Rotary International. Warm and cordial, Keller demonstrated that the war 
		was truly over, and that women were welcomed to Rotary. Finally, in 
		June, 1988, Sylvia Whitlock attended her first International Convention, 
		in Philadelphia. She was the first woman President to attend an 
		international convention. <br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/issues-early/images/duartecomposit.jpg" style="float: left">To this day, Sylvia Whitlock still 
		serves the Duarte club as secretary, the club celebrated its 50th 
		Anniversary on June 1, 2002, Mary Lou Elliott has retired and moved to 
		La Jolla, California, and women still are a critical part of the spirit 
		of “The Mouse That Roared, the Rotary Club Of Duarte.”<br><br>Researched 
		by noted western scene painter Joseph Holbrook is part of historically 
		accurate scenes reproduced in oils commissioned by the Duarte City 
		Council for exhibit in the Duarte City Hall. Suitable for framing, this 
		reproduction includes the boundaries of the original Asuksa Indian 
		Tribe, a branch of the Shoshone Nation; reference to the now famous 
		DeAnza Expedition; the contour of the Andres Duarte Rancho and how the 
		original cattle brand used by Duarte is today the official Logo for the 
		City of Duarte.<br><br>Rotary Club of Oakland #3 wrote to the general 
		secretary for an explanation of Duarte's loss of their charter.<br>
		<br>An addition/correction by PDG Sylvia Whitlock 2014 &quot;In the section 
		of the Duarte story where it mentions PETS, it was not DG Tim Siu who 
		spoke to the case, it was DG John Fee who said, &quot;It's just a case of the 
		mouse that roared&quot;. I was sitting there and took that statement back, 
		and had it placed on our banner. Tim Siu was the DGE. He later came and 
		installed me as President, something he was proud of until the day he 
		died. He never passed up an opportunity to talk about it.&quot;</td>
