		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/issues-legal/seattle/images/pioneersquare.jpg" style="float: left">People everywhere have heard 
		of “Skid Row.” Pioneer Square in Seattle was the home of the original 
		&quot;Skid Road,&quot; the original term, born when timber was slid down Yesler 
		Way to a steam-powered mill on the waterfront.<br><br>Seattle's oldest 
		neighborhood, historic Pioneer Square gets its character from the sturdy 
		red brick buildings that have endured boom, bust, renewal and 
		renovation. Through it all, the area has maintained the grace that hints 
		of upper class regency England.<br><br>Today, the area is home and 
		neighborhood to many of Seattle's art galleries, eateries and web 
		development companies. It is also the entertainment district of Seattle, 
		and it comes alive when the sun sets across the peninsula in the Pacific 
		Ocean. The historic district becomes entertainment district, with one of 
		the city's liveliest collections of nightspots, from sports bars to hard 
		rock taverns to romantic eateries. Just south of Pioneer Square is the 
		International District, where many former immigrants from the Pacific 
		Rim own thriving businesses that proudly proclaim their multi-cultural 
		heritages.<br><br>In 1984, Carl E. Swenson, Governor of District 5030, 
		wanted to start a club in the Pioneer Square-International District 
		area. He asked Lloyd Hara, a member of Seattle4, to be his Special 
		Representative to the new club.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/issues-legal/seattle/images/pioneesqtrolley.jpg" style="float: left">Hara began immediately. He talked 
		to people in the area, and quickly assembled a possible profile. He felt 
		that the club could be highly diversified and multi-ethnic in 
		membership, if it fairly represented the business people in the 
		International District and Pioneer Square.<br><br>The chartering members 
		agreed with most all of the provisions from Rotary International to 
		charter a new club except a major one. They voted to change the club 
		charter application, from the standard Rotary charter, by crossing out 
		any reference to membership by males or men.<br><br>The Secretariat of 
		Rotary International returned the application unapproved because of the 
		deletion of the male gender clause, and a few other minor elements that 
		were changed to comply with the interests and backgrounds of the 
		proposed members. A debate ensued amongst the prospective members. They 
		argued whether to accept the traditional charter language or fight. 
		Universally, they loved the concept of Rotary, they just had some 
		questions about the way it was being run. Finally, they reached 
		consensus by approving the standard charter language. They decided that 
		they would then submit a resolution to change the by-laws of Rotary 
		International, by admitting women, at the 1986 Council on Legislation.<br>

		<br><br>The prospective club continued to meet provisionally in regular 
		meetings for six months. Finally, on September 18, 1984, the club was 
		chartered. On its charter it was named the Rotary Club of Seattle - 
		International District. The Governor’s Special Representative, Lloyd 
		Hara, became the chartering president. subsequently, he recalled, &quot;We 
		ran the usual luncheon program, but had a higher degree of political and 
		community-related issues. We also visited each other's businesses, 
		somewhat like an open house, in order to get to know each other better.&quot; 
		In other words, they took the early words of Paul Harris to heart, and 
		believed in Harris’ model for Rotary.<br><br>
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/issues-legal/seattle/images/sircbanner.jpg">
		<img class="auto-style28" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/women/issues-legal/seattle/images/sircbanner.jpg" style="float: left"></a>The new club was very 
		multicultural, and considerably younger than most clubs. The majority of 
		the members were in their 30's and early 40's. Only Hara and one other 
		member had been Rotarians previously. It was a new group of people that 
		were challenged to get involved. It probably was a contributing factor 
		to the effort to permit women members in Rotary.<br><br>The board soon 
		formed a Women-in-Rotary committee. It investigated alternatives and 
		studied procedures for amending the Rotary constitution to admit women 
		as full members. When every one of the “Women-in-Rotary “proposed 
		amendments were overwhelmingly defeated at the Council on Legislation in 
		1986, club members were insulted and irate. They decided not to wait 
		until the next Constitutional convention, but take action on their own, 
		if 100 percent of the membership agreed with their challenge to Rotary 
		International.<br><br>

		story, “On July 31, 1986, the club unanimously voted to admit women. 
		Members such as Bob Hashimoto spoke against discrimination. Because it 
		was believed that admitting only one or two women would create pressure 
		on those individuals, it was decided to admit several women. Ultimately 
		15 women were proposed and admitted.”<br><br>Admission of the original 
		women members occurred on September 4, 1986. They included Kay Blackard, 
		Director of Education at Harborview Medical Center, Cynthia Chirot, 
		Senior Vice-President of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle; Harriet 
		Cody, Attorney-at-law; Reidun Crowley, Customer Programs Administrator 
		of Puget Power; Katherine Fletcher, the Chair of the Puget Sound Water 
		Quality Authority, Patricia Frank, Executive Director of Puget Sound Big 
		Sisters; Canadian Consulate General Executive Jane Hardeson; Carol 
		James, President of Carol James Talent Agency; Ginny McCormac, the 
		Executive Director &amp; President of Goodwill Industries of Seattle; and 
		Sonya Kim, who was Associate Director of the Washington State Dept. of 
		Social Work.<br><br>Other initial women members were Assunta Ng, the 
		Publisher of the Seattle Chinese Post; Seattle City Councilmember 
		Dolores Sibonga; Barbara Vanderkolk, President of Barbara Vanderkolk &amp; 
		Associates, Inc.; Sister Charlotte Van Dyke, Director of Corporate 
		Relations of the Sisters of Providence; and Karilyn Van Soest, who was 
		President of Travel Bug, Inc., and who became President of the club on 
		July 1, 1988.<br><br></td>
