					to July 1, 2009</p>
					<p>Jim and Karen Kline get full credit for the founding of 
					WHRC. Karen's experience with Rotary International began 
					when she was chosen as a Rotary Scholar to Denmark in 
					1962-63. Later, she worked at Rotary International in 
					Evanston as Supervisor of R.I.'s Youth Exchange Program, 
					where she reported to Jim, then head of all international 
					and youth programs of R.I. and the Rotary Foundation. A 
					professional relationship turned into a personal one, and 
					they were married a year later. At different times, both 
					became members of the Rotary Club of Chicago; Karen was one 
					of the first women accepted into Rotary!</p>
					<p>Later, the Klines began their own business. They believed 
					there was room in the Village for a second Rotary Club, and 
					began researching the possibility. Initially, members of the 
					Noon Club, where Jim had transferred, had concerns that a 
					new club would take members away from their own, but they 
					gave Jim authorization to begin exploring the idea. When Jim 
					was elected Club President, he was able to move ahead. &quot;In 
					my 50 years of Rotary, I've never gotten more enjoyment out 
					of a project,&quot; says Jim, but for a year, my business 
					definitely suffered!&quot;</p>
					<p>Karen came up with our club's name. She looked to 
					Evanston Lighthouse R.C., which had used an Evanston 
					landmark in its name; thus, the Rotary Club of Wilmette 
					Harbor was chartered on May 22, 1990! The name came well 
					before a place for meetings was established, first at St. 
					John's Church, but later, at Sheridan Shore Yacht Club at 
					Wilmette Harbor!</p>
					<p>In the interest of brevity, the following WHRC history 
					does not annually cite continuing projects, nor every 
					project undertaken by the club each year. The club also won 
					numerous District awards throughout the years which have not 
					been listed in their entirety due to lost records. Finally, 
					the histories of club years vary in length due not to the 
					number of projects undertaken, but to the availability of 
					information at this time.</p>
					<p><strong>1990-91 - Karen Kline, Charter President</strong>
					<br>A black tie Charter Night was attended by Rotarians 
					throughout District 6440, as well as R.I. dignitaries. 
					Sixty-five Charter Members planted the charter oak tree in 
					Gillson Park. Membership was a mix of men and women: The 
					U.S. Supreme Court had decided in 1987 that women could not 
					be excluded from community groups in the U.S., and in 1989 
					the R.I. Council on <br>Legislation had voted to eliminate 
					the &quot;men only&quot; provision in Rotary clubs worldwide. 
					Technically, however, Rotary first admitted women in 1986, 
					after a lower court ruling. </p>
					<p><br>First service project: Collecting 12,000 eyeglasses 
					for an eye clinic in Thailand. The club entertained ten 
					short-term youth exchange students; the program, initiated 
					by Karen with the Rotary Club of Linz, Austria, continued 
					for years, with students from both countries exchanging 
					visits. WHRC also hosted four neighboring clubs, R.I. 
					President Luis Giay, and the R.I. Board of Directors as a 
					blue spruce was planted in Gillson Park for the first R.I. 
					Ecology Day. At the end of Karen's term as Club President, 
					an evergreen tree was planted at Gillson in her honor, 
					beginning a years-long tradition of honoring immediate past 
					club presidents with evergreens and plaques in the park. 
					WHRC began its sponsorship of a local Little League baseball 
					team. The club also sponsored a District fellowship event at 
					Ravinia which included a 5K race and performance by an 
					Evanston band. A coat drive for the needy was also 
					successful. Rotarian of the Year was Steve Breitberg.</p>
					<p>Notes on Karen Kline: Karen's abilities and achievements 
					were truly extraordinary. A complete list of her 
					accomplishments in Rotary alone would take several pages if 
					listed here. A few follow: Founding member, Rotary 
					Foundation Alumni Association ('89-'90), Governor's Group 
					Representative (Asst. Gov) ('91-'95), ABC's of Rotary Chair 
					('93-'94), Polio Plus Immunization Steering Committee member 
					('93-'94), member President's Advisory Council ('95), 
					District 6440 Governor ('96), Rotary Volunteer to Ghana and 
					Ethiopia ('97 NID), Eastern U.S. Area Coordinator, R.I. 
					Membership Task Force ('98). In that year she also was 
					awarded the Foundation's Citation for Meritorious Service. 
					She was the President's Representative to Copenhagen's 
					District Conference ('99). She was also named Regional 
					Coordinator of the Foundation Alumni Resource Group, then 
					General Coordinator (2000). Karen was awarded the 
					International Service Award for a Polio-free World in 2002. 
					She and husband Jim are Paul Harris Fellows, Benefactors, 
					and Major Donors to the Rotary Foundation. <br>&nbsp;<br>And a 
					personal note: There is a loving tendency, at times like 
					this, gently to enlarge the persona, talents, and 
					accomplishments of an individual being remembered. No one 
					need deify Karen. She simply doesn't need the help!<br>&nbsp;<br>
					Karen Oksendahl's abilities showed themselves early in her 
					life; she was graduated cum laude from St. Olaf College. In 
					'62 she was awarded a Rotary scholarship to Denmark, the 
					first Rotary Scholar sent to that country. She easily 
					mastered Danish and was so successful an ambassador for 
					Rotary-long before that term was added to the 
					scholarship-that R.I. requested she extend her stay in 
					Denmark, serving as an ambassador of good will.<br>&nbsp;<br>That 
					experience began her lifelong love affair with Rotary, its 
					ideals, and the Rotarians worldwide who turn those ideals 
					into concrete missions of love and service. Her knowledge 
					was encyclopedic, her memory prodigious, her enthusiasm 
					unbounded for all things Rotary. It was virtually impossible 
					to enter a conversation with her-about any topic-that didn't 
					end, somehow, discussing Rotary!<br>&nbsp;<br>Charter member Gil 
					Gilbert found it impossible to say No to Karen's 
					recruitment. &quot;One felt like you would be joining a very 
					prestigious organization, and she would do all the work. You 
					just had to attend meetings. We didn't know she already had 
					us penciled in for a committee!&quot;<br>&nbsp;<br>Club member Ted 
					Welch remembers Karen's personal friendships with Rotarians 
					around the world. We all know the concept of &quot;six degrees of 
					separation&quot; linking humankind: Ted says that, between Karen 
					and anyone on our globe, it had to be only a handshake!<br>&nbsp;<br>
					Rotarian Herb McDowell remembers her unashamedly special 
					passion for Rotary. &quot;Lots of us are dreamers,&quot; he says, &quot;but 
					Karen always managed to turn dreams into solid reality. With 
					her organizational and personal skills, she knew how to 
					implement the dream,&quot; whether a student exchange, a Matching 
					Grant, or a club project.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was always in awe of her 
					ability to meet people, ferret out their interests and 
					talents, and even years later, bring them to mind in order 
					to make a connection between them and a kindred spirit in 
					the Rotary family. Karen always saw the best in people; she 
					made each of us feel that we had a talent or ability that 
					could-and SHOULD-be used in Rotary. Over and over, we all 
					ruefully learned one didn't say No to her persuasive appeals 
					to help with this project or that. And after its completion, 
					she was always quick to proffer a sincere thank you-while 
					casually bringing up yet another project that would be 
					PERFECT for those selfsame skills and interests!<br>&nbsp;<br>
					Club member Nancy Hillner said that Karen always organized 
					and orchestrated everything so beautifully you never felt 
					you were in over your head. &quot;She always seemed to see how 
					something COULD be done, never feeling discouraged by 
					obstacles or difficulties. She gave us faith in our own 
					abilities. Karen was so certain we could succeed-that we 
					did!&quot;<br>&nbsp;<br>George Carpenter remembers Karen's brand of 
					leadership as a personal style that effectively motivated 
					individual achievements. &quot;She reached out to me saying she 
					KNEW I'd be good at working with Group Study Exchange. Of 
					course, I volunteered!&quot;<br>&nbsp;<br>I have never met anyone who 
					truly loved Rotary as deeply as Karen Kline, or who offered 
					as much of her talents and treasure to carry on its work in 
					our weary world. The outpouring of affection and respect for 
					Karen within our club honors her memory, which will ever 
					shine bright at the Rotary Club of Wilmette Harbor, where 
					Jim will always remain an honorary member. Personally, she 
					was unequaled as a purveyor of Rotary knowledge, 
					information, and lore, as a role model within Rotary, and as 
					a friend, whom I shall always dearly miss.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
