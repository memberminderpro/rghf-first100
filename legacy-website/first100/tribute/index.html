		Carter was the author of, &quot;The Romance of Rotary In London&quot; published in 
		1947. He had served as secretary of Rotary International in
		<a href="/first100/clubs/ireland-uk/">Great 
		Britain and Ireland</a> from 1921-1928 and then left for Chicago where 
		he became the the second editor of The Rotarian, following the 
		publication's founder and Rotary's first secretary Chesley R. Perry. 
		Carter was the editor until 1935. Carter writes that he had a great deal 
		of contact with Harris. Both as secretary of R.I.B.I and also as the 
		magazine's editor. Though many Rotarians, primarily in the UK, have 
		Carter's book on Rotary, it is a rare. We are fortunate to have Carter's 
		observations.<br><br>There has been much written about Paul Harris, the 
		founder of Rotary, but a careful reading of what Vivian Carter has to 
		say will give Rotarians a good measure of the man who, at the right 
		moment, was the inspiration for Rotary.<br><br>In addition to Carter's 
		insightful, firsthand recollections, there are links at the bottom of 
		this page leading to many other tributes and memorials to this modest 
		man from Wallingford.<br><br>Jack M. B. Selway, Founder<br>Rotary Global 
		History<br><br><a href="harris1920s.jpg">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="131" src="harris1920s.jpg" style="float: left" width="192"></a>In 
		Memory of Paul P. Harris, by Vivian Carter<br>From &quot;The Romance of 
		Rotary In London.&quot;<br><br>Almost on the very day on which the foregoing 
		pages were being passed to the printers came the news on the morning 
		radio bulletin that Paul Harris, Founder of Rotary, had passed away in 
		his 79th year.<br><br><a href="paul_jean_home.jpg">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="162" src="paul_jean_home.jpg" style="float: left" width="200"></a>Some 
		remarks additional to those very briefly made in Chapter I may not be 
		out of place from the author, who may claim to have enjoyed, during his 
		almost yearly visits to Chicago as Secretary of R.I.B.I., and his 
		residence there as Editor of The Rotarian, a very intimate relationship 
		with a personality around whom a certain mystery persists in clinging, 
		which, as the years go on, will inevitably shape into a myth.<br><br>
		<a href="harris_badge.jpg">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="212" src="harris_badge.jpg" style="float: left" width="200"></a>About 
		the man himself, I never met a celebrity less conscious of being one, or 
		less concerned to live up to the tradition woven around him. Paul, and 
		his charming, fresh&#8209;complexioned, smiling Scottish wife, lived at Morgan 
		Park, a wooded outskirt fourteen miles southwest of Chicago and far from 
		its madding crowds. Like the homes of so many other founders of great 
		movements, that of Paul and Mrs. Harris was of the simplest, most 
		tasteful and comfortable that could be desired. A fancy of his was to 
		sit in a dark corner and listen, and talk &#8209; when drawn out &#8209; slowly, 
		deliberately and reservedly on almost any topic raised. His philosophy &#8209; 
		strange as it may seem to those who associate Rotary with flamboyance 
		and exuberant optimism &#8209; was that of a skeptic, and I never succeeded in 
		extracting from him an exact statement of his religious faith.<br><br>He 
		gave no encouragement whatever to suggestions, freely made in the 
		twenties, on both sides of the Atlantic, that Rotary was a &quot;spiritual&quot; 
		movement in some way linked up with the churches. No man was fonder of a 
		joke, or fuller of amusing recollections, and his memories of Rotary 
		were memories of an infinite number of personal friends. If Chicago 
		still deserves its reputation for &quot;hustle,&quot; none of its citizens lived 
		up to it less than the founder of Rotary, whose movements, like his 
		speech, were slow, quiet, and unobtrusive.<br><br>
		<a href="founder_ded_silv.jpg">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="233" src="founder_ded_silv.jpg" style="float: left" width="200"></a>Though 
		one could place him more easily in an old&#8209;world English village than the 
		mid&#8209;western American metropolis, Paul Harris was immensely proud of 
		Chicago and its phenomenal growth during his long lifetime, and would 
		not stand for slighting remarks at its expense. The suggestion that 
		Rotary might move its home elsewhere was not one he favoured, and it has 
		not been carried out in his lifetime, anyway. Personally I hope it will 
		not be; for if Rotary is a good thing, why transplant it from its place 
		of origin?</td>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19" style="width: 50%">Of Paul Harris, 
		there is one outstanding thing to be said; he never forgot a friend, 
		never failed to respond to a request for help or advice. He put himself 
		to endless pains to help the visitor, especially if it had to do with 
		finding opportunities for service or a house-room in Chicago. He was 
		generous to a fault with letters of introduction, and wrote them in his 
		own handwriting.<br><br>As to the perennial question touched on the 
		first chapter of the book, the true origin of Rotary, and whether its 
		Founder ever foresaw its world&#8209;wide development, he admitted frankly 
		that it was primarily a fellowship that he conceived the original club.<br>
		<br>&quot;I was always a great lover of fun, he said, and got an ecstatic joy 
		out of contacts with others. But such things were spontaneous and not 
		part of my serious purpose with Rotary. My sense of the ethical 
		possibilities began to develop early in my experience of fellowship and 
		the fun of the thing, in which I reveled. I numbered among my intimate 
		friends <a href="/first100/leaders/sheldon/">
		Arthur Sheldon</a>, founder of the School of Business Science, one of 
		the earliest to propagate that Service must be the foundation of all 
		true success in business, and I was influenced by him to some extent. I 
		very soon began to realise that, in the Rotary organisation, we could 
		paint the picture that existed so far only in a sketch.&quot;<br><br>Nothing 
		can rob Paul Harris of the credit for the geographical extension of 
		Rotary, for he it was, beyond a doubt, who formed the clubs on the 
		Pacific Coast that were the first to follow Chicago. As is briefly 
		recorded in the book, it was in that more critical atmosphere that the 
		early crudities of the movement were rounded off, and its latent ethical 
		purposes gradually evolved that ultimately became paramount. As Harris 
		put it in the same conversation:<br><br>
		<a href="capetown.jpg">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="150" src="capetown.jpg" style="float: right" width="200"></a>&quot;When 
		it was made known to the world that Rotary was an ethical movement, the 
		true significance of the classification system was realised as it had 
		not been before. We had made a piece of machinery of which we had not 
		foreseen what would be the ultimate use. When we saw it, that the 
		classified man in Rotary should be the interpreter of the ideal of 
		service above self in business and profession, we sought to widen our 
		area in every direction, to get as many clubs as we could organise. When 
		the clubs began to be formed in other countries, then it was seen we had 
		yet a greater mission &#8209; as between nation and nation, people and people, 
		and so it is now developing.&quot;<br><br>
		<a href="paul1940s.jpg">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="279" src="paul1940s.jpg" style="float: right" width="200"></a>Of 
		late years Paul Harris had been somewhat of a shadowy figure in Rotary, 
		delivering regularly every year a &quot;<a href="/harris/library/speeches/">Message&quot; 
		to the Convention</a>, through a spokesman, and on occasion only 
		appearing in person. He visited Europe once or twice, and never enjoyed 
		anything more, I believe, than his quiet rambles in rural England, and 
		especially Dickens's England &#8209;and London. For one reason only am I 
		consoled that he passed away before paying our city a revisit, and that 
		is because it would surely have broken his heart to see the Temple and 
		some of the Inns in which he, as a lawyer, loved to wander and to 
		meditate, the heap of rubble they are today.<br><br>It is to be hoped 
		that the memory of this simple, lovable man, who &quot;showed himself 
		friendly&quot; to all with whom he came into contact, will be fittingly 
		honoured by the movement he founded that men the wide world over may 
		spread his ideals of fellowship and service among all the nations, and 
		that London will not fail to play her full part in that tribute.<br><br>
