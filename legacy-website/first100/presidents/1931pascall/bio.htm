	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">An eloquent speaker, Pascall’s 
		great passion was business ethics. Clearly inspired by Arthur Sheldon, 
		Pascall firmly believed in ethical codes for vocational service. Pascall 
		was a devout Christian and a scrupulous international businessman. As a 
		former RIBI President, Pascall was asked by the RI Board of Directors to 
		speak at the 1927 World Economic Conference called by the League of 
		Nations. The conference attempted to address some of the problems of the 
		increased trend away from free trade towards protectionism. Pascall 
		successfully argued for action to be taken against bribery in commerce 
		and industry.<br><br>Pascall also played a pivotal role in RIBI adopting 
		the infamous Resolution #3 in 1927. It stated:<br><br>“To provide for 
		the establishment of such forms of administration as will unite the 
		member clubs in the various areas for the purpose of advancing the Aims 
		and Objects of Rotary and securing the effective control and supervision 
		of such Clubs”.<br><br>This resolution, according to Pascall, sought to 
		devolve administrative power away from Chicago in order to allow the 
		upcoming mainland European areas to express themselves in their own way. 
		He said: “The scheme is an attempt for the first time to free the Board 
		of Rotary International from purely local affairs and administration.” 
		This resolution would, in effect, have ended the unique RIBI territorial 
		unit but because of objections and delay (after being initially endorsed 
		at Ostend) the idea was dead by 1937. Pascall described the problem of 
		the relationship between RIBI and the rest of the Rotary world as this 
		“interesting but sometimes rather trying problem!”<br><br>Sydney 
		Pascall’s greatest achievements include his work within RIBI – assisted 
		by RIBI Secretary Vivian Carter and William Moffat of Leeds Rotary Club 
		- in ‘rationalizing’ Rotary objectives under the so-called Aims and 
		Objects Plan. The basic six sentences of Rotary Aims and Objects seemed 
		too vague and bland according to Pascall. His Aims and Objects committee 
		broke down these broad principles in order for the individual club to 
		interpret through 4 avenues of service – Club Service, Community 
		Service, Vocational Service (and later) International Service. Each 
		individual Rotary Club would have four such committees.<br><br>It 
		simplified the club committee structure which had become either 
		non-existent or over-complex. This RIBI idea was fully endorsed by 
		Rotary International who complimented Pascall and his committee in their 
		work. Pascall, himself, explained what his committee were striving for.<br>
		<br>“This, therefore, led to the idea of a comprehensive Committee which 
		should be responsible for the whole of the Aims and Objects and the 
		propagation of their principles with sub-committees to be responsible 
		for the various main departments into which the Aims and Objects could 
		be logically divided, for example, Vocational Service (Business 
		Methods), Club Service (Fellowship, Acquaintance, etc) and Community 
		Service, so that, under the main Aims and Objects Committee, both 
		subjective and objective activities could be co-ordinated.” Rotary had 
		‘come of age’ according to the former editor of the RIBI publication 
		‘Rotary’. David Shelley Nicholl described this significant feat as being 
		“the operational framework upon which the deeds of Rotary have been 
		devised and performed, in many languages, in all climates, on club, 
		National and International scale ever since.”<br><br>Sydney Pascall 
		continued serving the movement after his Presidency ended by becoming 
		RIBI Treasurer and serving as Committee Chair in analysing the vexed 
		question of whether there could or should be expansion of Rotary Clubs 
		within the cities.<br><br>More significantly, Pascall chaired a meeting 
		of Ministers of Education in 1942 as part of a Rotary-inspired 
		conference to tackle the mammoth issue of the reconstruction and 
		rehabilitation of education in the post-war world. Many delegates were 
		Rotarians themselves and represented a host of countries including 
		Australia, Belgium, Canada, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Dominican 
		Republic, France, Greece, Guatemala, India, Panama, Poland, South 
		Africa, UK USA, USSR and Yugoslavia. And, thus, from the humble 
		beginnings of Sydney Pascall’s committee came into being the United 
		Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).<br>
		<br>Sydney Pascall was also a personal friend to Paul Harris and, like 
		the founder, visited Rotary the world over. But it was Pascall who 
		reached Australia first and who planted the first Friendship Trees down 
		under.</td>
