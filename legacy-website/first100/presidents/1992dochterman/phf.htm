		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/foundation/timeline/images/phf_certificate.gif" style="float: left">&quot;Recently, 
		I joined in a discussion about the importance of the dignity in the 
		presentation of a Paul Harris Fellow.<br><br>That is why The Rotary 
		Foundation has the beautiful medallion on a blue and gold ribbon, in 
		order that it can actually be presented around the neck of the 
		individual, along with the certificate and lapel pin to show that it is 
		an event of special significance.<br><br>When someone commented that the 
		presentation itself &quot;gives a PHF its true value as a recognition of 
		exceptional service,&quot; I felt that a little more explaining should be 
		made. Certainly, to recognize a person as a Paul Harris Fellow should 
		always be an honor to the individual, because it demonstrates 
		significant support for the wonderful work of The Rotary Foundation.. 
		But, just as a Paul Harris Fellow can be a &quot;recognition of exceptional 
		service,&quot; it can also be many other things, as well.<br><br>To describe 
		a PHF only in terms of &quot;exceptional service&quot; is far too limiting for the 
		entire Rotary world, and totally disregards the historical background of 
		the expression of appreciation for a very generous contribution to The 
		Rotary Foundation. If we did not think much broader in describing a Paul 
		Harris Fellow, and realize it is primarily a magnificent way to raise 
		money for The Foundation, I assure you that The Rotary Foundation would 
		not be one of the great humanitarian and educational foundations of the 
		world. What is the historical fact?<br><br>A few years ago, when I was a 
		Trustee of The Rotary Foundation, I went back and read all of the 
		minutes of the Trustees during the year l956-57. In the year l956, the 
		total contributions to The Rotary Foundation were a little less than 
		$500,000 US dollars ( $493,722 to be exact). The Trustees began to think 
		about how they could raise more money for the Foundation. What would be 
		a good way to encourage Rotarians to give &quot;big money&quot;?<br><br>The 
		Trustees finally came up with the idea of trying to get some Rotarians 
		to give $1000 in one major gift, by giving them a special form of public 
		recognition. So, it was suggested that we call them &quot;Paul Harris 
		Fellows.&quot;<br><br>There were three conditions: the contribution must be 
		at least $1000; it must be from one individual; and it must be given 
		within a single year. A very attractive pin and medallion were designed 
		as a means to identify this type of generous donor. As you recognize, in 
		l957, a monetary gift of $1000 was a very substantial amount of money. 
		So, there weren't too many gifts, and thus, very few Paul Harris 
		Fellows. As time went by, it was decided that The Foundation could 
		collect more money if the gift could be collected and given over several 
		years, and after there was a total accumulation of $1000, the Trustees 
		would designate the person as a Paul Harris Fellow.<br><br>Later, it was 
		suggested, that if a club did not have just one person who could give a 
		$1000 in a personal contribution, maybe several persons could go 
		together and make the $1000 gift. Then the question was raised, &quot;Who 
		will be the person who is named the Paul Harris Fellow?&quot; Gradually, the 
		answer was for the donors or the Rotary club to pick one person who had 
		long service, or some distinguishing characteristics, and name him or 
		her as the PHF. Thus, in some clubs, the concept developed that a Paul 
		Harris Fellow was just an award for exceptional service. The result was, 
		that in those clubs a Paul Harris Fellow took on a totally different 
		meaning (a reward for exceptional service) from its original purpose -- 
		to encourage individual Rotarians to give larger contributions to The 
		Rotary Foundation.<br><br>Ironically, in those clubs which chose to 
		limit the Paul Harris Fellow recognition to a form of an &quot;award for 
		exceptional service,&quot; many Rotarians were discouraged from making large 
		personal gifts to The Rotary Foundation since it might be interpreted as 
		giving merely seeking or buying an &quot;award.&quot; So, the per capita giving in 
		those areas of the world is much lower than those areas where the 
		concept of a Paul Harris Fellow is the original expression of 
		appreciation by The Rotary Foundation Trustees for an individual, or in 
		whose name, a gift of $1000 is given to conduct the work of The 
		Foundation. Has the Paul Harris Fellow recognition by the Trustees been 
		successful as a fund raising scheme? Absolutely! As I mentioned above, 
		in l956, less than $500,000 was raised annually by The Foundation.<br>
		<br>Today, nearly $70,000,000 is raised per year -- and about 80% of 
		those funds come from individuals being named Paul Harris Fellows, or 
		are naming other persons Paul Harris Fellows. The last time I checked, 
		there were about 700,000 Paul Harris Fellows, and multi-Fellows in the 
		world. They are the backbone of the annual support to The Rotary 
		Foundation, and those donations are the only reason that enables 
		Rotarians to carry on a world-wide program of educational and 
		humanitarian programs.<br><br>So, what is a Paul Harris Fellow? Think 
		for a moment of this statement: &quot;A Paul Harris Fellow means whatever you 
		want it to mean.&quot; Should The Rotary Foundation accept a $1000 
		contribution as a way to honor a person for exceptional service? 
		Certainly.<br><br>Should The Rotary Foundation accept a gift of $1000 as 
		an expression of happiness for 20 years of marriage, or a new 
		grandchild, or success in one's vocation or family life? Of course.<br>
		<br>Should The Rotary Foundation accept a $1000 contribution in memory 
		of a friend, relative or associate who has been an important asset to 
		your life? Certainly.<br><br>Should The Rotary Foundation accept $1000 
		if you really believe in the tremendous value of the humanitarian work 
		of TRF in developing parts of the world and thereby express appreciation 
		for your gift by naming you a Paul Harris Fellow or multi-PHF? 
		Absolutely.<br><br>So, I suggest that a Paul Harris Fellow can mean 
		whatever you wish it to mean. The Rotary Foundation benefits from your 
		contribution and demonstrates this appreciation through the mechanism of 
		a Paul Harris Fellow. That is the way I see it.&quot;</td>
