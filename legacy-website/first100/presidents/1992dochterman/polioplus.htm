		The program to eradicate polio, called Polio Plus, has been Rotary

		<img class="auto-style25" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/rip-images/92-93dochterman.jpg" style="float: left"></a>Rotary's 
		Polio Plus program has been described as the finest humanitarian project 
		by a non-governmental organization the world has ever known. Rotary has 
		been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for our efforts. It is Rotary's 
		project of the highest interest for over 20 years. <br><br>Many 
		Rotarians have no idea of how Rotary ever became involved in eradicating 
		polio in the world. So, let me recall the story. <br><br>In the 1950s, 
		60s, and 70s, virtually every person knew someone in their family or 
		circle of friends who had polio. In the early 1950s, there were annually 
		over 55,000 cases of polio in the United States. Worldwide there were 
		perhaps 500,000 cases of polio. Of that number 50,000 children a year 
		would die from polio and thousands more would be crippled, paralyzed or 
		suffer lifelong disabilities. <br><br>So that was the backdrop of our 
		story. In 1978, Rotary had a committee, appointed by R.I. President Clem 
		Renouf, to design a new direction for Rotary. It was called the Health, 
		Hunger and Humanity Committee. This was a small committee to design a 
		program for Rotary International to undertake projects far greater than 
		any club or district could do. Rotary had never undertaken a corporate 
		or worldwide project – just club programs. I happened to be co-chairman 
		of that 3-H Committee. We knew that if we didn't have an immediate 
		success, the Rotary world would probably scrap the program the next 
		year. So we looked for an “immediate success” project. We had about 16 
		projects proposed from around the world. One proposal was from the 
		Philippines. Dr. Benny Santos wrote that if Rotary could provide the 
		vaccine, they would mobilize all the Rotarians in the entire Philippines 
		and immunize all the children. So, that was it. We approved the project; 
		and if I recall correctly, some 6 million children were immunized 
		against polio. It was a huge success. Pharmaceutical companies had other 
		types of vaccine – for measles, tetanus, chicken pox and other vaccines 
		which were donated for Rotarians to distribute in several areas of the 
		world. Rotary proved that immunization was the kind of project Rotary 
		volunteers could handle. <br><br>A couple years passed, and another 
		Rotary committee was created in 1982 by R.I. President Stan McCaffrey 
		called the New Horizons Committee. This group had the job of “looking 
		into the future of Rotary to see what tasks or new directions Rotary 
		could take on the future.” I happened to be chairman of this committee. 
		We considered hundreds of ideas – some big ones and some rather 
		frivolous. Finally, I suggested that we ought to be thinking 20 or 30 
		years into the future. Why not do something big for Rotary's 100th 
		anniversary coming up in 2005? A letter from Rotarian John Sever 
		suggested that we might provide polio vaccine for all the children in 
		the world. The committee thought that was a good idea, so it was one of 
		the 35 suggestions to the R.I. Board of Directors. So, in l982 the Board 
		of Rotary International approved the idea of giving polio vaccine to all 
		the children in the world. The project was called “Polio 2005.” <br><br>
		Two or three years went by, and finally in 1985, Dr. Carlos Canseco, RI 
		Pres. from Monterrey, Mexico said that if we were going to get the task 
		done by 2005, we should get started. So, he called Dr. Albert Sabin to 
		Evanston and we had a meeting of some of the world's most distinguished 
		medical and public health leaders. Dr. Sabin said it would cost at least 
		$100 million dollars and we would have to immunize 500 million children. 
		Wow what a job! <br><br>So, Rotary set a goal of $ 120,000 to raise the 
		funds, and the name of the project was changed to “Polio Plus.” It was 
		the first major fund raising campaign by Rotarians of the world for a 
		single project. However, by 1987 we had surpassed the goal and actually 
		raised $240 million. So, Rotary leaders went to the World Health 
		Organization and said we want to eradicate polio. It was not well 
		accepted by all the WHO leaders who represented some of the most 
		knowledgeable health authorities in the world. Rotary was “just a 
		service club.” Finally, when Rotary told them that we had over a million 
		volunteers and $247 million in our pocket, they said, “Come on in.” So 
		we became full partners of the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and 
		the US Centers for Disease Control. <br><br>At that time, in 1988, you 
		could find polio in 125 nations of the world and it was estimated that 
		there were 350,000 cases of polio in the world every year. But we took 
		on the project – one country at a time. Our first big immunization day 
		was in Mexico, where we immunized 13 million children. Then we went to 
		Central America and South America. One nation after another became 
		“polio free.” <br><br>Rotary Clubs became “Polio Plus Partners” to raise 
		funds for National Immunization Days. The Partners purchased ice boxes, 
		colorful vests, caps, leaflets, street banners and many other items 
		needed to mobilize whole nations to immunize their children. <br><br>
		Mary Elena and I were in India to participate in the national day of 
		immunization. There were banners on the streets, parades, notices, 
		distribution of thousands of radio and television announcements, plus 
		hand bills and leaflets. In that one day over 125 million children 
		received the two drops of polio vaccine. We have gone to some of the 
		most poverty stricken areas of the Philippines, Ethiopia, Turkey and 
		other nations to assist in National Immunization Days. <br><br>The 
		project is an amazing and complicated one. Rotarians and health workers 
		have to go to the most remote areas of the world by canoe, camels, 
		elephants, horseback, motorbikes, and every other conceivable vehicle to 
		reach all the world's children. <br><br>I remember sitting on a rock on 
		the side of a dusty road in Argentina giving vaccine to children in a 
		remote area. Dozens of volunteer Rotarians, youth exchange students, 
		health workers, youth organizations and other would go door to door 
		urging parents to bring their children to get the vaccine. <br><br>Even 
		in China, Laos, Vietnam, Cuba, Myanmar and other areas where there is no 
		Rotary, we worked freely to distribute the vaccine. An interesting 
		experience occurred in China. There was reluctance by China officials to 
		accept vaccine from the Western Nations. We said, use Chinese made 
		vaccine. But there was no polio vaccine made in China. So, Rotary said, 
		“We will build a pharmaceutical plant in China, and made a grant of $18 
		million dollars to construct a factory in China. As soon as the project 
		was under way, China said now we will take the vaccine from the West. 
		Immediately, China said all the children of China will be immunized, and 
		the first two days, 100 million Chinese youngsters received the polio 
		vaccine. <br><br>The amazing thing is that the pharmaceutical plant has 
		never produced one dose of polio vaccine, and the Chinese officials went 
		ahead and immunized their children when they saw that Rotary 
		International was serious about this mission. <br><br>We were not able 
		to meet the target of a polio-free world by 2005, but we are close. Over 
		99% of the children of the world have received polio vaccine. You can 
		find polio only in 4 nations, not the 125 countries when we started. We 
		hope that we can soon stop the incidents in Nigeria, India, Pakistan 
		andAfghanistan. Last year there were only about a thousand cases in the 
		world – compared to the 350,000 cases a year when Rotary undertook this 
		humanitarian mission. <br><br>There are so many aspects to the polio 
		story. I recall one day, when I was Chairman of The Rotary Foundation. 
		We had a call from the World Health Organization, saying that they had 
		arranged for a four day cease fire in the civil war in the Sudan so we 
		could go in and immunize their children. But the WHO did not have any 
		money to purchase the vaccine. I said, “How much does it take?” It was 
		going to cost $400,000. I said, “You can have it immediately from The 
		Rotary Foundation.” The Chairman can make a grant up to $500,000 for an 
		emergency humanitarian effort. The war stopped, health workers went in 
		and immunized 3 or 4 million children – then the war started again. The 
		World Health Organization said, “Of all the places in the world, there 
		was no place we could turn – except Rotary, to make that project 
		happen.” Clearly, without the efforts of Rotary the achievements to 
		eradicate polio would never have happened. <br><br>Perhaps some of you 
		have participated in a National Immunization Day. It is an amazing 
		experience. I remember when Mary Elena and I sloshed through the mud 
		streets of a poverty stricken village in Ethiopia – one of the poorest 
		nations of the world. The homes were nothing but shacks, dirt floors, 
		which turned into mud with the occasional showers. Families cooked on 
		wood fires outside their huts. This was the first polio immunization in 
		this poor nation. In those few days, nearly 10 million children were 
		given the drops of polio vaccine. <br><br>But of all the experiences of 
		that day, I recall the ceremony to start the immunization. The President 
		of Ethiopia was on hand. There were about a hundred little children 
		lined up to receive the vaccine from their national president. And just 
		at that time, on the other side of the room were about 35 small 
		children, perhaps 5 to 10 years of age, all in wheelchairs, or leg 
		braces, or crutches -- they were all polio victims with bent backs and 
		withered arms and twisted legs. They stood up the best they could and 
		sang a song to the President. The song said: “It's too late for us – but 
		don't let other children get polio. Do what you can to Kick Polio Out of 
		Africa.” <br><br>If you had been there to hear that song, “It's too late 
		for us, but don't let other children get polio,” you would know why 
		Rotary has taken on this monumental task. <br><br>If we had only had the 
		vaccine 2, 5, 10 years before in Ethiopia these children would be 
		walking, running and playing as children want to do. There are over 2 
		billion children who have received Rotary's polio vaccine – and they are 
		now living a life without the fear of paralysis and death from polio.
		<br><br>We are on the verge of eradicating this dreaded disease. Perhaps 
		next year, or the year after. And the amazing thing is it has been made 
		possible because Rotary Clubs, like yours, took a huge step some 20 
		years ago. Even today, funding is necessary. You may have heard that the 
		Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has contributed $350 million dollars 
		to our efforts in recent months because they believe that Rotary will 
		achieve this dream. <br><br>That's the story of Rotary's involvement in 
		our greatest humanitarian program – Polio Plus. And I thank every one of 
		you who have been a part of this program for so many years.<br><br>The 
		leaders of the world have clearly expressed that without Rotary 
		International, this monumental achievement would never be accomplished. 
		We will eradicate polio in the world – and it will happen only because 
		Rotary made a commitment some 25 years ago. And the world has learned 
		that Rotarians keep their promises. <br><br>(Excerpt from As I Was 
		Saying by RGHF member <br>Cliff Dochterman, President, Rotary
