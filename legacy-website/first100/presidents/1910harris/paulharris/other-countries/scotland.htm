		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">Some thoughts on Paul Harris<br>
		-the Architect of Rotary<br>&quot;Then let us pray that come it may, <br>(As 
		come it will for a' that,) <br>That Sense and Worth, o'er a' the earth,
		<br>Shall bear the gree, an' a' that,<br>For a' that, an' a' that, <br>
		It's coming yet for a' that,<br>That man to man, the world o'er,<br>
		Shall brithers be for a' that.&quot;<br><br>Robert Burns<br><br>Paul Percy 
		Harris was the founder of Rotary, the world's first truely international 
		service club. Harris created something unique, a whole world away from 
		the old fraternity clubs such as the Elks and the Masonic Orders. Paul 
		Harris founded a different type of organisation, based on informality 
		and exclusitivity that the fraternalist clubs could never attain. In his 
		own words, Rotary offered &quot; fraternity without rituals, passwords and 
		secrets&quot;. Harris' idea of the service club has been copied and adapted 
		the world over from the Lions and Kiwanis to the British Round Table.<br>
		<br>Paul Harris was born in Racine Wisconsin, USA on 19 April 1868. 
		Significantly, at three years old, Paul moved to Wallingford, Vermont 
		where he grew up in the care of his paternal grandparents. His 
		upbringing in the small New England town of the late nineteenth century 
		would shape his destiny in years to come. There is much speculation 
		about Harris' roots - he claimed he was descended from the pilgrim 
		fathers and certainly had Irish ancestors on his mothers side but his 
		surname suggests that he has Scottish ancestry as hinted to by Rotarian 
		James T Walsh in his excellent book, The First Rotarian. Former RIBI 
		Editor Vivian Carter accepts this in his book, The Romance of Rotary in 
		London (p. 16).<br><br>Rotarian David Shelley Nicholl in his Rotary 
		Global History, The Golden Wheel seems to accept Harris' Scottish roots 
		by looking at circumstantial evidence. Nicholl goes on to say (at page 
		17), &quot;Paul Harris was bequeathed by inheritance...the thoughtful, 
		hard-working Scottish prudence which knew its place and stayed there&quot;.<br>
		<br>Paul Harris<br><br>PAUL P. HARRIS<br>1868-1947<br><br>Paul went on 
		to marry a young Scottish lady on July 2nd 1910. Jean Thomson Harris 
		(1881 - 1963) was born and brought up in Edinburgh. The couple had no 
		children, however, Paul Harris always felt that Rotary International was 
		his adoptive child and many visitors took up Paul's kind invitation to 
		share his home &quot;Comely Bank&quot; [10856 Longwood Drive] - named after the 
		street in Edinburgh, Scotland where Jean spent her childhood. <br>Paul 
		and Jean Harris<br><br>

		Edinburgh's Comely Bank as it is in February 2002<br><br>He received his 
		L.L.B. (Bachelor of Laws) from the University of Iowa. Paul had also 
		spent a year of study at Princeton College, New Jersey under the 
		guidance of President Dr James McCosh, formerly of the University of 
		Edinburgh who taught logic and psychology. Many years later he received 
		an honorary L.L.D. (Doctor of Laws) from the University of Vermont where 
		he had been expelled (mistakenly) from in his youth. Paul Harris was, in 
		addition, given the Degree of Doctor honoris causa from the College of 
		Law in Lima, Peru.<br><br>After University, Paul Harris decided to take 
		five years out to see the world and worked in a variety of short-term 
		jobs. These included a newspaper reporter in San Francisco, a business 
		teacher in Los Angeles, stock company actor in Denver and a cowboy in 
		the Rockies. He travelled extensively all over the USA and on to Britain 
		and mainland Europe. Paul was a great admirer of British writers such as 
		Sir Walter Scott, Charles Dickens and Shakepeare. That great Scotsman 
		Robert Burns was his favourite poet. Harris was truly, even at this 
		early age, a great internationalist.<br><br>After his five years of 
		travel and adventures he arrived in Chicago to practice law in 1896. One 
		evening in the summer of 1900, Paul visited the suburban home of a 
		professional friend. Initially, Harris -like so many other country boys 
		in the big city-had struggled to make friends. After dinner, as they 
		strolled through his neighbourhood, Paul's friend introduced him to 
		various tradesmen in their stores, - referring to each person by their 
		first name. It was here Paul conceived the idea of a club that could 
		recapture some of the friendly spirit among businessmen in that small, 
		rural New England communiy he knew and loved. Paul Harris did not act 
		immediately, this dream of community spirit would take a few years yet 
		to incubate before its birth.<br><br>As Harris himself, in My Road to 
		Rotary, said, &quot; The thought persisted that I was experiencing only what 
		had happened to hundreds, perhaps thousands, of others in the great city 
		came to me. I was sure that there must be many other young men who had 
		come from farms and small villages to establish themselves in Chicago. 
		In fact, I knew a few. Why not bring them together? If the others were 
		longing for fellowship as I was, something would come of it.&quot;<br><br>
		This Rotarian Age<br><br>On 23 February, 1905, Paul Harris formed the 
		first club with three other businessmen: Silvester Schiele, a coal 
		merchant; Gustavus Loehr, a mining engineer; and Hiram Shorey, a 
		merchant tailor. Loehr and Shorey 'failed to follow through' but new 
		members emerged like the printer, Harry Ruggles and Charley Newton. 
		Schiele, a life-long personal friend, became the first President of the 
		club. Paul Harris named the new club &quot;Rotary&quot; because members met in 
		rotation at their various places of business. Club membership grew 
		rapidly due to the ideas of fellowship and extending business interests. 
		Very soon Paul became convinced that the Rotary club could be developed 
		into a more important national and international service movement and he 
		unilaterally strove to extend Rotary to other cities. in that first 
		Chicago Club had their doubts about this &quot;Rotary Around the World 
		phantasy&quot; but Paul's determination and single-mindedness won the day. 
		Paul's notion of community service is what allowed Rotary to expand and 
		become the world wide phenomenon it is today and is Harris' greatest 
		achievement.<br><br>Rotary was born in this new era of Progressivism 
		where new responsibilities towards social justice began to emerge. 
		Best-selling books such as Upton Sinclair's The Jungle (1906) - set in 
		&quot;virile, agressive, pradoxical Chicago&quot; - forced new attitudes about 
		service to one's community. As Harris said, &quot;The ills with which Chicago 
		was afflicted in those days were also prevalent elsewhere in the 
		country...Community spirit was at a low ebb almost everywhere. It was 
		time for a change for the better. It had to come&quot;. The first community 
		service project undertaken by the first Rotary Club was the 
		establishment of 'public comfort stations' (toilets!).<br><br>The 
		Houston Chronicle in 1919 said that &quot;He (Harris) organised a strange 
		kind of club, for which men get nothing, but actually pay for the 
		privilege of doing good&quot;. Of course Rotarians do not get nothing out of 
		their club, they are inundated with a bounty of friendship and 
		fellowship as well as the wonderful satisfaction in making a difference 
		to their communities and the world.<br><br>Paul was prominent in other 
		civic and professional work. He served as the first chairman of the 
		board of the national Easter Seal Society of Crippled Children and 
		Adults in the USA and of the International Society for Crippled 
		Children. He was a member of the board of managers of the Chicago Bar 
		Association and its representative at the International Congress of Law 
		at the Hague, and a committee member of the American Bar Association. He 
		received the Silver Buffalo Award from the Boy Scouts of America for 
		distinguished service to youth, and was decorated by the governments of 
		Brazil, -The Order of the Southern Cross,Chile - Order of Merit, 
		Dominican Republic- Order of Cristobal Colon, Ecuador- Order of Merit, 
		France- Officer Legion of Honour and Peru, Order of the Sun.<br><br>
		Rotary honoured Paul Harris on his retirement in 1912 after a physical 
		breakdown with the unique title of President Emeritus, the only person 
		to hold such a distinction. Harris was a somewhat frail figure 
		physically but blessed with a huge heart and concrete principles. This 
		modest man would probably blush if he could sense just a fraction of the 
		affection to which he is still held by Rotarians the world over.<br><br>
		Paul spent his latter years from 1926 onwards travelling and was invited 
		to speak to Rotarians at annual conventions, district and regional 
		meetings, and other functions. He became Rotary's greatest ambassador 
		always sending a profound message to RI Conventions. Many Rotarians 
		believed Harris was dead. One of his most significant, symbolic gestures 
		was the planting of Friendship Trees in many of the countries ravaged by 
		War.<br><br>Harris died on January 27th, 1947, two days after that other 
		Chicago personage, Al Capone. His vision, however, lives on in all 
		Rotarians whether they realise it or not. From the fellowship of the 
		weekly meeting to the varied charity and community events, his hopes and 
		aspirations continue and surely as Paul himself would say, there is even 
		more for Rotary to achieve in the future. The concept of service has 
		been established and recognised and when faced with the challenges of 
		depression or war it grows even stronger. In 1947 his dream had grown 
		from an informal meeting of four men to some 6,000 clubs brought 
		together through the service and fellowship of Rotary. In the following 
		five decades, the organisation has grown to more than 30,000 clubs with 
		1.2 million members bound together through Paul Harris' vision of 
		service and fellowship. Paul Harris' death saw the beginning of the 
		Rotary Foundation as a mark of tribute to the man, the Foundation is the 
		largest private charity foundation in the world with a very simple aim, 
		- to do good.<br><br>Paul Harris in Edinburgh<br>
		<img alt="Paul  Harris in Edinburgh" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1910harris/paulharris/other-countries/images/ph-edin.jpg"><br>
		Paul Harris on one of his many international visits - Edinburgh in 1934.
		<br><br>Paul Harris is not dead. So said Thomas A Warren from 
		Wolverhampton, England, Immediate Past President of Rotary International 
		in The Rotarian, March 1947. In his tribute, President Warren said, &quot;His 
		spirit lives on. It abides everywhere. It is woven into the very fibre 
		of other men's lives. As we take leave of his mortal self, we 
		re-dedicate ourselves to the never ending task he has inspired and 
		bequeathed to those who will assuredly follow his paths down the years 
		to come.&quot;<br>Our Club and this web site tries to live up to this maxim, 
		- &quot;In the promotion of international understanding and goodwill, one 
		must remember it's important to reach as large numbers as possible - 
		non-Rotarians as well as Rotarians- and one cannot reach large numbers 
		privately.&quot; PAUL HARRIS, &quot;Peregrinations&quot; Vol II,<br><br>The thoughts 
		and historical interpretations on this page belong to the webmaster,
