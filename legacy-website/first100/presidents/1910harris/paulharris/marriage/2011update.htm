		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19"  width: 50%>As always in the RGHF,

		PAUL HARRIS MARRIES</a>, we wondered what was their connection with 416 
		W 60th.<br><br>The use of 416 W 60th for the marriage of Paul Harris and 
		Jean Thomson may have been solved by an entry in the Genealogy of Jean 
		Thomson provided by PDG Ian Campbell, coupled with another photo by Neil 
		Dahlmann.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style25" height="492" src="clip_image001.jpg" style="float: left" width="445">This 
		house clearly has two numbers 414 and 416. Ian Campbell in his genealogy 
		of Jean Thomson wrote:<br><br>&quot;Jean's older brother John Youngson 
		Thomson (b.1874) travelled to the United States with his wife Annie 
		(born Anne) and his daughter Joanna (aka Joey) on the Anchor Line ship 
		SS California sailing to New York, USA from Glasgow, Scotland on 28th 
		May 1910, with an ultimate destination of seeing his son Alexander at 
		414 West 60th Street, Chicago, Illinois, USA, presumably to attend the 
		marriage of his daughter Jean (aka Jane) to Paul Harris on 2nd July 
		1910.&quot;<br><br>John and Annie remained in Chicago for some years before 
		returning to Scotland. The 1910 US Census shows 5 members of the family 
		at 414 W 60th, Jean's brothers and sister. They were:<br>John Youngson 
		Thomson, then aged 33, Alexander Thomson 30, Jean Thomson 27, James Hay 
		Thomson 25, Mary Thomson 23.<br><br>Somewhere in the same area, but 
		exactly where we are not sure, were Jean's parents John and Anne Thomson 
		and Jean's sister Joanna 19. The three of them had travelled out to 
		North America in 1910. Only Jean's oldest sister Anne Ferguson Thomson 
		is missing. She had accompanied brother James to North America in 1906. 
		Later, in 1930, John and his wife Anne were shown in the census as 
		living with their unmarried children James and Mary in the same part of 
		Chicago.<br><br>It seems fairly certain that, Anne Ferguson Thomson 
		apart, and she may have been present, the entire family had gathered 
		together for Jean's wedding to Paul Harris, which took place in the same 
		building, <br>414/416 W 60th where several of them were staying.<br><br>
		Joanna returned to Scotland and married the Rev. John Howe who had 
		studied at McCormick Theological Seminary, Chicago, USA, from 1910 to 
		1913. He was Licensed by The Presbytery of Chicago on 21st April 1913 
		and was Ordained as a Minister of the Presbyterian Church of America on 
		30th April 1913. The Rev Paul McClanahan who performed the wedding, was 
		the minister of a local Presbyterian Church so may well have been a 
		friend of John Howe. Howe was admitted as Minister of Elder Memorial 
		Presbyterian Church, Leith, Scotland,on 19th February 1914. He then 
		transferred to Greenock (South) Church, Scotland on 22nd June 1920 and 
		then to Annbank Old Church, Tarbolton, Ayrshire on 3rd May 1931. He 
		acted as Chaplain to the Lord High Commissioner at the General Assembly 
		of the Church of Scotland held in Edinburgh in May 1931. The Lord High 
		Commissioner was the former well known Member of Parliament, James 
		Brown, who was born and lived in Tarbolton, Ayrshire, where John 
		Youngson Thomson had his Ministry at Annbank Parish Church. On his visit 
		to Scotland in 1934, Paul Harris (who was the brother in law of John 
		Youngson Thomson) whilst visiting John took dinner with that very 
		unusual character, Honourable James Brown, M.P. Paul was very impressed 
		with Mr Brown and appears to have been presented with a photograph of 
		Their Graces House Party and Suite taken at the General Assembly of the 
		Church of Scotland in 1931, the photograph being still displayed at 
		Rotary International Headquarters in Evanston, Chicago, USA. It can be 
		seen in our pages on the Paul Harris Gallery.<br><br>RGHF Senior 
		Historian Basil Lewis, England, 27 August 2011, posted by Jack Selway<br>
		<br><a name="Updatedecember">Update December 2011:</a><br>In the first 
		decade of the 20th century, Paul Harris was, by his own admission, 
		something of a nomad in Chicago. (1) In the Chicago Directories for the 
		period, he appears to have been in various small hotels or boarding 
		houses.<br>In 1900 he was at 519 LaSalle Ave and in 1901 in Oak Park. 
		From 1902 to 1904, he was in Evanston but in 1905 he is shown as being 
		at 291 Ashland Blvd. In 1906 he was at the New South Hotel and the 
		following year at the Hyde Park Hotel. In 1908 he had moved to the Hotel 
		Windermere and in 1909 to Hinsdale. The hotels were mostly in the Hyde 
		Park area. According to the 1910 US Census on May 5, 1910, he was living 
		at 1258 Michigan Ave but the 1910 Chicago city directory indicates he 
		had a residence in Hinsdale. (2) Two months after the Census, on July 
		2nd, 1910, Paul and Jean were married. <br>We do not know where in 
		Hinsdale, Paul was living. Jean, however, was living at 414 W 60th 
		Street where her brothers, John, James and Alexander were also lodging, 
		as well as her sister Mary. The rest of Jeans family were also somewhere 
		in Chicago at this time. These were her parents, John and Anne (nee 
		Youngson), sister Joanna, and another sister, Ann, who was living in 
		Canada. Curiously, the marriage licence shows that the wedding took 
		place at 416 W 60th and this appears to be the same building as 414. <br>
		<br>After his marriage to Jean Thomson in 1910, it seems that Paul and 
		Jean were living at 3605 Pine Grove Ave on the North side of Chicago. 
		There they lived until they were able to secure the property at 10810 
		Longwood Drive (Comely Bank).(2) There they were to spend the rest of 
		their lives. The Plat book records that the Harrises entered into 
		transactions with a Mr and Mrs Dickey for the property at Longwood Drive 
		on October 23, 1911.(3)<br><br>Meanwhile, John and Ann, Jeans parents, 
		were still in Chicago in 1920, living with Alexander, James, Mary and 
		Joanna somewhere in the 103rd Precinct in Chicago.<br>Although as yet. 
		we have not established the actual address, it may well have been <br>
		10501 South Hamilton. In 1921 Alexander, and in 1922 James became 
		naturalised American citizens using this address as their home base 
		although on April 27th, 1921, Alexander had married Jennie Harper. <br>
		<br>1- The Founder of Rotary: While he loved to study life in general, 
		he was particularly anxious to know the ins and outs of his own city. To 
		facilitate his studies of different localities he made frequent changes 
		of residence, a practical solution of the problem so long as he remained 
		unmarried but fin- practicable thereafter. During his fifteen years of 
		bachelor life he resided in thirty different parts of Chicago and 
		neighboring suburbs. Up to the very day of his marriage he was setting 
		new records for change of domicile. Paul claims the long-distance 
		champion ship in this regard, in fact, he sampled every thing from Hells 
		Half Kitchen up. Business considerations prevented his adopting a 
		migratory plan of office occupancy. There was always one address at 
		which he could be found.<br><br>2- This information was provided by PDG 
		Fred Carvin.<br><br>3- This information was provided by PDG Fred Otto<br>
