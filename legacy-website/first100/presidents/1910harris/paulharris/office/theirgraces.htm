      <p align="center"><b>RESEARCHING A PHOTOGRAPH</b></p>
		<font SIZE="2">
		<p>When we were examining a picture in the Paul Harris Gallery in 
		Evanston, we could not understand why it was there. We knew that Paul 
		Harris was not in Scotland in 1931 and we could only imagine that he was 
		in some way connected with someone in the photograph. The most likely 
		candidate was Jean Harris' brother who was a clergyman, but it still 
		begged the question, what was the occasion and was Rev John Youngson 
		Thomson there?</p>
		<p>At this point we had contact with PDG Ian Campbell, a keen and 
		knowledgeable Scottish historian. It was possible to decipher the names 
		of those in the picture and Ian was then able to make a reasoned guess 
		as to the occasion. Rev Thomson was indeed there, 4th from the right in 
		the back row.</p>
		<p>By looking through various documents relating to the Church in 
		Scotland and to Scottish newspapers, Ian Campbell was able to identify 
		almost all the people shown.</p>

		Marquis of Douglas &amp; Clydesdale, who is the eldest son of the Duke of 
		Hamilton. The Title of 13th Duke of Hamilton and 10th Duke of Brandon 
		passed to Alfred Douglas Douglas-Hamilton (1862-1940) in 1895. He was 
		also the 9th Earl of Selkirk, a title succeeded to in 1940 by Lord)

		<p>While this explained who everyone was, there was also the question of 
		what was the occasion. To find this Ian turned to the records of the 
		Church of Scotland and particularly, those relating to the General 
		Assembly in 1931.</p>
		<p>Because of the range of people in the picture, it was almost 
		certainly taken in connection with the Assembly. The General Assembly is 
		basically the Annual General Meeting, of the Church of Scotland and is 
		held (usually in Edinburgh) for a week in the month of May of each year. 
		The Sessions are usually held in the Mound in the heart of Edinburgh. 
		The Chairman is the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of 
		Scotland.</p>
		<p>The Sovereign attends the General Assembly but, in his/her absence, 
		is represented by her Lord High Commissioner, whose duties are very 
		largely formal and ceremonial. For example, The Lord High Commissioner 
		in the Assembly of 2007 was His Royal Highness The Duke of York. On 
		behalf of the Sovereign, the Lord High Commissioner makes opening and 
		closing speeches to the Assembly and carries out a number of official 
		visits and ceremonial functions, not all of which are related to the 
		Church of Scotland. Whilst the General Assembly is meeting, the Lord 
		High Commissioner is treated as if a Regent. By custom he or she is 
		addressed as 'Your Grace' and is greeted with a bow or a curtsey. This 
		explains why James Brown is described as 'His Grace James Brown'. Since 
		1834, the Lord High Commissioner has resided at the Palace of 
		Holyroodhouse, the Sovereign's official residence in Scotland in 
		Edinburgh, during the period of the General Assembly. He normally gives 
		a Garden Party, in the grounds of Holyroodhouse, for the Commissioners 
		to the General Assembly on the Saturday afternoon of Assembly week, and 
		also provides other hospitality such as levees, dinner parties and 
		attendance at certain ceremonies.</p>
		<p>The Lord High Commissioner carries out his duties assisted by his 
		House Party and Suite (Retinue). The term 'House Party and Suite' as 
		referred to in the caption to the photograph, is used in that context 
		and not to mean a specific event. The Suite is along the lines of the 
		Household retinue used by Her Majesty.</p>
		<p>The main ceremonial events were 'The First Levee' , the Procession to 
		St Giles Cathedral and The Opening Ceremony which were all held on May 
		19, 1931. A reception and a garden party were held on May 22 and 23, 
		1931. 'The Scotsman' published a list of 'Their Graces Suite' and a List 
		of those guests who were staying in the Palace with daily variations 
		therein and various articles mentioned specific people who were present. 
		This information confirmed the names and details above. Furthermore, 
		using the list of names, it is almost certain that this photograph was 
		taken at the time of the Opening Ceremony on May 19</p>
		<p>Records consulted included:</p>
		<p>The Official Records of Births, Marriages, Deaths and Census Returns 
		held in the General Records Office in Edinburgh.</p>
		<p>The Fasti Ecclesiae Scoticanae (that records the succession of 
		Ministers in the Church of Scotland from the Reformation) to trace the 
		career of the Rev John Youngson Thomson's career.</p>
		<p>The Scots Peerage to check the lineage of the nobles who are shown in 
		the photograph.</p>
		<p>The Digital Archives of the Scotsman Newspaper (based in Edinburgh) 
		to check proceedings at the General Assembly for 1931.</p>
		<p>This very full account of what had been labelled a 'Mystery Picture' 
		was written by PDG Ian Campbell and shows the depth of research to which 
		a simple problem can lead. Although it is a Paul Harris family related 
		photograph rather than a Rotary Global History one, it does show very clearly 
		how much there is to learn from a single item, in this case, one on show 
		in the Paul Harris Gallery.</p>
