		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19"  width: 50%>The lifespan of a man 
		born in 1868 was not long. A man of 37 was not considered young at all. 
		That was Paul Harris' age when he started Rotary. At the age of 44 he 
		suffered what he said was a &quot;heart attack.&quot; Rotary secretary Ches Perry, 
		in &quot;The Founder of Rotary&quot; writes about a serious physical breakdown.<br>
		<br>In The Rotarian under &quot;More or Less Personal&quot;, often short notes 
		about Paul are found, mostly concerning his health. The first one I know 
		of is from October 1912:<br><br>&quot;President Emeritus Paul P. Harris has 
		been confined to his residence for a couple of weeks by a severe cold. 
		They say: &quot;You can't keep a good man down&quot; and sure enough Paul is back 
		at his office but he admits that he feels a little run down and intends 
		to take things easy for awhile now he has shifted the responsibilities 
		of Rotarianism.&quot; Submitted by: RGHF Senior Historian Dr. Wolfgang 
		Ziegler 31 July 2006<br><br>Ches Perry write further about Paul's health 
		in a memorial speech at the
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/conventions/1947/index.htm">
		1947 international convention in San Francisco</a>.<br><br>What is 
		remarkable, as was reported in our &quot;What Paul Harris Wrote&quot; in early 
		2002, is that Paul Harris continued a grueling schedule for Rotary and 
		one of Chicago's most successful law practices for 35 more years. This 
		was an uncommon man.<br><br>

		clue about his recovery may be found in a discovered copy of
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/harris/signature/rotarianage/index.htm">
		&quot;This Rotarian Age&quot;</a> He describes in this section and attests to it 
		in the cover of book, that he had a serious mental breakdown in the 
		early 1930's<br><br>What Paul Harris Wrote ù&nbsp; ì 1912 and we almost 
		lost our founder. <br><br>On a never to be forgotten day, I was standing 
		at the speaker's table at a great meeting, having just finished an 
		address, when my lights went out. The last that I remember was of 
		falling across the table and of being surrounded by folks. Heart attack, 
		they called it. The specialist said it all when he said that I had over 
		drawn my account; that I was bankrupt and must liquidate my account with 
		nature. ù Paul P. Harris from My Road to Rotary, Page 289. <br><br>At 
		the end of his second term of office (1912) he suffered a serious
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/harris/library/founder/images/founder4-5.jpg" target="_blank">
		physical breakdown</a> from which he recovered only because of his 
		indomitable will to do so. He has constantly retained a deep interest in 
		the movement, together with a keen desire for its successful 
		development. ù Ches Perry, General Secretary of RI, in the forward to&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The Founder of Rotary ù by Paul Harris in 1928.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style25" height="123" src="42-02PHNotice02_small.jpg" style="float: left" width="203">Paul 
		Harris often described himself as too exhausted to attend events in his 
		lengthy overseas travels. Regardless, his remaining 35 years, after his 
		1912&nbsp;&nbsp; breakdown, ùwere his most productive. He leaves a 
		legacy that we will be discovering at Rotary Global History for years to 
		come. The entire forward by Ches Perry is now online in the&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Paul Harris ù section of our project. <br><br>And that's a Rotary minute 
		from Rotary Global History.<br><br>PAUL HARRIS' Journeys.<br><br>PAUL P. 
		HARRIS, Founder and President Emeritus of Rotary International, recently 
		returned to his Chicago home after several months' absence.<br>His first 
		stop was Clifton Springs, N. Y., where he underwent a serious operation, 
		from which he has thoroughly recovered. His next stop was in Vermont, 
		where he lived as a boy, whence he returned to Chicago.<br><br>While at 
		Clifton Springs, FOUNDER PAUL addressed an intercity meeting of 
		Rotarians with the Clifton Springs Club as host. About 400 guests from 
		New York and Canada, including many officers and past officers of Rotary 
		International, attended.<br><br>Speaking on &quot;The Genesis of Rotary,&quot; 
		FOUNDER PAUL said, in part:<br><br>I am introduced tonight as the 
		Founder of Rotary. . . . But in a movement which has been so fortunate 
		as to have tens of thousands of important business and professional men 
		always ready and willing to throw down their own business affairs and 
		devote their time to the service of the movement, the meaning of the 
		word &quot;founder&quot; has its limitations. . . .<br><br>Thoughts of Rotary 
		seldom turn backward. Some think they do not turn even to the present as 
		often as they should. As a matter of fact, I am still what I was in the 
		beginning, a dreamer. . . . To me, the glory of Rotary is still in the 
		future and my thoughts most naturally turn to its glory, as my eyes to 
		the rising sun. The past is dead. Let it sleep in peace. . . .<br><br>I 
		want to say that I believe Rotary Is one sound foundation on which world 
		peace can be predicated, and on no other foundation can permanent world 
		peace be successful. We consider ourselves ambassadors of goodwill, both 
		going and coming, planting friendship trees on all continents, 
		emblematic of the international understanding and goodwill for which 
		Rotary is standing.</td>
