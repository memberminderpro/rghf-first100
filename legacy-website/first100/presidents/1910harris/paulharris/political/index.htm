		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1910harris/paulharris/images/phphotosignedscan-reparedsmall.jpg" style="float: left">After initial hesitation about 
		ceding territory for the formation of new clubs, the London Rotary Club 
		had witnessed the opening of a second club in the capital in 1923 in 
		Streatham. By the time of Paul Harris' visit to London in 1934, there 
		were over one hundred clubs but it was appropriate that on Thursday 
		April 12, after a visit to the RIBI's offices in Tavistock Square, 
		Harris went to a lunch meeting of the Streatham Club. The meeting was 
		held at the Manor Arms, a public house in Streatham High Road, where he 
		was greeted by the President, the Rev W Charter Piggott and had his 
		photograph taken with Past President Samuel Stevens. Stevens was the 
		proprietor of the Streatham News in which the picture was subsequently 
		published!<br><br>The subject of the meeting was a talk by a visiting 
		Rotarian about a questionnaire sent to certain clubs by the Rawlins Club 
		of Wyoming. This asked for opinions about the situation in post war 
		Europe and the relations between Europe and the United States. Clubs 
		were asked to comment on these matters although as Harris wrote, &quot;If the 
		Rawlins Rotarians will subscribe to the London Times, the Manchester 
		Guardian and the Scotsman, they will be able to get carefully considered 
		presentations of view points which are the generally accepted view 
		points in Great Britain.&quot;<br><br>During his tour, Paul Harris had 
		already heard of this questionnaire from other British Rotarians 
		although he was apparently unaware of its purpose. Clearly, he did not 
		appear in much sympathy with it; the speaker certainly was not and 
		expressed his views with &quot;invectives which he brought to bear with 
		devastating effect on certain of the questions propounded by the Rotary 
		Club of Rawlins.&quot;<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="329" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1910harris/paulharris/political/images/statemap.jpg" style="float: left" width="458">Paul Harris was given the opportunity to 
		address the meeting but beyond describing his address as &quot;interesting&quot;, 
		the club's records do not suggest that he made any significant reference 
		to the questionnaire and he himself made no such entry in his account of 
		the day's events.<br><br>Afterwards, he was driven back to Central 
		London by Arthur N Monahan, the Streatham Club Vice President, who 
		&quot;expressed considerable embarrassment as to what had been said in my 
		presence...&quot;. Although Paul Harris had no doubts that Rotary should not 
		take political sides, he did feel, after this experience, that &quot;we may 
		find it necessary to modify or even to suspend our traditional policy of 
		avoiding political discussions.&quot; He was, however, well aware that to do 
		so would mean &quot;treading on dangerous ground.&quot; With the Second World War 
		but five years ahead and the disbanding of the Rotary Clubs in Germany 
		even nearer, this was a policy which would, in any case, soon need 
		modification.&quot;<br><br>This questionnaire may well have been unique but 
		it was a mammoth undertaking for a club of only 31 members. In its 
		report to the Governor of District 7 in January 1934, the Rawlins Club 
		wrote that its &quot;International Service Committee...has just recently 
		mailed a letter and questionnaire to every Rotary Club in the world 
		located outside of the United States. The postage on these letters alone 
		was 61.00 dollars. When the replies are received, we will have a 
		valuable contribution to make to Rotary - for this questionnaire covers 
		many of the most complex international problems of the day. Our ISC has 
		already received replies from several of the Canadian Clubs. The replies 
		are most interesting. The Rawlins Club believes that this questionnaire 
		to foreign clubs will be an out standing piece of international service 
		work for the Seventh District.&quot;<br><br>
		<img alt="Gen Rawlins" class="auto-style26" height="360" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1910harris/paulharris/political/images/Gen%20Rawlins_slide.jpg" style="float: left" width="390">At their District Conference in 
		Colorado Springs in May 1934, the club outlined their results and 
		stressed the worth and value of what they had done. By November when the 
		DG reported to RI on his visit to the club, over 1200 mailings had 
		resulted in over 600 replies and they were still coming in, indeed one 
		from the London Club arrived as he was making his visit. The DG was 
		clearly impressed and wrote to RI &quot;respectfully urging a complete and 
		exhaustive study and analysis of the many answers to the great Rawlins 
		Questionnaire&quot;. He described it as a &quot;most worthy effort to learn of the 
		world of thought of our Rotary brothers on subjects, that if discussed 
		sensibly and with honesty of desire could only promote better 
		understanding, and better understandings go for promotion of peace and 
		the elimination of warring purpose&quot;.<br><br>What happened to this 
		questionnaire and its conclusions is not clear. One copy of a club's 
		answers have turned up but no copy of the questions. This questionnaire 
		is one of the more curious and interesting episodes in the History and 
		it may be unique that a club as small as Rawlins was, should circulate 
		the entire movement outside the USA.<br><br>Basil Lewis</td>
