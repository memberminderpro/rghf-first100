		Photo 
		of Paul when he, briefly, took up flying, about 1910<br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="harrisfly.jpg" style="float: left">The 
		peregrinations of Paul Harris continue. Rotary's founder, who circled 
		the globe numerous times during the course of his life time, would, no 
		doubt, be pleased to know that his latest namesake, an asteroid, will be 
		circling the heavens for years to come. This is thanks to Dr. Eleanor 
		Helin, an astronomer at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego, 
		California, U.S.A. who discovered the celestial body.<br><br>Dr Helin, a 
		victim of polio, wanted to recognize Rotary for its global effort to 
		eradicate the disease and found an out-of-this-world way to do this by 
		naming the asteroid after our founder. Source: 1995 issue of the 
		district 1010 'Flyer' magazine. RGHF Senior Historian Basil Lewis, 
		England, 1 July 2009<br><br>Also, Paul's name is included in another 
		space project:<br><br>Note: As a public outreach effort, over 1 million 
		names were collected and placed on the STARDUST spacecraft, which will 
		visit Comet Wild 2 in 2004.<br><br>Including:<br><br>P HARRIS<br>PAIGE 
		E. HARRIS<br>PAUL P. HARRIS<br>PAULA HARRIS<br>PETER HARRIS<br><br>What 
		is the purpose of sending names into space?<br><br>Placing the names 
		onto the STARDUST spacecraft was a public outreach effort.<br>
		<img src="microchip_location.jpg"><br><img src="chip3.jpg"><img src="chip1.jpg"><br>
		It allowed people to be personally involved with the STARDUST Mission 
		and helps to promote public interest, awareness and support of the space 
		program. It also provided a way to honor individuals by enabling them to 
		be associated with mankind's most advanced technological endeavor and to 
		be part of the quest of the human species to reach for the stars.<br>
		<br>Where are the microchips now? <br><br>The microchips are in
		<a href="https://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/scnow.html">outer space 
		onboard the STARDUST spacecraft</a>, and also back on Earth. STARDUST
		<a href="https://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/scnow.html">was launched 
		on February 7, 199</a>9 carrying the two sets of microchips. Two copies 
		of each chip were installed on the spacecraft (for a total of four 
		chips). One set of microchips is mounted inside the Sample Return 
		Capsule, and was returned back to Earth with the capsule when it landed 
		in Utah on January 15, 2006. The capsule along with the microchips have 
		been transported to the curation facility at Johnson Space Center in 
		Houston, Texas on
		<a href="https://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/news/status/060115.html">January 
		17, 2006</a>, where they currently reside. The other set of chips is 
		mounted in the spacecraft body and will remain in space forever. <br>
		<br>Where are the microchips inside the Sample Return Capsule? <br><br>
		Refer to the photos below, which were taken prior to Stardust's launch.<br>
		<br>Photo of Microchip #1 Photo of Microchip #1 Diagram of Microchip 
		locations <br><br>How were the names collected? <br><br>During the first 
		name collection period in October-November 1997, the names were 
		submitted to the Planetary Society who collected the names for us. The 
		names were submitted by email, postcard or the Planetary Society home 
		page. During the second name collection period, which ran from May 1998 
		to August 1998, the names were submitted via the Web on the STARDUST 
		home page and the National Space Society home page. <br><br>How many 
		names are on the microchips? <br><br>There are two microchips. The first 
		one has 136,000 names and the second has over 1 million names. <br><br>
		Whose names are on the microchips? <br><br>The names on the microchips 
		are from individuals who submitted their own names along with the names 
		of friends and family if they chose to include them. Also,
		<a href="https://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news27.html">all members of 
		the Planetary Society and the National Space Society </a>current as of 
		1998 were included. In addition, as a special tribute, all names on the 
		Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, DC were included. And finally, the 
		names and selected photos of members of the STARDUST Mission team were 
		also included. <br><br>Will the microchips remain in space or will they 
		come back to Earth? <br><br>Both. Two copies of each microchip were 
		made. One set will remain in space in the STARDUST spacecraft which will 
		continue to orbit the Sun after the mission. The other set of chips will 
		be returned to Earth in the Sample Return Capsule. Plans are to place 
		the returned microchips in a major museum, most likely the Smithsonian 
		Air &amp; Space Museum in Washington, D.C.<br><br>How big are the 
		microchips? <br><br>The names are electronically etched onto a 
		fingernail-size silicon chip at JPL's Micro Devices Lab. Writing on the 
		microchip is so small that about 80 letters would equal the width of a 
		human hair. Once inscribed, the names can be read with a strong optical 
		microscope or an electron microscope. <br><br>Can you provide more 
		details on how the names were engraved onto the microchips?<br><br>Sure. 
		The process is rather technical, but we'll give it a try. First, note 
		that the microchip is not an a electronic part like a computer chip, but 
		is actually a silicon wafer. The names are placed onto the wafer chip 
		through a technique called Electron Beam Lithography. The wafer is 4 
		inches square initially and comes with a layer of silicon oxide on its 
		surface.. The wafer is coated with a thin photographic film of 
		photo-resist PMMA (pexiglass). The names are stored on a VAX computer 
		and converted into a format usable by the electron beam lithography 
		tool. The data is read and fed into the electron beam tool which 
		engraves the names into the PMMA surface of the wafer chip using a 
		highly-focused electron beam. The names can be written multiple times to 
		the wafer if we want to make multiple copies of the small microchip. The 
		wafer then goes through a process similar to developing film, where the 
		wafer is rinsed in a developer that removesexposed PMMA (or the area 
		written on by the electron beam). The next step is to coat the wafer 
		with a thin metal film (titanium &amp; platinum). This is done by placing it 
		in a vacuum chamber and heating a small amount of the metal, which 
		evaporates and coats the wafer by condensing on it. The wafer chip is 
		then placed in a solvent which dissolves away the remaining PPMA and any 
		metal attached to it, leaving behind the letters of the names. Finally, 
		the wafer is cut up into 1x1 centimeter-sized square chips. </td>
