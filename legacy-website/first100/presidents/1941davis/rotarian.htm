        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><style="font-size: 9pt">
		<font size="2">LOOK UP, almost any 
        night, at the darkened facade of the Metal's Bank Building in the old 
        copper city of Butte and you'll note a square of light on the sixth 
        floor. Someone up there is burning the midnight oil. Not a few passersby 
        well know who the toiler is.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">&quot;Tom works too hard,&quot; 
        they'll agree as they round the corner at Main and Park streets. &quot;Been 
        telling him that for years&#8209;but he won't let up.&quot;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">They refer to their 
        fellow townsman Tom J. Davis&#8209;by his own description &quot;just a crossroads 
        lawyer.&quot; But they know it isn't his law practice, large as it is, that 
        keeps this strong&#8209;jawed, silver-thatched citizen downtown of nights. 
        It's his lifelong practice of giving his ample brawn and his quick brain 
        to every good thing in town. Big things. Little things.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">&quot;My father used to tell 
        me that if I didn't slow down, I'd be old and worn out at 35,&quot; Tom Davis 
        recalls. Then, lowering his bushy brow in a wink, he adds, &quot;I'm somewhat 
        past 35 now and I don't feel like slowing down one bit. I hope I never 
        shall.&quot;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">It was on such a night 
        as I have described many years ago that a certain newcomer to Butte 
        pushed open Tom Davis's office door and asked if he could spare a few 
        minutes. Welcomed, the newcomer began a story, the upshot of which was 
        this: He had come to Butte as the new manager of the local agency of a 
        national corporation. Studying his predecessor's practices, he had found 
        much that he could not condone. Thus he had begun a thorough reform. His 
        brand of ethics demanded it. But his sales force, accustomed to the 
        various &quot;benefits&quot; that had been a part of the old regime, complained 
        volubly and began to work against him. Of late he had begun to question 
        his own stand. His resolution was flagging. A friend had advised that he 
        talk it over with Tom Davis.</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">Tom Davis had listened 
        quietly. Now it was his turn to speak.</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">&quot;Bill,&quot; he said in his 
        kind basso, &quot;you know you<i> </i>are right. Keep on being right. You 
        cannot beat old&#8209;fashioned honesty. I'll be watching you.&quot;</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">With bolstered resolve 
        the new manager went back to his agency, won his battle there, and by 
        virtue of that success climbed high in his company's management. Tom may 
        have forgotten the episode. This man, now 1,000 miles away from Butte, 
        never will.</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">Once in a while one 
        meets a man whose personal integrity is so real and so luminous that it 
        is reflected in the faces and actions of all who deal with him. Such a 
        man is Tom J. Davis, the man who will lead Rotary through the coming 12 
        months.</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">The people of Montana, 
        from the Canadian border on the north to the Wyoming&#8209;Idaho line on the 
        south, from the Powder River country in the east to the land of the 
        shining mountains in the west, are proud of Tom Davis. And they are 
        proud of the credit reflected upon their State by his election to the 
        Presidency of Rotary International. They know that Rotarians who have 
        not Yet met him will come to love him as the folks at home do&#8209;as a kind, 
        keen&#8209;witted, capable man, endowed with the finest qualities of 
        leadership and motivated by a deep urge to give his energies and 
        abilities for the service of others.</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">This sounds a little 
        lavish? It's not! It's what his friends think of him. It's what young 
        men whom he helped in their boyhood think of him. Let him walk into a 
        crowded banquet room and there are whispers of &quot;There's Tom Davis.&quot; Or 
        let it be announced that he is to speak at some affair and the place 
        will be packed.</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">&quot;He likes everybody and 
        everybody likes him,&quot; is the way one especially good friend, Ben Hardin, 
        a Butte Rotarian, sums it up.</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">Rotary's new 
        international President came into the world in the little community of 
        Weir City, Kansas, on January 30, 1888, and was christened [named] Thomas 
        Jefferson Davis. Butte has been his home since 1897, when his parents 
        moved west to the bustling mining camp of that lusty era.</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">The boy Tom Davis 
        showed signs of what the man would become. His superior intellectual 
        equipment and his excellence at sports made him a natural leader. 
        Selling papers on Butte streets and later peddling carpets gave him 
        status as an ambitious boy-businessman among his young friends. After 
        high school and a business&#8209;college course, Tom Davis decided to study 
        law, so off he went to Ann Arbor, Michigan, to prepare himself at the 
        University of Michigan Law School.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">TOM DAVIS worked his 
        way. In spite of (or because of) that, he won honors which brought him 
        an invitation to join the faculty there upon his graduation in 1912. He 
        declined.</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">&quot;I wanted to come back 
        to Butte,&quot; he explains. &quot;I was anxious to start my law practice.&quot;</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">Now husky young Tom had 
        set some splendid records in baseball, boxing, and track, and had often 
        been encouraged to try a boxing career. In his last days on the Michigan 
        campus, with the course of his life well set, along came an offer to him 
        from the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team. It was a tempting opportunity 
        for a young man with the spirit, courage, and splendid physique of Tom 
        Davis. But he decided against it. He wanted none of the quick but fading 
        glory of professional sports. His interest in athletics was keen., but 
        he played the games for sheer love of them. So, wisely, he came back to 
        Butte and &#8209; with $8 - started building a law practice of prominence.</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">Butte in those days was 
        what magazine writers insist on describing as &quot;a wide&#8209;open, roaring 
        mining camp.&quot; Thousands of young men crowded the city, and decent 
        recreational facilities for them were virtually nonexistent.</font></font></font></font></font></font></td>

		<font size="2">The young lawyer, with 
        other men of like mind, decided that something must be done. The Butte 
        Young Men's Association resulted and that group, in turn, brought to 
        Butte its modern Y.M.C.A. building, a boon to the miners and a boys' 
        paradise for youngsters who had had no place to play except on the 
        sprawling mine dumps of the camp.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">That is typical of the 
        kind of &quot;helping out&quot; Tom Davis so much enjoys. His greatest interest 
        always has been in assisting youth and he put his talents in that field 
        to work when he headed Rotary's international Youth Committee.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">It was 26 years ago 
        that Tom Davis joined the new Butte Rotary Club and found therein the 
        high purposes and the opportunity for active service he sought. Soon he 
        became one of the most prominent members of the Club, serving as 
        President in 1920&#8209;21. In 1921 he was elected Governor of the old 20th 
        District, which included Montana, Idaho, and Utah. Three years later he 
        became Third Vice&#8209;President of Rotary International. Through the years 
        he has served on virtually every major international Committee and 
        during the past Rotary year was Chairman of the Aims and Objects 
        Committee.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">In the practice of law 
        he has achieved an enviable reputation, known the length and breadth of 
        Montana&#8209;and beyond. Recognizing this fact, four educational institutions 
        have conferred upon him honorary doctor's degrees. He is retained as 
        counsel for 13 industrial and commercial concerns, such as the Soo 
        Lines, Safeway Stores, F. W. Woolworth Company, and Northwest Casualty 
        Company. The name of Tom Davis frequently appears in the court records 
        as the attorney for the &quot;underdog&quot; and the client of which he is most 
        proud is Butte Miners Union No. 1, in which his father formerly &quot;carried 
        a card.&quot; Amazing, isn't it, that one man can be counsel for both 
        management and labor? Not at all! Tom Davis is just one thing (not all 
        things) to all men: honest, hard&#8209;hitting, helpful Tom Davis.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">A compelling speaker, 
        he has talked in every State of the United States as well as in several 
        cities of Canada and Mexico.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">His great capacity for 
        friendship and great willingness to help have brought him 
        responsibilities in several organizations. For a number of years he has 
        been a director of the Butte Y.M.C.A., a director of the Butte Chamber 
        of Commerce and of the Salvation Army, and has served other 
        organizations too numerous to mention. Recently he was appointed to the 
        Butte Airport Commission, which is charged with the important job of 
        bringing the air field up to Government requirements as a link in the 
        chain of potential national&#8209;defense bases.</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">Yes, Tom Davis is a 
        busy man. He is at his office early in the morning, probably in court a 
        short time later, out for a luncheon meeting with fellow directors of 
        one of the organizations he serves, and then back to his duties. At the 
        close of the business day he hurries home to his devoted family. 
        Frequently, in the evening hours, he is engaged in work for others. How 
        he finds time to do it all is a miracle.</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">His wife is the former 
        Hester Christen, a charming lady to whom he gives much credit for his 
        success. The Davis family is a model one, rich with devotion, happiness, 
        and all the finest points of American family life. There are three 
        children. Peggy, the elder daughter, is director of physical education 
        in the Helena, Montana, schools; Tom, Jr., recently married, is an 
        instructor in the United States Army Air Corps at Sacramento, 
        California; and Shirley is a student at the Butte High School. Of 
        course, Rotary's First Man and Lady will protest that they are only 
        ordinary folks&#8209;the average parents of normal children.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">&quot;AREN'T you rather 
        excited about becoming President of Rotary International?&quot; the writer 
        asked Tom Davis.</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">The new President 
        smiled. &quot;Who wouldn't be excited? I'm excited and proud. And I'm 
        determined to do my very best for Rotary. I expect a year of hard work, 
        but at the same time I know that serving Rotary in this manner probably 
        will be the happiest experience of my life.&quot;</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">We of Montana who know 
        Tom Davis have no doubts about the well&#8209;being and progress of Rotary 
        with him at the helm. We know that the Presidency has been placed upon 
        the shoulders of a man who will be<b> </b>a credit to the post. We like 
        and admire Tom Davis&#8209;and we know you will, too.</font></font></p>
