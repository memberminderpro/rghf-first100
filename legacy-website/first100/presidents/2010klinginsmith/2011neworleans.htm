    	Well, there’s that cowboy 
		song again! And you will hear it again tonight during Michael Martin 
		Murphey’s performance. Then as a Rotary theme song, it probably will 
		fade into Rotary history to be known only to the members of the Rotary 
		Global History Fellowship, who studiously preserve the records of our 
		Rotary heritage. Hopefully, the fellowship leaders will place the song 
		on their website, so I can listen to it occasionally!<br><br>But Cowboy 
		Logic is more than a song. It also is the simple wisdom of the words 
		that call on us to do our best in everything we undertake. The message 
		of the song is reinforced by the book entitled Cowboy Ethics in which 
		Jim Owens has distilled the famous, but unwritten, Code of the West into 
		10 principles, which are well aligned with our Four Way Test.<br><br>And 
		the words of the song are further enhanced by some of the humorous, but 
		meaningful, quotations in the Texas Bix Bender book called A Cowboy’s 
		Guide to Life, which includes the well known title of Don’t Squat with 
		Your Spurs On!<br><br>So what is it about Cowboy Logic that is 
		applicable to Rotary? The members of the two Rotary clubs in my small 
		city of Kirksville know that I am not a real cowboy. However, I spent my 
		early years on the farm, and I have retained my love of the land and the 
		animals. And I have learned that all around the world there is a common 
		bond of the people who tend the land and raise the animals. It requires 
		an ability to work alone with only the sky above, and it fosters a 
		simple approach to life in order to do what has to be done. It creates a 
		“can do” attitude and a willingness to help one’s neighbors. And it is 
		that combination of values that give rise to the Spirit of Rotary, which 
		has been the hallmark of our great organization for more than 100 years!
		<br><br>When I joined Rotary 50 years ago, I often heard the slogan 
		“Keep Rotary Simple”, which was part of past RI president Gian Paolo 
		Lang’s theme in 1956-57. But I have not heard that phrase in recent 
		years, and my use of Cowboy Logic has been to test the practices of what 
		we do in Rotary and how we do it. We are such creatures of habit in 
		Rotary because we change officers every year, and the easiest thing to 
		do for a single year is to do what was done last year. Yet we know that 
		society is constantly changing around us. None of us are operating our 
		businesses or professions in the same way that we did 20 to 30 years 
		ago, but we are content to keep our Rotary clubs the same while the 
		world moves on. As the cowboys say, “If you keep on doing what you been 
		doing, you’ll keep on getting what you got!” And for those of us in 
		Rotary, it means that our membership is not growing in the positive way 
		that it did for several decades before the 1990s.<br><br>We need to take 
		a simple and straightforward look at our practices at all levels of 
		Rotary and to analyze which ones are merely traditions that should be 
		replaced by new and more modern concepts. That is Cowboy Logic, or 
		common sense, whichever you prefer to call it. The RI board has taken 
		that approach this year, and it has worked well. We eliminated several 
		committees, and we did not ask other committees to meet. As a result, we 
		saved a substantial amount of money, and we escaped the burden of 
		processing so many committee reports. An even more a significant result 
		was that the RI board was able to concentrate on some big picture items 
		and to do some serious brainstorming about major improvements.<br><br>I 
		won’t try to list many of the improvements for you this afternoon, 
		because the convention is drawing to a close, and then it will be party 
		time in New Orleans this evening. Therefore, I will limit the number of 
		major items that have been addressed by the RI board. The first is a 
		move to provide regional assistance for districts and clubs through the 
		new Rotary Coordinators, and the even newer Rotary Public Image 
		Coordinators, to work with the well established Regional Rotary 
		Foundation Coordinators, commonly known as RRFCs. The second is the 
		development of a more productive relationship with the Rotarian Action 
		Groups, commonly known as RAGS. The third is an improved approach to 
		move toward a more uniform size of Rotary districts. And the fourth is a 
		plan to improve the process for selecting and training district 
		governors and to better utilize the service opportunities for past 
		district governors. All of these, along with a proper implementation of 
		the RI Strategic Plan, will have lasting benefits for Rotary.<br><br>
		Given my bias, I think this year has been a good year for Rotary as we 
		have worked to Build Communities and Bridge Continents. Certainly the 
		displays and the atmosphere at this convention have reinforced my 
		preliminary assessment. Although we do not yet have the final results 
		for the Presidential Citation program, I am pleased to report that at 
		least six districts had more than 90% of their clubs qualify for the 
		citation, and another 19 districts had more than 80% of their clubs to 
		earn the citation. Of course, the real test of whether our clubs have 
		become Bigger, Better, and Bolder will have to wait for a few years. But 
		at least, we are now talking about the need, and the outstanding 
		potential, for our clubs to become Bigger, Better, and Bolder! <br><br>
		We have so much to be proud of as Rotarians. There has never been a more 
		exciting time to be Rotarians as we approach the end of polio and as we 
		anticipate the favorable publicity that Rotary will receive for its 
		three decades of work and commitment. Our community service projects 
		around the world are estimated to provide local investments of more than 
		a billion US dollars every year, and our youth and young adult programs 
		are the best in the world. And our Rotary Foundation continues to gain 
		strength as it assists our clubs and districts with international 
		service projects. <br><br>Our new strategic plan for RI is an excellent 
		example of simplicity and clarity. The three priorities are to support 
		and strengthen our clubs, to focus and increase our humanitarian 
		service, and to enhance our public image and awareness. And the RI board 
		is actively implementing the plan in a variety of ways, including 
		several pilot projects to permit clubs to experiment with new methods to 
		strengthen their clubs. If the new methods work well, they will be 
		submitted to the next Council on Legislation for approval in 2013. If 
		they don’t work well, they can be scrapped in favor of still better 
		ideas to come from our clubs in the future, because Rotary is truly, -- 
		and proudly, -- a grass roots organization!<br><br>One more achievement 
		for the current Rotary year is the highly successful search for a new 
		general secretary to replace Ed Futa, who is retiring this year after 11 
		years of service as the chief administrative officer for Rotary. The 
		international search produced more than 400 candidates for the position, 
		and it resulted in the employment of John Hewko. John’s employment as 
		the new general secretary was probably the most important decision made 
		by the RI board this year, and I am pleased to advise you that the 
		decision was made by a truly unanimous vote. John’s leadership will be 
		critical as we complete the polio eradication campaign and then take 
		advantage of the favorable attention that will be focused on Rotary!<br>
		<br>What a thrill it is to stand here and recite the outstanding work of 
		Rotary around the world. This convention has proven once more that 
		Rotary is a premier organization, which has maintained its core values 
		of fellowship, service, diversity, integrity, and leadership, while 
		changing to comply with societal changes. No wonder the students at 
		Northwestern University in Evanston, as part of a class project, 
		undertook a study of Rotary and then concluded that “Rotary is a 
		worldwide network of inspired individuals who translate their passions 
		into relevant social causes to change lives in communities”. <br><br>The 
		student’s summary is a great tribute to Rotary, so let me repeat it. 
		“Rotary is a worldwide network of inspired individuals who translate 
		their passions into relevant social causes to change lives in 
		communities”. No wonder the RI board has adopted that modern, but 
		simple, statement as the Core Essence of Rotary. To me, that makes good 
		sense! In fact, it is a clear case of Cowboy Logic!<br><br>The End</td>
