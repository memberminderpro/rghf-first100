		By John R. Sprague, San Antonio Rotarian<br><br>(Down in San Antonio the 
		Rotarians publish a little magazine which is called &quot;The Wheel of 
		Fortune&quot; and every issue contains a very cleverly written sketch of the 
		life of some member. It is stated that “Jack Sprague”, their jeweller 
		member, is the biographical raconteur. When the convention got to San 
		Antonio on the circle tour the visitors discovered that weeks issue of 
		&quot;The Wheel&quot; had accomplished a &quot;scoop&quot; in journalism by printing for the 
		first time the following intensely interesting sketch of our new 
		president.)<br><br>THIS is the time I put one over on you. You opened 
		your WHEEL OF FORTUNE languidly, expecting to read as usual the life of. 
		some common or garden variety of Rotarian, when who should suddenly 
		appear before your astonished gaze but the photograph and life story of 
		the Big Boy of all Rotary, the Cicero of the International Association, 
		the man who has just been elected president, in short, Frank Mulholland 
		of Toledo, Ohio.<br><br>It 
		makes me mad to think how hard I have worked to make interesting reading 
		out of the life story of some of you San Antonio Rotarians when the most 
		exciting thing you ever did was to graduate from the local high school, 
		and the longest journey you ever took was your wedding trip to Corpus 
		Christi.<br><br>But with Frank Mulholland it is 
		entirely different. He is a live one.<br><br>It is almost pitiful the 
		way in which I have had to play up trifling incidents in the lives of 
		some of you fellows in order to make any kind of a story at all.<br><br>For instance if any of you got expelled from school I gave 
		it half a column. But Frank Mulholland got expelled twice and in the 
		mass of other incidents I pass it by with hardly an honorable mention.<br>
		<br>When our own Judge Archer started to run for Congress we were nearly 
		tickled to death at the prominence of it. But Frank not only ran for 
		Congress but got defeated as well.<br><br>Frank was born 39 
		years ago in a metropolis of about 800 souls, called Disco, in the State 
		of Michigan.<br><br>By birth, therefore, he is a Ruben. He may have 
		looked like a Ruben at one time but he certainly does not look like one 
		now. Please take another look at the picture.<br><br>By the way, 
		Toledo itself is something of a Tank town in now I believe. It does not 
		maintain a league ball team.<br><br>Frank's father was a Methodist 
		minister and as three years is the limit of a pastorate in the Methodist 
		church, Frank will be in the same class with Homer when he becomes 
		celebrated enough for the different towns he lived in to begin claiming 
		to be his birthplace.<br><br>When Frank was 19 he took his grand 
		adventure which was in the guise of a trip across the Atlantic in a 
		cattle ship and a bicycle tour of Europe a la Harry Franck, which means 
		earning your way as you go.<br><br>He was particularly fascinated with 
		Greece and stayed long enough in Athens to write a lecture which he 
		still occasionally delivers before high schools and Christian Endeavor 
		gatherings. I have never heard the lecture but I will bet the opening 
		words are: &quot;I bring you a message from Acropolis&#8209;crowned Athens, ancient 
		mother of all the arts.&quot;<br><br>Be that as it may, Frank finally came 
		back to America and decided to be a lawyer. He went to night school in 
		Detroit, and just to show that he was a real man, took a job in a 
		laundry day times to pay expenses.<br><br>After a year in Detroit he 
		entered the law school at Ann Arbor and there took his degree.<br><br>
		Then he went to Toledo (which was in the league at that time), and began 
		to practice law whenever he could get a client.<br><br>This was sixteen 
		years ago and the clients have gotten a little thicker each year. When 
		the right kind of a man gets his living assured he looks about to see 
		what he can do in a useful way and that is the reason Frank became so 
		active in Toledo's civic life.<br><br>They do say he was the most 
		efficient president that the Toledo Chamber of Commerce ever had. About 
		three years ago Frank was attacked by Rotarians, and it hit him hard. He 
		liked its ethics, its good fellowship and its opportunities for service. 
		During the past year he has spoken before many of the clubs in the 
		&#8209;United States and all of those in Great Britain.<br><br>He has earned 
		his presidency fairly and the Association is mighty lucky to get him.<br>
		<br>Just one thing more. Men are wonderfully alike, and women are even 
		more so.<br><br>You know when I write up the local members I often 
		mention how pleased their wives are in giving the data for their 
		husbands' life stories.<br><br>Well I must confess that I approached 
		Mrs. Mulholland in the Rice Hotel the other day with some misgivings. I 
		was a little afraid that the wife of a man who had run for Congress and 
		had delivered lectures about the Parthenon and who was about to be 
		elected Rotary's president, might be inclined to belittle a story which 
		was to be printed only in the San Antonio, WHEEL OF FORTUNE.<br><br>But 
		she was just as pleased as any of our wives have been in similar 
		circumstances. She thinks Frank is the finest man in the world and is 
		glad to have even the humble WHEEL OF FORTUNE tell folks about it. She 
		has the true Rotary spirit. So have we. And that is why THE WHEEL OF 
		FORTUNE says with reverence&#8209;for Rotary rightly taken, is, as deep a 
		religion as any&#8209;God bless and prosper the career of Frank Mulholland, 
		the new president of Rotary.<br><br>From an article in The Rotarian</td>
