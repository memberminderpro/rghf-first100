		The following article is another in a series of messages from the men 
		who have been at the helm of the movement that has become Rotary 
		International. Frank L. Mulholland, the fourth Rotary President, 
		presented this think-piece on war, racial ridicule and the Sixth Object 
		of Rotary, which appeared in The Rotarian in May of 1934. The reader 
		will note that the writing was very concise, logical, well-thought-out 
		and orderly. That was not because Mulholland was a Past President of 
		Rotary. Rather, it was an indication of his education and training. 
		Originally from Toledo, Mulholland was a graduate of Albion, and was 
		nationally known as an expert in Labor Law.<br><br>The series, called a 
		Past President's Page, ran in The Rotarian in the mid 1930s. Those 
		submitting Past President's Pages included Paul Harris, Glenn Mead, 
		Russell Greiner, Frank Mulholland, Allen Albert and Arch Klumph.<br><br>
		Doug Rudman<br><br>Racial Ridicule–The Seeds of War<br><br>By 
		Frank L. Mulholland<br><br>President, Rotary International (1914-15)<br>
		<br>THE UTOPIAN dream created in the minds of some members by the advent 
		of the Sixth Object into Rotary must be dispelled by the crushing 
		realism of fact in order to reach the practical possibilities of its 
		purpose. No man in Rotary feels more keenly than I, the desire, the 
		hope, the inspiration that this objective may be more than an exotic 
		vision doomed to destruction upon the reefs of misguided indifference. 
		If Rotary is to achieve its goal of sympathetic understanding among the 
		nations of the world, it must meet a new challenge. Individual Rotarians 
		must nurture the idea in sincerity; must adopt it in practice.<br><br>
		For the past six months, the ghostly spectre of the fear of war has 
		permeated the hearts of the people of all nations. The press, our 
		conversation, our thoughts, have dwelt upon the ever increasing 
		propaganda that nations are baring their fangs in sullen preparation for 
		the defense of nationalism. The international optimism and hope of a few 
		years ago is fading like the morning mist of a summer day. The tom-toms 
		are beating, and fires are being rekindled for rehearsals of the war 
		dance. The muttering rumble of hate is increasing in volume in utter 
		disregard of the bloody debacle of only fifteen years ago. Espionage, 
		armament, secret alliances, censorship, and other off springs of Mars 
		are again showing their faces over the heretofore peaceful horizon.<br>
		<br>None of us has the desire to slip into the indescribable horror of 
		another world conflict. Our friends across the sea have no desire to 
		drag their loved ones into graves beside the fathers, brothers, or 
		neighbors so recently sacrificed to no avail. Yet the world is ripe for 
		another sacrificial offering to the Gods of Despair. In whose hearts 
		burns this passion for war? To what may we attribute this malignant 
		growth?<br><br>Rotary to me has held the promise of real achievement. I 
		rejoice in my many friendships in Japan, China, Germany, Great Britain, 
		and other nations of the world. I revere their affections, respect their 
		convictions, and love them as the men that they are. The thought is 
		abhorrent that I should ever face them over the bloody field of battle 
		with the lust to kill, to maim, or to destroy. It is inconceivable to me 
		that they could burn with a passion to bring sorrow, futility, or death 
		to me or mine. Experience has taught us the contrary, however, and the 
		cultivating of the seeds of hatred has brought father and son in the 
		death throes of imagined principles; brothers at each other's throats 
		with bayonet points; friends in the grapple of mortal combat.<br><br>
		This international friendship which we are so prone to wear merely as a 
		cloak must become a living thing. It must progress from its pre-natal 
		state, and be born into our every-day routine. It takes little 
		self-analysis to discover the existence in most men of all nations the 
		germ of prejudice and partiality, which we must destroy. It lurks in 
		more aggravated stages in some than in others, yet the natural barriers, 
		the products of generations of nationalistic thought, are not easily 
		destroyed. You may say, what is the solution?<br><br>MAY I respectfully 
		suggest that the Italian, Frenchman, Pole, Hungarian, or any other 
		citizen of a nation foreign to our own, is imbued with a pride of 
		country which resents the slurs so commonly bandied on careless lips. 
		Ridicule, more than anything else, breeds hatred. Much has been written, 
		and I would like to vouch for its veracity, that the tendency to scoff 
		at the customs of the people of other lands does much to bring about a 
		lack of understanding. We must remember that however strange and absurd 
		the manner of living of our friends in other countries may seem to us, 
		our method of doing things seems equally absurd to them.<br><br>If we 
		could carry the Golden Rule into actual practice in the dealings among 
		the people of the world, we would be close to a solution of this 
		problem. If you and I, as we penetrate the four corners of the earth, 
		and as we welcome to our shores the people of other nations, would 
		respect them and their customs, having in mind that we would appreciate 
		their respect of ours, the step would be forward.<br><br>If when we 
		think of the lands to which others owe allegiance, we would not see them 
		as the pink or blue blotches of a geographical map, nor as a kingdom or 
		republic, their people as Fascists, Nazis, Yankees, Liberals, or 
		Conservatives, but would think only of individuals, human like 
		ourselves, with our own like and dislikes, we would be reaching in the 
		right direction.<br><br>Would it please you to see the citizen of a 
		nation foreign to yours salute your flag? Then salute his. Would you 
		appreciate his rising to the notes of your national anthem? Then rise 
		when his is played. Would you desire his giving you an unprejudiced 
		hearing as to your country's side of a debated question? Then keep an 
		open mind until you hear his side. Would you be gratified in his 
		respectful observance of your customs? Then show him the same respect.<br>
		<br>It is now and always has been my hope that Rotary might provide the 
		medium through which individual understanding might prove to be the iron 
		links which would form the chain that binds war in oblivion. The 
		formality and policy behind diplomatic negotiations proves too great a 
		barrier to surmount.<br><br>The one sure but slow approach lies in you, 
		as individual Rotarians, not as a group, a district, an area, or an 
		international organization. When you will accept it as your individual 
		duty to be man to man, friend to friend, neighbor to neighbor, with 
		those in other countries who are just as conscientiously and sincerely 
		grasping for the higher ideals of the Rotary movement, then there will 
		be a swing of the pendulum towards this intangible something for which 
		the world is hungry.<br><br>That, as I see it, is the challenge to 
		Rotary in its Sixth Object. It is a challenge to each Rotarian, and as 
		we meet it squarely, fairly, and fearlessly, the tom-toms will stop 
		beating, the fires will be smothered, the fear will be dispelled. Idle 
		words must be replaced with heart-felt sincerity. It is truly an object 
		worthy of Rotary and Rotarians.</td>
