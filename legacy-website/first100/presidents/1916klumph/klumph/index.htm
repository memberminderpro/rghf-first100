		<img class="auto-style25" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1916klumph/images/oboothe002p1.jpg" style="float: left">In 
		a dusty warehouse in Stratford on Avon in England, there lies a portrait 
		of the noted American Shakespearean actor, Edwin Booth. Once upon a 
		time, this picture had an inscription on it reminding everyone that it 
		had been presented by American Rotarians. Indeed, when Paul Harris was 
		touring Britain in 1928, he made a special point of visiting 
		Stratford-on-Avon where, on Friday June 1, he was shown some of the many 
		places of interest in the town by the local Rotary President Fred 
		Ballance and the Secretary, Robert Lunn. In particular he asked to see 
		the full length portrait of the &quot;celebrated tragedian Edwin Booth&quot;, the 
		brother of John Wilkes Booth, who shot Abraham Lincoln.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style25" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1916klumph/images/00405300.gif" style="float: left">The 
		story of how this came to be in Stratford is complicated. It all started 
		at the 1921 Convention in Edinburgh. There, Past President of Rotary, 
		Arch Klumph, learned that the United States was the only country in 
		which the plays of William Shakespeare were regularly performed, but 
		which had no item on display in the Memorial Theatre Gallery at 
		Stratford on Avon. He happened to mention this to a fellow member of the 
		Cleveland Club, E.F. Albee the well known impresario. On their return to 
		the United States, Albee immediately commissioned J.A. Mohlte, a well 
		respected New York artist, to paint a replica of the famous painting of 
		Edwin Booth by Sargent, the original of which hung in the Players Club 
		in New York. On August 24, 1922, at a meeting of the New York Rotary 
		Club held at the Hotel Astor, Albee presented the Mohlte portrait to 
		Rotary so that it could be donated by them to the Stratford gallery. The 
		meeting at the Astor was attended by a distinguished group of more than 
		700 members and guests, among them such luminaries as Eugene O'Neil and 
		Robert Mantell. A full record of the key speeches can be found in 'The 
		Rotarian' for October 1922. For a few days the painting was exhibited at 
		the Knoedler Gallery in New York and then on September 1, it was taken 
		by a group of Rotarians, led by Arch Klumph, on board the S.S. Majestic 
		and escorted to England.<br><br>Later that month, on September 29, 1922, 
		the little group, complete with the picture, arrived in Stratford on 
		Avon for the presentation. A very distinguished party of Rotarians and 
		celebrities processed through the streets of the town to the theatre, 
		led by the civic mace bearers in full period costume, and by the Mayor 
		of Stratford. Members of the Board of Governors of the Memorial Theatre 
		and of British Rotary joined the procession, and in the auditorium the 
		waiting audience included Count John McCormack the Irish singer, Mary 
		Anderson, Marie Corelli and many senior Diplomats, Rotarians and local 
		dignitaries.<br><br>

		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1916klumph/klumph/booth/booth1_small.jpg" style="float: left"></a>Arch 
		C. Klumph, who had been commissioned to act on behalf of RI, made the 
		presentation to the Governors of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at a 
		ceremony arranged with the help of local Rotarians and of the Birmingham 
		Rotary Club in particular, and of the Rotary International Association 
		for Great Britain and Ireland in general. The portrait not only filled 
		the gap in the Gallery's array, but served as a memorial to Edwin Booth, 
		one of America's greatest Shakespearean actors; it was an inspiration to 
		future actors, and an expression of international appreciation. Both 
		Klumph's speech and those of other speakers were also reported in full 
		in 'The Rotarian' for December 1922. Madame de Navarro, better known as 
		the actress Mary Anderson spoke eloquently about Booth and his superb 
		interpretations of Shakespearean characters, at a celebratory dinner 
		that evening. The three volumes were found later at the home of Arch 
		Klumph's grandson and were brought to the 2009 Convention in Birmingham 
		by members of the Cleveland Club. Afterwards, they were taken back to 
		Ohio.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style25" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/foundation/programs/foundation/images/klumph_history_small.jpg" style="float: left">This 
		was not, however, the end of the story, because the Memorial Theatre was 
		destroyed in a disastrous fire in March 1926. Luckily the Library and 
		the Memorial Gallery escaped more or less intact and the picture was 
		still on show when Paul Harris visited there in 1928. The theatre itself 
		was rebuilt in 1932 and the portrait was for many years on show 
		alongside those of such other celebrated Shakespearean actors as David 
		Garrick, Sarah Siddons and Ellen Terry. According to a small plaque on 
		it, the painting was &quot;Presented by Arch Klumph of Cleveland, on behalf 
		of Rotary International, to the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre.&quot; With 
		increasing pressure on space in recent years, some of the items in the 
		gallery have had to be put in store in the theatre's Costume and 
		Artifacts warehouse and the Mohlte picture is one of these. Perhaps, if 
		there was enough interest, the picture could be retrieved, restored and 
		either put on show in the nearby RIBI offices in Alcester or even 
		returned to American Rotary.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style25" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1916klumph/images/tony8a.jpg" style="float: left">So 
		what has this to do with the Former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair? 
		For those who may be unaware, the wife of the present British Prime 
		Minister was formerly Cherie Booth. She shares with John Wilkes Booth 
		and Edwin, a common descent from one Richard Booth. John Wilkes Booth, 
		who was born in 1838, was the grandson of Richard Booth, a lawyer, and 
		his wife Jane Elizabeth Game. Another of Richard Booth's sons was 
		Algernon Sidney Booth and it is this Booth who was the great, great, 
		great, grandfather of Cherie. This is just the sort of connection which 
		we in the Genealogy Fellowship like to make!<br><br>Basil Lewis UK,
