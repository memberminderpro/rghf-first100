		While we don’t have a document stating that he was responsible, it 
		appears that the editorial staff member referred to was Leland Case, the 
		magazine’s editor. A few years later, an attempt to oust Case was made, 
		and language similar to Klumph’s was used as one of the reasons.<br><br>
		The series, called a Past President's Page, ran in The Rotarian in the

		Glenn Mead, Russell Greiner, Frank Mulholland, Allen Albert and Arch 
		Klumph.<br><br><strong>Lesson from an Old Memory</strong><br><br>By 
		Arch C. Klumph<br>President of Rotary International (1916-17)<br><br>
		DURING the forty-five years of my business life I have encountered many 
		expert and superb salesmen, but never one more capable than a certain 
		member of the editorial staff of THE ROTARIAN; his method is persistence 
		and determination with &quot;numerous repetitions.&quot; He started on me in 
		April. I countered with postponements. He attacked again in July. I 
		sidestepped with excuses. In September I dodged him on numerous 
		occasions, but recently he got me cornered in a room, a very small room, 
		at headquarters. He stood between me and the door (he will not deny the 
		truth of this scene) and began his sales talk on an article for the 
		magazine. So in desperation I replied with much emphasis: &quot;All right, 
		all right, all right.&quot; Thus when I have finished this task what a relief 
		to feel that he will no longer be dogging my footsteps and disturbing my 
		peace of mind.<br><br>I was not allowed to choose my topic­­–this fellow 
		prescribed it for me: &quot;The Rotary Foundation.&quot; And so now to the 
		subject:<br><br>After many years of discussion and thought, President 
		&quot;Don&quot; Adams in 1925 took the first step toward final plans for acquiring 
		a Rotary endowment fund. Each subsequent administration has given 
		~support to the movement. The conventions of 1927 and 1928 by unanimous 
		vote provided the necessary constitutional and by-law provisions.<br>
		<br>The foundation is merely an instrument or department established by 
		Rotary International to administer the endowment fund under the 
		jurisdiction of five trustees appointed by the president and Board of 
		Directors, each trustee serving a term of five years, one only retiring 
		each year. It is possible that in the years to come this fund may reach 
		into the millions. Thus the necessity of trustees serving a long term. 
		Experience and business prudence have proven that philanthropists will 
		not bequeath large sums to institutions where the management of the 
		funds is changed every twelve months, whether it be officers, directors, 
		trustees, boards of control, or any other group. <br><br>It was intended 
		that the Board of Directors in appointing these trustees would select 
		men of long and well-known experience in Rotary, men capable of 
		investing the funds and upon whose judgment the income or corpus would 
		be wisely directed. An amendment to the by-laws has recently been 
		recommended, which will provide that the Board of Trustees shall 
		automatically consist of the five immediate past presidents. Here you 
		will have experience by the &quot;men of the hour,&quot; and as the individual 
		Rotarians throughout the world (through their club representatives) 
		elect Rotary International's presidents, so they will, at the same time, 
		be selecting the future foundation trustees.<br><br>But perhaps you ask: 
		Now that Rotary has gone through the depression without serious 
		financial loss, why do we need to worry about the future? Why a 
		foundation?<br><br>Well, my answer is that if any individual will write 
		me a letter stating that we are through with this depression, I will 
		pack up my few belongings and migrate at once to his town.<br><br>Other 
		capable thinkers say: &quot;We are just entering the depression.&quot; I choose a 
		middle-of-the-road prophecy: &quot;We are slowly licking the mightiest 
		economic famine in the world's history but probably four more years will 
		be needed to finish the job. But whenever it is finished, we shall not 
		come out through the door, which we entered. We will come out to a much 
		changed social and economic order one in which there will be fewer great 
		wealths and more modest but better distributed incomes.&quot;<br><br>| 
		ANALYZE Rotary's future growth and success as comparable to the science 
		of airplane motivity. The plane must keep going at a rapid speed to stay 
		up. If it marks time, it falls. Just so with Rotary.<br><br>In 1914, 
		Rotary kept going on two activities—Club Service and Community Service. 
		The total expense of operation that year was less than $20,000. Now 
		supposing we had stopped there, would we be alive today? Would our 
		membership have increased from less than 20,000 to 152,000, from 120 
		clubs to 3,700 clubs, and would Rotary be established in some 70 nations 
		and/or geographical divisions? But we went ahead rapidly, adding 
		Vocational Service, Boys' Work, Crippled Children Work, International 
		Service, and many other worthy undertakings, all of which has resulted 
		in an annual expense in 1934-35 of approximately $646,000.<br><br>What 
		can we see ahead of us in the way of further extension? Today there are 
		certain nations with populations of approximately 45,000,000; one has 
		fourteen Rotary clubs, another twenty-nine. There is a possibility that 
		each of these countries may eventually have 700 clubs. So it is not an 
		idle dream to prophesy Rotary in 1950 with 10,000 clubs.<br><br>Rotary 
		will constantly find it necessary to seek new fields of service. Think 
		of the possibilities of helpful service in developments in science, 
		education, art, health protection. When we mention the possibility of 
		unusual emergencies or catastrophes in the future, some scoff at the 
		idea, but let me suggest that they take down from the shelf that musty 
		and aged book entitled &quot;History,&quot; wipe off the dust, and read the 
		experiences of the past thousand years­–then think.<br><br>Rotary has a 
		surplus of $634,000–just about the amount required to cover one year's 
		operation, if its income were interrupted–and this is not beyond the; 
		bounds of possibility at all. So you see, while we are very proud of our 
		present financial condition, yet our future is nevertheless deserving of 
		thought.<br><br>Are we restricted to certain specific uses of the 
		income?<br><br>The by-laws of Rotary International very wisely provide 
		for the necessary flexibility. Permanent endowments, where income only 
		is to be used, are restricted by the statutes of many states to charity 
		and education. Court decisions, however, have so interpreted the term 
		&quot;charity and education&quot; that it would apply to almost all of Rotary's 
		activities. The Trustees of the Foundation, with the approval of the 
		Board of Directors of Rotary International, may determine from time to 
		time the most essential needs. However, any donor may specify a purpose 
		for his gift, which the trustees may accept or reject. ~ The Sixth 
		Object of Rotary provides unlimited opportunities for the use of an 
		endowment fund of large proportions. There is a strong belief at the 
		present time that Rotary could render a service of immeasurable value by 
		sending from nation to nation men of outstanding ability to carry the 
		message not only of the Sixth Object but of the whole spirit of 
		Rotary–the ideal of service.<br><br>The recent Rotary tour of immediate 
		Past President John Nelson brought great credit not only to himself, 
		but, more particularly to the organization. Word comes from every 
		country he visited testifying to the good seed, which he planted.<br>
		<br>How should we build the Foundation?<br><br>It is to be done by 
		voluntary participation only. It is neither to be an assessment nor a 
		tax, nor are participating members or dubs expected to take upon 
		themselves the slightest burden. It is believed, however, that there are 
		tens of thousands of Rotarians who will look upon this opportunity as a 
		real privilege, men who feel that Rotary has done much for them, who 
		sincerely believe in its purposes and objects. Then there are other men 
		who are seeking ways and means of leaving some part of their wealth 
		where it may do the greatest good for humanity. What better equipped 
		organization or institution than Rotary International can be found to be 
		entrusted with such funds?<br><br>Contributions may be made by outright 
		gifts of cash or property of any kind, or through the channel of life 
		insurance. Also by bequests made in wills. In addition to this, the 
		Rotary Foundation provides pledge certificates of three 
		denominations–$100, $500, $1,000–payable in ten years in annual 
		installments.<br><br>What greater satisfaction could a Rotarian have 
		than to realize that the income from a $100 pledge certificate would pay 
		his per capita tax each year in perpetuity? As one member recently said, 
		&quot;I now can feel that I will be playing a part in Rotary's development 
		and success for centuries to come and long after I am gone.&quot;<br><br>
		<strong>THE 
		LESSON</strong><br><br>MANY years ago when a boy of twelve, I went to visit my 
		grandparents who lived on a farm. On Sunday they took me to the Meetin' 
		House (as they called it) for divine worship, a lovely little white 
		frame church of old New England architecture. The grounds surrounding 
		the edifice were jammed with horses and buggies, two and three seated 
		rigs, and farm wagons. The church was filled.<br><br>I was at once awed 
		by the figure of a tall old man with flowing hair and beard of white, 
		who took charge of everything but the sermon (he allowed the preacher to 
		do that). He passed the hymn books, then sat in the pulpit; he sang the 
		loudest, prayed the longest, and during the sermon kept shouting &quot;Amen!&quot;<br>
		<br>Forty years later in a reminiscent mood I drove by the old farm and 
		by the old church, but the sight was a sad one–doors and windows gone, 
		openings boarded up, front steps decayed and broken, the roof caved in.<br>
		<br>Five years later I again passed this same way. The old church was 
		gone, nothing left to mark the spot. An old farmer, leaning on his hoe, 
		came hobbling along.<br><br>&quot;Stranger, can you tell me what happened to 
		the old church?&quot; said I.<br><br>Looking up and wiping his eyes to see 
		who was speaking, he cleared his throat and then replied, &quot;Yes sir, my 
		friend, I know all about it. You see, the old church was a purty lively 
		place for many years, two services on Sunday and Sunday school, 
		Christmas trees, summer picnics, and all that sort of thing—it was the 
		life of this whole section. But in late years we come to have too many 
		deacons, sittin' in the front rows, coin' all the speakin' and shoutin', 
		and too few reg'lar folks in the back pews who occasionally put a nickel 
		in the plate. The old preacher died, some said of starvation. Wasn't 
		enough money to hire a new one, so the old church had to close up and 
		now it's gone, all–(here he choked up but finally continued) gone.&quot;<br>
		<br>Pulling himself together and leaning heavily on his hoe, the old 
		farmer wearily continued on his way.<br><br>I am often reminded of the 
		lesson contained in the old man's words.</td>
