		SOME ANNIVERSARY MONTH RECOLLECTIONS<br>BY THE MOVEMENT'S FIRST

		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">TO STOP and look back into the 
		past in these days when all eyes are focused anxiously on the future 
		reminds me of a yarn Paul Harris liked to tell. The story concerned a 
		strange bird that always flew backward because he didn't care where he 
		was going, but he certainly wanted to see where he'd been.<br><br>None 
		of us wants to fly backward. Few of us groan for the past. Still, there 
		are certain values in taking an occasional backward glance for, as our 
		old friend and Founder Paul well knew, &quot;What is past is prologue.&quot; Now 
		in February, as our 7,191 Clubs celebrate Rotary's 46th birthday, is a 
		fitting time to look at some of the events of yesterday that shaped the 
		world wide fellowship we know today. With your indulgence, my fellow 
		Rotarian,<br><br>I shall dip into my store of memories to illustrate 
		them.<br><br>One day in August of 1911, 149 men from various parts of 
		the United States dropped their work and caught trains for Portland, 
		Oregon for the second Annual Convention of the National Association of 
		Rotary Clubs. I was privileged to be one of them, having helped to start 
		our Club in Philadelphia just a year before. Since its founding in 
		Chicago in 1905, Rotary had sprung up in 30 of the largest U. S. cities, 
		and in Portland it was trying to find itself. I was fascinated to hear 
		earnest fellows from Minneapolis, Seattle, San Francisco, and other 
		places expound their views on what Rotary was, how far a Club should go 
		in civic service, how to explain Rotary to the public.<br><br>The climax 
		of that small reunion had overtones that ring to this day. It came when 
		President Paul, presiding, read a message from a Chicago Rotarian named 
		Arthur Frederick Sheldon, a business school founder. The message ended 
		with the words &quot;He profits most who serves best.&quot;<br><br>Instantly the 
		words made a &quot;hit&quot; and when the Convention adopted a Rotary Platform, 
		they appeared as the final words in it. Brief in its language but broad 
		in its meaning, the phrase has stood the test of time as a concise 
		expression of Rotary fundamentals. For 39 years it served as a motto 
		available to Rotarians. Just last Summer in Detroit Rotarians of the 
		world in their 41st Convention made it, along with &quot;Service above Self,&quot; 
		a Rotary Motto.<br><br>Another surprise, with meaning for the years to 
		come, awaited us in Duluth, Minnesota, where our growing Rotary family 
		held its third annual gathering. To our joy we found a delegation of 
		five Rotarians from Canada present. They represented the new Rotary Club 
		of Winnipeg, and Santa Claus and his reindeer could not have been more 
		welcome. So then and there, with Clubs also formed in Britain and 
		Ireland, we changed our name to the International Association of Rotary 
		Clubs, which later was shortened to Rotary International. Duluth saw the 
		beginning of one of the most inspirational elements in Rotary the great 
		annual friendly gatherings of Rotarians and their wives and children 
		from many, many lands. If you will be in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for 
		Rotary's 42d Annual Convention May 27 31, you will see what I mean.<br>
		<br>What were Rotarians talking and thinking about with respect to 
		Rotary in those days &quot;way back then&quot;? Some were saying that Rotary could 
		not thrive in a city of less than 20,000. felt that it could not 
		flourish outside of the Anglo Saxon world. Time and events have of 
		course proved both views in error. On every hand Rotarians continued 
		their groping for the true meaning of this Rotary and, indeed, in 1914 
		they set up a &quot;Committee on Philosophy and Education&quot; to gather the best 
		thinking of Rotarians everywhere on the subject and then to &quot;write down 
		Rotary.&quot; I was honored to serve with that Committee and I recall with a 
		great pride in my fellow Rotarians of that day the vast outpouring of 
		earnest thought they addressed to US.<br><br>(The philosophy of Rotary, 
		suggested by Paul Harris, in 1915, has yet to be created in 2005 ed.)<br>
		<br>THE FUTURE HISTORIAN of Rotary will conclude, I am certain, that the 
		foundations of the movement were planned and laid with the utmost care.<br>
		<br>But my love of Rotary, as I knew it then, is second to my hopes for 
		it for tomorrow. I can do no better than to echo words my dear late 
		friend Paul Harris spoke in 1912 as he stepped down from the Presidency: 
		&quot;The grandeur of Rotary is in its future, not in its past. This is the 
		matin not the vespers, of Rotary. The call for ... conscience responsive 
		thought has never been more insistent since the birth of Rotary than at 
		the present day. Men will arise to the call . . .”.<br><br>THE 
		ROTARIAN, February 1951<br><br>Submitted by archivist Dr. Wolfgang 
		Ziegler 16 February 2005</td>
