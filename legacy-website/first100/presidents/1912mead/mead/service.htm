        <span style="font-family: Arial"><style="font-size: 9pt">THE CONCISE OXFORD 
        Dictionary defines Rotary as “a United States and British society with 
        many branches for international service to humanity, originally named 
        from clubs entertaining in rotation.” When the writer took exception to 
        this definition he was informed by the editor that friends and critics 
        of Rotary gave such varying descriptions of it that definition became 
        difficult. We will all agree to that and no definition of Rotary will be 
        undertaken here.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <span style="font-family: Arial"><style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <span style="font-family: Arial"><style="font-size: 9pt">At the time this 
        Dictionary was published, however, there were at least fifty different 
        countries represented in Rotary and therefore geographically the 
        definition was one twenty-fifth right; it was almost as far off from 
        accuracy in its attempt to indicate the purpose of Rotary.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <span style="font-family: Arial"><style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <span style="font-family: Arial"><style="font-size: 9pt">There is no finer word 
        in any language than “Service” and none that expresses a nobler 
        sentiment, but it has been overworked ad nauseam and commercialized 
        right and left. When a word or idea of [this kind becomes common and is 
        lightly used, the effect is to cheapen it and deprive it of its 
        character and appeal. Was it Madame Roland who exclaimed “O Liberty, 
        what crimes are committed in thy name!” So might a Rotarian or Kiwanian 
        lament, “O Service, what folly and pretense are oft-times put forward in 
        thy name!”</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">

        <p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <span style="font-family: Arial"><style="font-size: 9pt">Obviously the basic idea 
        in Rotary's two slogans is Service of some kind. The first one came 
        early from that philosopher of business, Arthur Sheldon—”He profits most 
        who serves best.” It may be that at the time Dr. Sheldon was thinking of 
        business profit; at any rate from time to time high-minded Rotarians 
        have feared that implication and the shorter motto of “<a href="../../../leaders/collins/index.htm">Service Above 
        Self</a>” put in its appearance. I quite agree with our British friends that 
        one slogan is enough and that to wave two of them is overdoing matters. 
        It is deeds not slogans that count. Rotary has been so sincere and 
        effective on the practical side of its idealism that if there ever was a 
        danger of frittering away its opportunities in formulating the ritual of 
        a Service cult, that danger has long since passed.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <span style="font-family: Arial"><style="font-size: 9pt">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <span style="font-family: Arial"><style="font-size: 9pt">First of all it is our 
        duty to understand just what kind of Service Rotary was organized and 
        created to perform and then hew to the line. Our obligation is a 
        particularly heavy one because other organizations have picked up the 
        trail that we blazed—Kiwanis, Lions, and the rest, and all are known, at 
        least in the United States and Canada, as “Service Clubs.” They will no 
        doubt continue to be influenced and guided by Rotary as long as its 
        premiership is characterized by intelligence, sincerity and courage.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">

        <p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <span style="font-family: Arial"><style="font-size: 9pt">What then is Rotary 
        Service as distinguished from the innumerable other kinds of Service 
        that we hear about? Unquestionably it is Service in the business field, 
        the field with which Rotarians are best acquainted and in which they are 
        preeminent. Somebody will say that such a conclusion is wrung from us by 
        the tortures of these hard times when unemployment, suffering, and 
        endless worry cry out for relief. But the record tells its own story and 
        shows plainly enough that Rotary was a business men's organization from 
        the first, has always remained such, and is such today the whole world 
        over in 3,641 clubs and some seventy countries.</font></span></p>

        <span style="font-family: Arial"><style="font-size: 9pt">PREVIOUS to the first 
        convention in Chicago in 1910, the sixteen original clubs had been 
        dealing with local business problems; and when they became united in the 
        National Association of Rotary Clubs, they broadened their outlook to 
        meet the national aspect of similar problems. Of the present familiar 
        six objects of Rotary, five deal with business wholly or in part. 
        Business is the keystone of the Rotary arch and the realm of its 
        activities. For example, Old Number One Club of Chicago with its 
        membership of over six hundred held a Great Business Recovery Exposition 
        covering 30,000 square feet of floor space in the Hotel Sherman, 
        attended, it was reported, by 50,000 people, in January of this year. 
        Over and over again it has been said that a Rotary club is a horizontal 
        section of the business community in which it exists.</span></p>

        industrial age the welfare of the people depends upon business; we have 
        all learned that in the last four years if we did not know it before. 
        Men have cried out for work more than for bread or clothing. Rotary 
        recognized this fact from the beginning. In the second year of its 
        existence as an association (1911), the Portland convention adopted the 
        Rotary platform whose opening paragraph, in substance, says: Recognizing the 
        commercial basis of modern life as a necessary incident to human 
        evolution, the Rotary club is organized to express that proper relation 
        between private interests and the fusion of private interests which

        <span style="font-family: Arial"><style="font-size: 9pt">Paragraph four of this

        <span style="font-family: Arial"><style="font-size: 9pt">It would appear from the 
        revelations of the last four years that this demand was a large order. 
        But Rotary made good and redeemed its pledge. From 1922 to 1931 there 
        were 157 written “Codes of Correct Practice” adopted by trade and 
        business associations in the United States and elsewhere, largely as the 
        result of the efforts of Rotarian members. Rotary sensed the needs of 
        the age with unerring judgment and foresight.</font></span></p>
