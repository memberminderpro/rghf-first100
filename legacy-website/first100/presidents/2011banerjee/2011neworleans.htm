		morning and namaskar, as we say in India.<br><br>Standing up here before 
		all of you is without a doubt one of the most incredible moments I have 
		had in Rotary. To see all of you, so many people, my brothers and 
		sisters of Rotary, from so many nations, gathered here in New Orleans 
		under the flag of Rotary, is simply amazing. And to have the call to 
		serve as the first among equals in this great organization in the coming 
		Rotary year is also a truly humbling experience.<br><br>Some time back, 
		we had a phone call from our granddaughter Tia, who lives in Australia 
		and whom you met just a little while ago. Every week, she and her 
		friends have to tell in school about what is going on at home with their 
		families. Well, apparently when it came her turn to share the family 
		update sometime back, she put up her hand and said, &#8213;My grandpa is going 
		to be the president of the world.<br><br>Strangely enough, her teacher 
		had a hard time believing that. She said, &#8213;He’s going to be what? And 
		little Tia absolutely insisted. She said, &#8213;He’s going to be president of 
		the world. I know, because my mummy told me so. Well, Tia’s teacher 
		phoned up the mother, and after what had happened was explained, peace 
		and calm returned. But today, whenever Tia meets up with me, she can’t 
		resist saying, with her mischievously sweet smile: &#8213;Hello, President of 
		the World.<br><br>You know, coming into this assignment in Rotary right 
		now, I can tell you that our President Ray, our own Rotary cowboy, is 
		going to be a tough, tough act to follow. But today at least I’ve got 
		the advantage, I think, because if there is anything bigger, better, and 
		bolder than a cowboy, it is a cowboy and an Indian together.<br><br>And 
		here in New Orleans, we’ve got a lot of history, and even a lot of 
		Rotary history as well. As I was preparing my remarks, I had a look at 
		the proceedings of the last RI Convention held here, in 1976, when 
		Ernesto Imbassahy de Mello of Brazil was the president of Rotary and 
		Gerald Ford was president of America, which was celebrating its 
		bicentennial. President Ford, who was himself a Rotarian, was to come to 
		address the convention, but at the last moment he had to drop out and be 
		replaced by another speaker, who quoted a valedictory speech given by a 
		young lady at a Mississippi high school, who had said: &#8213;The trouble in 
		America today is not so much the noise of the bad as the silence of the 
		good.&#8214;<br>Well, speaking from a perspective of more than 34 years down 
		the line and also of a somewhat different culture to that of the young 
		lady at the high school, I would agree that it is a problem, but I would 
		not call it a problem that is peculiar to the United States. It’s true, 
		really, all around the world, that we hear much more about what is wrong 
		with the world than about what is right. We notice much more the people 
		who don’t care than the people who do. The people who create trouble 
		rather than the people who get things right.<br><br>But here in New 
		Orleans today, we have abundant evidence that there are people who do 
		care — people who are doing what is right — people who are doing good. 
		And let me tell you, the good that you are doing in this world of ours 
		is making a difference.<br>Let me ask you, if I may: Why are we here 
		today? Indeed, why are we all in Rotary? I believe we are here because 
		we care, and because we see both what’s wrong in the world, and what’s 
		right. And we want to carry forward what’s good, build on it, expand on 
		it, help it grow — while taking a hard look at what needs to be changed 
		in our lives and then doing what we can to change it.<br>Because at its 
		core, I think, Rotary is about change. It’s about not being content with 
		things as they are. It’s about not going gently into that good night.<br>
		<br>A man named David Selbourne, a British social commentator and 
		historian, wrote a little book called Moral Evasion. And in it, he 
		listed 11 reasons why people avoid making moral judgments, why they 
		avoid looking at something and saying, this is not right and we must do 
		something about it. That sounds familiar, doesn’t it? Let me recount a 
		few of those reasons:<br>&#8213;There is no quick fix.<br>&#8213;There is nothing 
		you can do about it.<br>&#8213;The problem is much more complex than you 
		think.<br>&#8213;You are focusing on the wrong issue.<br>&#8213;It has never been 
		any different.<br>And, of course, the perennial, &#8213;Who are you to talk?<br>
		<br>Well, who indeed are we to talk?<br>Who are we? We are Rotarians.<br>
		<br>We are the doers of our communities, the leaders, the ones who are 
		most involved, who see the problems and have the means to find the 
		solutions. As our strategic plan so elegantly and aptly defines it: We 
		are a worldwide network of inspired individuals who translate their 
		passions into relevant social causes to change lives in communities.<br>
		<br>I’m fond of quoting Mahatma Gandhi, who said, &#8213;You must be the 
		change you wish to see in the world. I believe we are in Rotary to 
		change the world — for why else would we be Rotarians?<br><br>We are not 
		here to listen to the naysayers, the doom-mongers, those who say the 
		world can be no better than it is, so why even try to change? We are 
		here because we believe in change. And let me tell you, my brothers and 
		sisters — that change, any real change, has to come from us, starting 
		from within us, from inside each one of us.<br><br>Because, if what we 
		want is a world with more kindness, more caring, more joy, and more love 
		— well, if we want all of those things in our world, we have to put them 
		there! &#8213;Where do we find those things? you ask. Well, I believe we will 
		find them by looking within ourselves. That’s where the search begins.<br>
		In order to achieve anything in this world, a person has to use all the 
		resources he or she can draw on. And the only place to start is with 
		ourselves and within ourselves. And the questions we need to ask 
		ourselves are: Why am I here? Why are you here? I believe it is because 
		we all seek a sense of fulfillment in our lives, and to achieve that 
		fulfillment, we have to find harmony between our inner self and the 
		outer self. The inner dimension is our desires, our will, our spirit — 
		and our outer dimension is the action we take and the image we create. 
		That is why I am asking you to reach within and unleash your inner power 
		and then use it to embrace everything and everyone around you.<br><br>Go 
		ahead: First reach within yourself, and then move on — confidently, 
		firmly — toward the targets you have set for yourselves. Discover 
		yourself, develop the strengths within you, and then, unhesitatingly, 
		unflinchingly, go forth and encircle the world, to embrace humanity. And 
		that, my brothers and sisters in Rotary, is going to be our theme for 
		the coming year: Reach Within to Embrace Humanity.<br><br>How we do this 
		will vary, club to club, culture to culture, country to country. Each of 
		you knows best what your own community needs. But together, around the 
		world, we Rotarians will be guided by three emphases: the family, 
		continuity, and change.<br><br>Our first emphasis will be the family. It 
		is our first emphasis because the family is the beginning, the starting 
		point for everything we are trying to accomplish.<br><br>The family is 
		the building block of the community, and as the family goes, so goes the 
		nation. If we wish to see a world that is more joyous, we first have to 
		make sure that the families of the world are more joyous, that they have 
		the things they need to be happy, to thrive, and move forward. So we 
		have to look at housing, at clean water and sanitation, at health care, 
		at all the issues affecting mothers and children.<br>For there to be a 
		strong family, there must first be a strong and safe home — only then 
		can there be health, hope, and harmony within its walls. Indeed, a home 
		is where the family begins.<br><br>Back in the year 2001, the state of 
		Gujarat in India, where I come from, had a terrible earthquake, 
		measuring 7.2 on the Richter scale. It occurred on the morning of the 
		26th of January, the day India celebrates its Republic Day, and at a 
		time when children are usually at their schools, participating in 
		ceremonial flag hoisting and march pasts. Well, the severity of the 
		quake destroyed many towns and killed thousands, many of them 
		schoolchildren attending the morning’s ceremonies.<br><br>One day later, 
		I rushed there from Mumbai, 1,100 km away, and visited Anjar, one of the 
		towns worst hit. And as I sat there with the shaken Rotarians, all of 
		them fortunately alive and safe, working out how best we could help 
		people rebuild their homes, in walked a lady — perhaps 65 years of age, 
		carrying a small cloth bundle — who said: &#8213;I hear you Rotarians are 
		planning to rebuild our homes. Well, I have here some money; please use 
		it if you can.&#8214; We opened her bundle and counted out 120,000 rupees — 
		that’s about US$2,500 — and thanked her for it. She just said: &#8213;Just use 
		it up. And I’ll try and give you more.<br><br>Four months later, we had 
		the shelters ready — 200 of them built with all the money we had put 
		together. Indeed, much help poured in, from Rotary clubs in Japan, today 
		sadly damaged and recovering from its own quake and tsunami disaster; 
		from the USA; and also from Italy and other parts of the world. The 
		homes were modest but adequate, and as we organized a simple handing 
		over, suddenly there came up from amongst the crowd the lady who had 
		given us her savings. She came up and said: &#8213;My brothers and sisters, I 
		want to tell you how happy I am today, and I want to thank you 
		Rotarians. You see, I have lived in Anjar all my life with my family. 
		Two years ago, my son and his wife were killed in a bus accident. But I 
		survived the catastrophe, only because of Munni, my granddaughter, who 
		was the light of my life. And then, on the 26th of January, Munni went 
		to her school and never came back. I was devastated. But then, when I 
		heard that you Rotarians were rebuilding our town, I gave you whatever I 
		had saved for going on the Hajj for pilgrimage. After Munni went, I 
		didn’t want to go on the Hajj anymore. And today, you have given me back 
		what I lost with Munni. I don’t need to go to Mecca now. My Mecca is 
		right here. And then she broke down and wept, and I must confess, so did 
		we.<br>And so, that’s why I say a home is where the family begins.<br>
		<br>Our second emphasis will be on continuity, on continuing and 
		strengthening those things we do well. There are so many areas in which 
		we have been successful — working for clean, safe water; spreading 
		literacy; working in so many ways with Generation Next, our youth. And 
		of course, our greatest project, polio eradication — where our success 
		has come slowly, but is no less certain.<br><br>As the saying goes, the 
		difficult is done immediately; the impossible takes a little longer. If 
		we want to really achieve the impossible, we have to have not only 
		persistence, but vision — we have to be looking past what we are doing 
		now, at what we can and should be doing in the days and years to come.<br>
		<br>And so, our third emphasis in 2011-12 will be change, and we start 
		by being the change we wish to see in the world. If we wish for peace, 
		we start by living in peace ourselves, in our homes and in our 
		communities. If we wish environmental degradation to stop, if we wish to 
		reduce child mortality or to prevent hunger, we must be the instrument 
		of that change — and to recognize that it must start within each of us.<br>
		<br>And to bring about these changes, we will need to think in new and 
		different ways, explore new ways of seeing. If we do what we have always 
		done, we will get what we have always got — nothing better, nothing 
		more. This would not satisfy us professionally, and it certainly should 
		not satisfy us in our Rotary service, where the stakes are so much 
		higher.<br><br>Past RI President Bill Huntley used to tell the story of 
		the old woodcutter who passed on his much-used ax to his son before 
		retiring, saying: &#8213;Son, this is the ax that our family has used for 
		generations. And except for eight new handles and 12 new blades, it is 
		the same ax I and your forefathers have always used. It is now yours.<br>
		<br>Rotary is a bit like that, isn’t it? As we explore Generation Next 
		in our new fifth Avenue of Service, as we focus on our strategic plan 
		and Future Vision, I believe it is time for us to move into a 
		future-forward mode — not just in the next year but in the next decade 
		and beyond. These are exciting times, changing times, and times when we 
		keep our feet firmly on the ground, anchored in our core values, but 
		look beyond the far horizon. And as our Generation Next connects through 
		Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and iPhones, I believe the time has come to 
		join hands, urge them forward, and go ahead developing our own Rotary 
		social network, as we hope to do in the coming months.<br><br>Yes, my 
		brothers and sisters in Rotary, the time has come for us to change — 
		change from our pallor of gray and go green, to embrace our new 
		generation of newer, younger members. They are all out there waiting to 
		come in, and we need to open our doors and give them space. And I don’t 
		know how you feel, but I have always believed that the younger 
		generation of today is perhaps more committed to the ideas of service 
		and friendship than many of us were at that age. And we must understand 
		the reality of the new generation of Rotary and help them balance 
		expectations with realities. They are under pressure constantly, being 
		involved in multiple endeavors, and yet have a strong work-life balance. 
		And I understand too that even though they may be constantly on call 
		with their careers and managing multiple responsibilities, they are as 
		dedicated and passionate about being a Rotarian as you and I are.<br>
		<br>On a recent visit to Myanmar to look at the possibility of Rotary’s 
		return to that lovely country, I was out dining with a local person from 
		big business. And he told me about his son who had done his MBA at a top 
		university here in the USA, got himself a job with a five-figure salary, 
		but after two years gave it up to join an NGO [nongovernmental 
		organization] engaged in spreading literacy in countries in South Asia, 
		with a 75 percent salary cut — but a 100 percent enhancement of job 
		satisfaction. Oh yes, they are all there, future and potential 
		Rotarians, but we have to tell them our story, the story of Rotary. We 
		need to work harder on our public image, we need to tell them who we 
		are, what we do, and what we stand for. And the time to do it is now.<br>
		<br>Let me ask you a question: What does each one of us seek in life? I 
		bet the word is happiness. Now let me ask you: Could Rotary be the 
		source for that happiness? The law of duality affects human lives, yours 
		and mine: Where there is joy, there is sorrow; with positive, we see 
		negative; with heat, there is cold; with light, there is darkness. Yes, 
		with love, there is hatred. Only if we could find a balance, we could 
		probably seek the emotional<br>situation that we call happiness. I 
		submit that this equilibrium is present within each one of us. As a 
		well-known Sufi poet and scholar in the 13th century said: &#8213;Inside me 
		there is good news. Others look for good news outside themselves.&#8214; There 
		dwells within you the power and the spirit that can evoke the energy 
		that you may not realize. You have to reach that inner voice, and you 
		can do so provided you have the hunger for it. You have to be hungry 
		enough to reach within and release the energy which will help you 
		embrace humanity. I believe this is the state, the equilibrium, we call 
		happiness. And I have just given you the prescription for it. Rotary can 
		help you achieve the happiness in life that you seek.<br>I had started 
		this morning by referring to a speaker at the last convention in New 
		Orleans, and I would like to close today by remembering something he 
		said that morning, because that’s the way I feel too. My fondest wish 
		for you, he said, is that at the end of the day, each day, you can look 
		back and think: &#8213;I wrote a little line today in the history of good. 
		Some days, you might write a paragraph in the history of good. There 
		might be a day once when you could write a whole chapter in the history 
		of good. I think that’s what motivates Rotary. I think that is indeed 
		what motivates men and women of goodwill every place on the face of the 
		earth.<br><br>Indeed it does. And so, as you go back from this 
		convention, perhaps today, maybe tomorrow, as you go back to your homes 
		and to the countries you have come from, as you go back to Japan, as you 
		go back to England, as you go back to India, as you go back to Brazil, 
		and as you go back to South Africa and Australia and all the other great 
		countries of the world of Rotary, go and tell your clubs and your 
		communities that you are ready to take on the challenges that face us 
		today, the challenges of distrust, of fear, of intolerance, of 
		helplessness, of violence, and that the Rotarians are ready to go and 
		work – with hope, with enthusiasm, with courage, and with vision – and 
		to stand firm and strong and tall like Mount Everest, firm in our 
		purpose to spread love and happiness and to work for peace.<br><br>My 
		wife, Binota, and I look forward to the privilege of joining hands with 
		each one of you as you Reach Within to Embrace Humanity, and continue to 
		write the history of the good.<br><br>Thank you.</td>
