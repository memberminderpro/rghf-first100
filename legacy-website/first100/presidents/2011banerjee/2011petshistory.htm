				<img alt="Banerjee" height="200" src="images/banerjee.jpg" style="float: left" width="161">My 
				brothers and sisters in Rotary—good morning/afternoon/evening. 
				You know, we Rotarians, we talk a lot. We spend a lot of our 
				time talking. Whenever you go to a club meeting or a training 
				session or a district conference, I think it is safe to say that 
				you will not escape listening to a speech or even a few dozen 
				speeches. And if you’re in Rotary for any length of time 
				whatsoever, it is pretty much a given that you will be asked 
				sooner or later to give one yourself. And then you have the 
				humbling experience of spending hours putting together a gem of 
				oratory, polishing it to perfection in front of your bathroom 
				mirror, striding out onto the lectern full of confidence and 
				enthusiasm, and then watching your audience nod off somewhere 
				around paragraph number two. <br><br>Well, I’ve been a Rotarian 
				for quite a long time and I don’t want to think too much about 
				how many people I’ve put to sleep over all those years. But one 
				of the really great things about speaking to a group of Rotary 
				club presidents-elect is that you know that nobody there is 
				going to be falling asleep. Because all of you know that you’re 
				here for a reason. You’re here to learn how to be a Rotary club 
				president. And not just that. You’re here to learn how to be the 
				president of a great Rotary club—to build a stronger Rotary, a 
				stronger community, a better future for all of us. <br>We’re 
				here in Rotary for simple reasons, really. To help each other. 
				To do what we can. To try to increase, a little bit, the amount 
				of kindness and love and caring in the world. And none of us can 
				really know, today, just what the repercussions will be, down 
				the road, of the things we do. But I do believe absolutely that 
				what goes around comes around. <br><br>When we do good things 
				for other people, it doesn’t end with them. The effects ripple 
				on and on, and you’d be surprised how far. Well, those of you 
				who know me already know how much I love a good story, and today 
				I’d like to tell you one about a student at Stanford University, 
				in California, back in 1892. A poor but enterprising student 
				there decided to arrange a concert at the university by 
				world-famous Polish pianist Ignacy Paderewski. It’s a little 
				hard to imagine now, but back then, Paderewski was like Elvis, 
				so it seemed that the project couldn’t lose. It did, however—the 
				student was a good engineer, but a bad publicist, and he made 
				one grave mistake: he neglected to advertise the concert. And of 
				course, this meant no one showed up—but he still owed Paderewski 
				his fee, along with the fees for the concert hall and so on. 
				Well, of course the poor student was horrified when he realized, 
				and asked Paderewski not to play, since he couldn’t be paid. But 
				Paderewski did play, and when he had it explained to him what 
				had happened, he took pity on the poor fellow and paid the 
				concert’s bills out of his own pocket. Seventeen years later, 
				Paderewski became prime minister of Poland, in one of the worst 
				periods of Polish history, a time of terrible suffering and 
				famine. <br><br>And it was fortunate indeed for him that the 
				young man he had helped was named Herbert Hoover—and he had gone 
				on to become President of the United States. And Hoover had not 
				forgotten. When he visited Warsaw, he was met by twenty-five 
				thousand children, who had come to greet him—nearly all of them 
				barefoot. Within hours he telegraphed for help and 700,000 
				overcoats and 700,000 pairs of shoes were shipped to Poland 
				before the onset of winter. Another half million coats and shoes 
				were delivered in the following two years. By 1922, half a 
				billion meals had been provided, feeding two million people out 
				of ten thousand kitchens, all with food and equipment provided 
				by the Americans. And all of this happened because of the orders 
				of one American—who had not forgotten the kindness shown to him 
				by one Pole so many years before. Now Hoover was a great 
				humanitarian, and an orphan who felt deeply the suffering of 
				children. Perhaps he would have done it anyway. But one cannot 
				know. <br>One can never know where the good one does will 
				reach—we can only know that we should never miss a chance to do 
				another soul a kindness. <br><br>Nobody else is going to do it 
				for us. If we want there to be kindness in the world, we have to 
				put it there. Now, if we talk about caring for others, caring 
				for the world, usually you would understand this to mean that we 
				must look outward, toward others. But I, perhaps with my own 
				Indian perspective, see it differently. I would say to you that 
				if you want to care for others truly, fully, from your heart, 
				and in a way that will really make a difference—well, you have 
				to start with your own heart. You have to start by reaching 
				within yourself to find the strength and the love that you have, 
				and then bring that strength and love outward to share it with 
				others. And that is why our theme for the next Rotary year will 
				be, Reach within to Embrace Humanity. How will we do this? Well, 
				we will be guided by three emphases: the family; continuity; and 
				change. Our first emphasis will be the family, because the 
				family is where all our goals begin. If we wish to see a world 
				that is more joyous—we first have to make sure that the families 
				of the world are more joyous, that they have the things they 
				need to thrive and move forward. <br><br>Years ago, I had had 
				the privilege to work with Mother Teresa of Calcutta and I 
				remember her saying: at the end of our lives we’ll be judged not 
				by how many diplomas we have received, how much money we have 
				made, or how many great things we have done. We will be judged 
				by: I was hungry, you gave me to eat, I was naked and you 
				clothed me. I was homeless and you took me in. And it was Mother 
				Teresa who said: the world is upside down and is suffering so 
				much because there is so little love in the home and in the 
				family life. Love begins at home – love lives in homes. In the 
				home, begins the disruption of the peace of the world. And this 
				is why I tell you today that it is in the home that we must 
				begin to work to rebuild that peace. <br><br>The family is the 
				building block of the community, and as the family goes, so goes 
				the nation. So we have to look at housing, at clean water and 
				sanitation, at health care, at all the issues affecting mothers 
				and children. For there to be a strong family there must first 
				be a strong and safe home—only then can there be health, hope, 
				and harmony within its walls. Our second emphasis will be on 
				continuity, on continuing and strengthening those things we do 
				well. <br><br>There are so many areas in which we have been 
				successful--working for clean, safe water; spreading literacy; 
				working in so many ways with the GeneratioNext, our youth. And 
				of course, our greatest project, polio eradication—where our 
				success has come slowly, but is no less certain. As the saying 
				goes, the difficult is done immediately—the impossible takes a 
				little longer. If we want to really achieve the impossible, we 
				have to keep at it—this is why I ask you to focus in your 
				service on continuing the things we do best. Then, of course 
				there are always things that we can do better, things that we 
				should be changing, and things that we haven’t started working 
				on yet. <br> <br>I believe we must have the wisdom and courage to see 
				these and identify them and engage ourselves in them. And so, 
				our third emphasis in 2011-12 will be change; and we start by 
				being the change we wish to see in the world. If we wish 
				environmental degradation to stop, if we wish to reduce child 
				mortality or to prevent hunger, we must be the instrument of 
				that change – and recognize that it must start within us, with 
				each of us. And to bring about these changes, we will need to 
				think in new and different ways, explore new ways of seeing. I 
				think it is a great thing for all of Rotary that we now have a 
				fifth avenue of service, the avenue of service to the new 
				generations. And this I think is something that absolutely every 
				single club has to be looking at—it needs to be something right 
				along with our other avenues of service, and every bit as 
				important as vocational service, international service and so 
				on. We have to be open to change here. We have to look at what 
				we are doing, why it’s not working, and how we can make it work 
				better. <br><br>How can we be more attractive to younger 
				members, who are so different in so many ways to the young 
				professionals of a generation or two ago? Because it really is a 
				challenge. Young professionals today, young businesspeople, they 
				are much more pressured than before. They aren’t able to take a 
				few hours out in the middle of the day for a lunch meeting. They 
				are working longer hours, spending much less time at home, and 
				every minute they have is precious. We have to show them that 
				Rotary is a good use of their time, a valuable use of their 
				time—something that will enrich their lives, deepen the meaning 
				of their days, something that they will want to be a part of. 
				And we have to come to them where they are—and for most young 
				people, where they are is on the Internet, on Facebook, on 
				Twitter and email and their Blackberries. A club that doesn’t 
				have a presence on the Internet simply doesn’t exist so far as 
				they are concerned. More than ever before, a club’s web page is 
				its public face—and it has to be a good one. And let’s look 
				ahead a little more, at the people who aren’t ready to be 
				Rotarians yet but will be one day—the Rotaractors, the 
				Interactors, the Youth Exchange participants and Ambassadorial 
				scholars. Every club should be sponsoring a Rotaract or Interact 
				club, every club should be involved in youth programs in some 
				way. And every one of us needs to stay in touch with these young 
				people, bring them in, mentor them. <br><br>I think we need to 
				bring back the idea of the Family of Rotary—the idea that we 
				have to look at our organization as we would look at a family, 
				with its generations and its branches and its responsibilities 
				for each other. A strong family, a bonded and joined family, 
				this is one in which the generations are comfortable together, 
				they get along together, they recognize that they all need each 
				other. And so it should be in Rotary. Why are we spending the 
				majority of our effort looking outside of our Rotary family, 
				trying to bring in new members to older generations, who might 
				be reluctant—when we have an enthusiastic and able younger 
				generation already, in our Rotaractors and Interactors? And so I 
				say we need to be bringing people in on that ground level, that 
				youngest generation, and then keeping them in the family. 
				Retention has to be not just for Rotarians, but for the entire 
				Rotary family. [pause] At the end of the day, why are we all in 
				Rotary? It’s because we love it, and it’s as simple as that. We 
				love the experience we have in Rotary—the fellowship, the 
				friendship, the good feeling we get from helping others, the 
				feeling that we are making things better, the feeling that we 
				are being useful. And these positive feelings are the things we 
				need to work on, to help build, to help strengthen for others. 
				understand that each one of us has a part to play, to perform, 
				to deliver. We cannot simply go back home from here saying, we 
				shall try our best. We need to commit ourselves absolutely, 
				fully, and say what I must do, shall indeed be done. And I tell 
				you, that each one of you will succeed because the resolve and 
				strength to do this- to do anything- comes within yourselves. 
				And so, I say today, first reach within yourself and move on 
				confidently, firmly, towards the targets you have set for 
				yourselves. Because the world needs Rotary, now more than ever.
				<br><br>Thank you. <br>Kalyan Banerjee District 7890 PETS 2011</td>
