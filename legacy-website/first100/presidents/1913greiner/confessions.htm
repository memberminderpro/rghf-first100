		President, Rotary International 1913-1914<br><br>ECHOES–one day last 
		week the clamor of battles of long ago echoed across my desk in the form 
		of a letter from an old Rotary friend.<br><br>“What has happened to 
		politics in Rotary?&quot; he wanted to know. &quot;And what has happened to you, 
		Russ? We hear of duties and services, deeds, accomplishments, agendas 
		and conspectus, plenary sessions and enactments; but where is the old 
		time wire pulling? Where is the skillful manipulation; the pointings 
		with alarm and visionings with pride; the penny-dreadful personalities 
		that used to lead up to the final knock-downs and drag-outs at the 
		annual elections?<br><br>“For a time, Russ, I used to go to conventions 
		serenely certain that I would see you in action. But, apparently, you 
		have faded out and are now just a stodgy businessman talking platitudes 
		about ethics world fellowship—.&quot; The letter is signed &quot;Sam.&quot;<br><br>
		Ho-hum. What a frank relationship is friendship. And it so happens that 
		this letter was from one of the cleverest politicians Rotary ever 
		developed—the only man who was ever elected a director without being at 
		the convention.<br><br>Let me say this to my old friend, &quot;Sam, old 
		quidnunc, you should know that you are talking like the elderly persons 
		who say the winters are warmer than they used to be. Some winters are 
		warm and others are cold, in Rotary and elsewhere.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1913greiner/skeel.gif" style="float: left">“You and I are 
		partners in crime in opposing the ancient hokum of 'let the office seek 
		the man.' We know the office never seeks the man unless a lot of people 
		get together to elect him; and, after all, that is all there is to 
		politics. Let's be honest about it. Yes, Sam, we are both growing old 
		but who is ever too old for a good back-stage fight at a Rotary 
		convention? We may yet see more hard winters.&quot;<br><br>In the meantime, I 
		am taking advantage of the excuse to turn loose a few of the echoes from 
		the explosions behind the stage of conventions—a very few and, because 
		of lack of space, much too briefly. In twenty-three years in Rotary, I 
		have missed only four conventions and have actively participated in 
		thirteen contested campaigns—enough intrigue to fill a thick book.<br>
		<br>Let’s start with my vivid impressions of that Buffalo convention of 
		1913, the year I was elected President. The delegates crowded into a 
		hall at East Aurora, guests of Elbert Hubbard, gazing at the picturesque 
		figure of a man speaking from the raised platform. In the full glory of 
		stage lighting effects and background stood Elbert Hubbard. With the 
		light glistening on his great mane of hair, he looked like a bronze 
		statue. And from his lips came the name of &quot;Russ&quot; Greiner.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1913greiner/hubbard.jpg" style="float: left">No, it 
		was no surprise to me. I knew my friends, who were also friends of 
		Hubbard's, had arranged to have him eulogize me. But I didn't realize a 
		man who had never seen me could speak with such eloquence of my virtues. 
		Yes, it was effective and it was politics.<br><br>My friends left 
		nothing to chance. Lest the delegates forget my name, they had me paged 
		day and night in every hotel housing delegates. No man was ever entirely 
		out of earshot of the bellboys' fog-horn voices, &quot;Paging Mr. Greiner.&quot;<br>
		<br>And then the climax. The news of the convention that year was the 
		British delegation, the first to attend an International Rotary 
		convention. Outstanding among the British was that dominating 
		personality, Charley Dewey, president of a London Insurance Company. We 
		called him &quot;Admiral&quot; Dewey. Who should rise in the convention to 
		nominate me but Dewey. He was greeted with cheers before he said a word. 
		And then he launched out on a marvelous speech. Naturally, we had 
		cultivated his friendship from the first day we arrived in Buffalo.<br>
		<br>SAN FRANCISCO–1915. I mention that convention because it was there I 
		learned two things. The first was the fact that the old political saying 
		about letting the office seek the man can be used to good political 
		purpose. And the other was the danger of impromptu speeches.<br><br>We 
		arrived in San Francisco all on fire to put over our candidate, Arch 
		Klumph, of Cleveland. We had traded favors and made friends for Klumph 
		for weeks preceding the convention. But the minute I walked into his 
		hotel room, I realized the jig was up. The boys on the other side had 
		convinced him it wasn't ethical to seek the office and he refused to 
		run. It took us a year to revise his code of ethics.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/rip-images/16-17klumph.jpg" style="float: left">Ernest 
		Skeel, of Seattle, an outstanding man who had written Rotary's platform 
		of principles, finally permitted us to enter his name. At a great 
		banquet in the Palace Hotel with two thousand people at the tables, 
		Skeel's name was nominated in a speech that was a classic.<br><br>Then 
		up came Skeel, looking around modestly and prepared to speak 
		extemporaneously. With his modesty, he gave out the impression he was 
		refusing the nomination and we had to withdraw his name. We went through 
		with Allen Albert, who was elected.<br><br>WE were always learning 
		something new. The Salt Lake City convention in 1919 was full of 
		dynamite, although most of the delegates went serenely to the vote 
		thinking Bert Adams, of Atlanta, had been uncontested from the start.<br>
		<br>We learned better the day of the opening session, when the best 
		place on the program was given to John Dyer, of Indiana, an impressive 
		looking fellow with a flow of oratory His address was a hit and as we 
		left the session, we found at every door men passing out printed copies 
		of Dyer's speech. He was a formidable candidate. There was a hurried 
		conference with Dyer's backers. &quot;You can't win,&quot; we told them. &quot;Take the 
		vice-presidency.&quot;<br><br>And they did accept the vice presidency without 
		ever knowing how scared we were. In that case, I didn't consider 
		bluffing dishonest.<br><br>That was the fore-runner of the great fight 
		at Atlantic City in 1920, the year our candidate, Frank Harris, was ill 
		in bed at his hotel. Harris was from Illinois, an eminently qualified 
		man who had been offered a cabinet position by President Theodore 
		Roosevelt. Because of his illness, I advised him to withdraw.<br><br>The 
		incident is one of the regrets of my life. Frank refused to withdraw. 
		Until he died a few months later, he thought I had &quot;double-crossed&quot; him. 
		Many times I have left conventions with my friends denouncing me, but in 
		other cases they have lived to understand the situation.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/rip-images/1922havenscu.jpg" style="float: left">For 
		several years before the Los Angeles convention in 1922, the Kansas City 
		club had been grooming my old friend, Ray Havens. We had seen him 
		elected sergeant-at-arms and vice president, by men whose support would 
		elect him president.<br><br>In the Union Station at Kansas City that 
		year, we met a special train of delegates on their way to the 
		convention. Our wide-open grins were all set for their cheers; but, we 
		were met by grim silence.<br><br>&quot;We can't promise our support now,&quot; 
		said a friend and a leader from the south. &quot;See us in Los Angeles.&quot;<br>
		<br>It was a problem of sitting tight. We knew they were in with us too 
		deep to crawl out, and at the end they gave their vote to Ray.<br><br>I 
		well remember that convention for its proof that you can never count a 
		vote until it's voted. A close friend of mine said we were certain of 
		the vote of the whole British delegation. &quot;Just forget them, Russ,&quot; he 
		said. &quot;It's in the bag.&quot;<br><br>But the Britishers found a countryman in 
		Coppock, of lowa. Naturally, as long as they were not actually pledged 
		to us, the British vote went to Coppock.<br><br>FOR plain nerve-wrecking 
		elections, I nominate the Chicago convention of 1930. It started 
		gloriously with our candidate, Almon E. Roth, of Palo Alto, Calif., a 
		strong favorite. Highly educated, young, good-looking, and popular, he 
		was born to be a candidate. But just as we had things under way in 
		Chicago, he was called home due to an accident to his son.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1930roth/roth.gif" style="float: left">There 
		we were, chasing through Chicago hotels in search of delegates while our 
		candidate was two thousand miles away, and no certainty that he would 
		return in time for the vote. It was enough to give a politician nervous 
		indigestion.<br><br>And then came that wonderful telegram, &quot;On my way 
		back to Chicago,” signed &quot;Al.&quot; In the largest ballot ever cast at a 
		Rotary convention, 3335, Roth was an easy victor.<br><br>And so it has 
		gone from year to year, with plenty of trouble and plenty of 
		gratifications. I am happy in the thought that I have never been on a 
		loser. If I have come out of my experiences with a maxim, it is this, 
		&quot;No man ever went anywhere in Rotary politics unless he was honest, both 
		with his own crowd and his opponents.&quot; Whenever I have been against a 
		man he has known it from the start.</td>
