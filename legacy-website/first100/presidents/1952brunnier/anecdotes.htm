	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">In 1908 the second Rotary Club was 
		organized in San Francisco. As a charter member, it has been my good 
		fortune to have been a living part in the growth and development of 
		Rotary International.<br><br>My business and other activities have taken 
		me to many countries around the world and thereby have had many 
		opportunities to visit Rotary Clubs, and my outstanding experience is 
		that I found my membership card a passport to fellowship wherever I 
		visited.<br><br>The following anecdotes are a few of my experiences in 
		visiting Rotary Clubs.<br><br>Here is an experience all speakers 
		occasionally encounter. As District Governor I organized the Fresno 
		Rotary Club and on their 20th anniversary was asked to be the speaker. 
		Their first President was chairman of the day and in presenting me he 
		reminisced for 20 minutes about the early days of their club which left 
		only 10 minutes of my allotted time. In Rotary we always adjourned on 
		time, so I gave a short extemporaneous talk<br><br>Many years ago I 
		attended a District Conference at Little Rock as the representative of 
		the President of Rotary International and was scheduled to speak at the 
		banquet. The District Governor had arranged with a well known local 
		judge, who was not a Rotarian, to be he toastmaster for the evening. 
		After being introduced I was seated beside him. At the time the Maitre 
		d' gave the signal for the waiters to bring in the entrees the judge 
		turned and asked me “who are you and what are you supposed to do?&quot; When 
		I told him that I was the speaker of the evening he replied, &quot;well, 
		might as well put you on now,&quot; and proceeded to announce me to the 
		audience. The dining room was full of columns which obstructed the view 
		for many of the people and the waiters were rattling the dishes and 
		si1verware serving the entrees, and since there was no microphone, the 
		audience except a few close by could not hear me. After five minutes of 
		effort I sat down. There were many apologies later.<br><br>In Rio de 
		Janeiro a fellow Rotarian without my knowledge arranged with the 
		President of the Club for me to sit at the head table. It was the day of 
		the District Governor's visit. The Governor spoke briefly, and since he 
		spoke in Portuguese, I did not know what he was saying but I thought he 
		was a poor speaker or something because the members were conversing and 
		paying little attention to him. When the Governor finished, the 
		President turned to me and asked if I would favor them with a 10 minute 
		talk in English. I was taken completely by surprise but fortunately the 
		reason for my being in their country was something that was of interest 
		to their members so I complied with his request. To my surprise the 
		members paid very little more attention to me than they did to the 
		Governor. As I sat down my friend (?) came over and slapped me on the 
		back and said “Bru, I just wanted to see if you could take it. You see, 
		we prefer to read speeches. Your talk has been translated and all the 
		members will receive a printed copy”.<br><br>On a vacation trip into the 
		ancient Inca Region I found a Rotary Club in Cuzco, Peru, a small 
		community isolated in the mountains at an elevation of 11,000 feet. On 
		attending a meeting of the club I was quite surprised to hear an 
		excellent talk on United Nations given by one of their members. Later 
		when I complimented him he told me that he had never made a talk before 
		and when he accepted the assignment he read everything that he could 
		find on the subject and thereby gained an education that he might never 
		have had.<br><br>Recently, as President of Rotary International, I 
		visited many Rotary Clubs, and a few incidents might be of interest.<br>
		<br>On the occasion of official visit to the Sydney, Australia Rotary 
		Club, the District Governor of that region arranged to have all of his 
		clubs represented by a delegation with their ladies. He wanted my wife 
		and I to meet them all and at a reception prior to the dinner we shook 
		hands with 858 people and, might add, those people really shake hands. 
		As we entered the banquet hall we saw a canvas backdrop for the head 
		table on which there was an 8 ft. picture of myself. Everything is big 
		down there, including their bridge.<br><br>On an official visit in the 
		Philippines the Rotarians arranged an Inter-City luncheon in Baguio. The 
		mayor, a Rotarian, was ill and sent his deputy to the meeting to welcome 
		me. Somehow, the signals got mixed and the deputy spent 20 minutes 
		eulogizing the Knights of Columbus. The District Governor frantically 
		pulled at his coat tail several times but the deputy was on a single 
		track with no terminal facilities.<br><br>A president of Rotary 
		International learns very early in his career that nearly every club 
		would like to have him attend a meeting of their club and later on he 
		finds out that even a past president will frequently be invited.<br><br>
		Recently, on a vacation trip in South Africa, my wife and I motored for 
		22 days from Bulawayo, South Rhodesia to Cape Town. Whenever we stopped 
		in a community that had a Rotary Club the President of the club and his 
		wife would call on us at the hotel and invite us to a special ladies 
		night meeting.<br><br>Evidently the information that a Past President of 
		Rotary International was on the loose was passed along the line. This 
		resulted in my making eleven talks on this trip and I hasten to say that 
		this experience added a great deal to the enjoyment of our holiday and 
		gave us an opportunity to meet and know people in different parts of the 
		Union of South Africa.<br><br>Submitted by<br><br>P. Michael Davies, PE,
