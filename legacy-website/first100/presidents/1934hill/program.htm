		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">By Robert L. Hill<br><br>
		President, Rotary International (1934-1935)<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/rip-images/34-35hill_r.jpg" style="float: left">WE 
		ARE succeeding . . . that all-important fact emerges from the busy week 
		at Detroit. And in that fact there is for us a need of satisfaction and 
		an abiding source of encouragement for the year ahead.<br><br>Rotarians 
		need not be disturbed if newspaper headlines fail to tell of Rotary 
		sponsoring a panacea for the world's economic and social woes. We have 
		none to offer. &quot;Rotary,&quot; as Immediate Past President John Nelson has so 
		appropriately said, &quot;will do well if it continues to tell people how to 
		live; it will come on evil days if it attempts to tell them how to 
		vote.&quot;<br><br>But let no one think that in such a program there is 
		insufficient appeal to enlist the best in busy men. Rotary has come 
		through the past few years with its membership but lightly affected and 
		with a new understanding of its ideal of &quot;service above self.&quot; That 
		concept is being brought to earth and in a thousand ways made a living 
		experience.<br><br>In whatever community you find a Rotary club, there 
		you will find men trained in service, prepared for leadership; and few, 
		if any, of these communities have been disappointed. Rotarians are men 
		who are growing in the knowledge that duty is a thing that is due; that 
		it must be paid by every man who would avoid present discredit and 
		eventual moral insolvency. It is an obligation which can only be 
		discharged by voluntary effort and resolute action; and Rotarians rise 
		to the challenge of &quot;paying their way&quot; as they go.<br><br>That service 
		is the basis of all good business is a prime Rotary tenet, of which the 
		truth is becoming more evident daily. Every transaction has two sides, 
		and it is proper that each benefit. The old doctrine that &quot;business is 
		business,&quot; interpreted to mean &quot;do the other fellow before he does you&quot; 
		is passing—and must if man is to progress. Commerce is getting a new 
		grasp on its fundamentals which revolve about the basic fact of a human 
		need.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/rip-images/33-34nelson.jpg" style="float: left">The 
		clothier whose outlook is touched by vision doesn't merely sell clothes. 
		He dispenses comfort and health and personal satisfaction. The banker 
		doesn't merely rent out money; he is the custodian of a commodity that 
		makes possible factories and farms that employ men and provides the 
		homes in which they live.<br><br>An importer does not just vend sugar 
		and hemp; he is the link that unites people in distant lands, enabling 
		them to use and enjoy products their own economy does not afford. Merely 
		selling things is boredom; selling services is the stuff of which self 
		respect and &quot;dignifying one's vocation&quot; are made.<br><br>
		WORK-PLUS-SERVICE, the Rotary ideal, is the law of our being–the 
		living principle that carries men and nations onward. The greater number 
		of men must labor with their hands, but whether they toil in a shop or 
		at a desk, work properly understood and carefully done is the one way 
		they forge ahead. We have jokingly referred to work as a burden and a 
		chastisement, but we know full well that it is an honor and a glory and 
		that only as the labor of the world is shared shall we untangle those 
		problems that vex and disturb national economies. Without work nothing 
		is achieved. Ali that is great in man comes through it, and civilization 
		is the by-product of it and the leisure it makes possible.<br><br>Rotary 
		lives and will continue to live because it is based on this fundamental 
		of fundamentals. Through Rotary's fellowship and activities runs the 
		common thread of service to fellow men—a service that starts at home 
		and bridges political boundaries. International Service is not just a 
		phrase for Rotarians; with a clarifying perception of its ramifications 
		in community and vocational life, they are striving to integrate mankind 
		in goodwill and understanding.<br><br>Let tribute here be paid to the 
		150,000 Rotarians of many lands who are contributing their effort and 
		their time to the end that the ways of living in the New Day now dawning 
		shall have a prosperity on a much more sound basis than heretofore 
		known. Their self-sacrificing endeavor has made Rotary what it is; their 
		continuing effort and that of men whose interest is enlisted because of 
		their example, augurs for a progressing Rotary in a progressing world.<br>
		<br>University alumni administrator Robert E. Lee &quot;Bob&quot; Hill, of 
		Columbia, Missouri, at midnight on 30 June 1934, attained Rotary's 
		highest office, the international Presidency. This is his unveiling of 
		his program of work for the 1934-1935 Rotary year, and it appeared on 
		page 5 of the July 1934 issue of The Rotarian. Although it is not 
		mentioned in the article above, Hill's motto, or &quot;special emphasis&quot; for 
		the year was Friendship. It was an emphasis so important, the founder of 
		Rotary, Paul Harris, singled it out for special recognition.</td>
