		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">THE 17&#8209;year&#8209;old college orator 
		paused to silhouette his next phrase. &quot;While in pursuit of the 
		glittering gewgaws of pleasure,&quot; he warned, &quot;we are apt to forget the 
		outcome of modern institutions.&quot;<br><br>And even as he spoke, a modern 
		institution over which he himself was to preside 28 years later&#8209;and 
		whose outcome he could never forget&#8209;was taking its first form. The 
		orator was George Caldwell Hager. The institution was the first 
		association of Rotary Clubs. The year&#8209;for the sake of the record&#8209;was 
		1910.<br><br>Yes, today George Hager is President of Rotary 
		International. The fact does not surprise me. To one who has watched his 
		progression in Rotary and in the business world, his election seems but 
		a high point in a logical sequence of events.<br><br>The fact is, folks 
		have always expected George to do things rapidly&#8209;and well&#8209;and to mature 
		speedily on any job. He himself set the pace when he squeezed four years 
		of college work into two and a half, became a high-school principal at 
		18, and won admittance to the bar at 22.<br><br>But perhaps I'm getting 
		ahead of my story. I haven't properly brought George upon the scene. The 
		first Hager to reach North American shores came during the Colonial 
		Revolution as an officer in the Hessian mercenaries. Deciding that the 
		cause of the colonists was just, he transferred his allegiance, and 
		joined George Washington's staff. After the war he settled in Virginia, 
		and during the Civil War between the States another Colonel Hager served 
		with General Stonewall Jackson. That was George's paternal grandfather. 
		It is interesting to note that George's maternal grandfather, a 
		Presbyterian clergyman, served in the same war as a chaplain-at&#8209;large, 
		one of two serving in this capacity in the Confederate forces. The 
		colonel's son, John Jackson Hager II, and the chaplain's daughter, Maude 
		Livingstone Caldwell, were married, and to them were born four sons, of 
		whom the second was George Caldwell.<br><br>George was born in Bristol, 
		a town in the tree&#8209;tufted, brook&#8209;riven hills of eastern Tennessee. His 
		birth date was January 1. That date! What wouldn't a numerologist make 
		of it! George, however, is of the school that thinks &quot;any day makes a 
		good birthday!&quot;<br><br>The John Jackson Hagers were a happy family&#8209;a 
		harmonious sextette. Here was an earnest, deeply religious home&#8209;yet one 
		peopled with merry, and sometimes Puckish, hearts.<br><br>When George 
		was 8, his father gave him a typewriter. In one of his first encounters 
		with the machine, he poked out, small&#8209;boy fashion, the following note 
		which was addressed to his father, in whose general store George had 
		been working: <br><br>Dear Sir. <br><br>I would like to have some of the 
		money you owe me, I hate to ask but I am dead broke. You will find your 
		full account below. I would like to have as much as possible. <br><br>J. 
		J. Hagers Account<br><br>5dollars and 75 cts <br><br>George C. Hager<br>
		<br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="427" src="hager2apic081938sm.jpg" style="float: left" width="350">What 
		a chuckle of pride George's father must have enjoyed , The good fun in 
		that note and in many others I found tucked, away in a scrapbook in 
		George's library, leads me to think that here was one of the most 
		affectionate and inspiring of families. No achievement,. however small, 
		even by the smallest youngsters in the group, ever went unnoted. Did one 
		of the boys graduate from grammar school, he found himself promptly 
		flooded with cheering letters and &quot;wires&quot; from parents, brothers, aunts, 
		uncles, and cousins.<br><br>George grew. Putting high school behind him 
		at 16, he entered King College in Bristol, and there, contemplating the 
		ministry as his lifework, he concentrated his youthful enthusiasms on 
		oratory. The Athenaeans, his campus literary society, used to hear him 
		regularly, on such themes as the Epic of Our National Life and The 
		Working Principles of American Life. But George found time for serious 
		study, for part&#8209;time work, and for participation in all the campus 
		sports. He &#8209;was, by the way, a hard man to match on the cinder track and 
		on the basketball court. <br><br>AT 18, as I have said, George became 
		Professor G. C. Hager, principal of the high school&#8209; at Wyndale, 
		Virginia. There had been, his school board conceded, an onerous 
		disciplinary problem before he came. There wasn't afterward. One day, 
		for instance, he received this note from a sadly perplexed and baffled 
		parent: <br><br>Mr. Hagy: i will Send my daughter Back to school and i 
		want you to Correct heare and make heare mind you and do what you tell 
		heare to do and if She disabyes your orders you must whip heare and make 
		heare mind you. <br><br>George doesn't recall that such stringent 
		measures as the father recommended were necessary, but many an old&#8209;timer 
		in Wyndale remembers the young man who by kind but unswervable firmness 
		made a decent, studious school out of what had been a nerve&#8209;ravelling 
		&quot;roughhouse.&quot;<br><br>There followed then for George two years as head of 
		the Latin department of the high school at Knoxville, Tennessee&#8209;and new 
		plans for a career. Law had now become his absorbing interest. 
		Accordingly he began to study in the law department of the University of 
		Tennessee and to read in a local law office. He was admitted to the 
		Tennessee bar, in 1915 and a year later took his degree in law. Maybe 
		there's a prophetic note in the fact that George's highest grades came 
		in corporation law&#8209;for today that's the branch of law in which he works 
		almost exclusively.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="276" src="hager2bpic081938sm.jpg" style="float: left" width="350">George 
		had just set up his practice&#8209;one that, while lean at first, gave 
		prospects of later amplitude&#8209;when the World War came along. He enlisted 
		as a private in 1917, obtained a commission in France, and served at the 
		front as a lieutenant of the field artillery. He is at present a major 
		in the Reserve Corps. George, like many another ex&#8209;service man, is 
		taciturn about the War days. But it is possible that the psychological 
		experience of those years left a residue in his sub consciousness which 
		now seeks expression in his vital interest in Rotary's Fourth 
		Object&#8209;International Service.<br><br>Back from the War, George came to 
		Chicago in 1920, where, on the basis of his pre&#8209;War law experience, the 
		Cook County Supply Company employed him to help it consolidate with its 
		several subsidiary corporations. Out of this and several other 
		reorganizations came , the Consumers Company of Illinois, the largest 
		combined coal, ice, and building&#8209;materials corporation in the United 
		States. George is its secretary. George has this business institution&#8209;or 
		rather a man' then in it&#8209;to thank for his introduction to Rotary. And, 
		conversely, Rotary has that man to thank for George. Marshall Keig, then 
		executive vice&#8209;president of the company, was a member of the Chicago 
		Rotary Club at the time and invited George to share his membership. &quot;I 
		didn't need a second invitation,&quot; George says, &quot;for I used to hear great 
		things about Rotary in Knoxville from some of my older lawyer friends.&quot;<br>
		<br>One of the fine aspects of Rotary is the spirit with which men 
		accept the responsibilities of Committee membership. George accepted 
		them&#8209;from the start. In fact, he welcomed them. His interest in the 
		Membership Committee of the Chicago Rotary Club led to his Chairmanship 
		of that group (in his 11 years in the Club he has added 50 members to 
		the roll). A term on the Board of Directors followed. He was elected 
		President of the Club for 1932&#8209;33 and administered a very successful 
		year, proving an able speaker, a fluent and charming toastmaster, and an 
		affable host. He had, and has, an uncanny memory. for names. During his 
		term he could thumb the pages of the roster and call every member by his 
		Tom, Dick, or Elmer, looking only at his picture. That was no 
		inconsiderable feat in &quot;Old Number One” &#8209;with its approximately 600 
		members.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="271" src="hager3apic081938sm.jpg" style="float: left" width="350">George 
		presided at board meetings with dignity and aplomb, and no phase of the 
		more than complicated mechanism was too trivial for his specialized 
		interest and Action. While he paid strict attention to, his business, he 
		ate and slept with Rotary and, he began to interest himself in the 
		details of Rotary International. His horizon rising above the Chicago 
		Rotary Club, he was made a member of the Foundation Committee of Rotary 
		International, in which activity he was recognized as a, serious worker. 
		His reward was more work.<br><br>His continuous service in the affairs 
		of Rotary International since 1932&#8209;as a Director and as member of many 
		Committees, attests to his indefatigability.<br><br>As if George didn't 
		have enough to do, he has found time within the last few years to serve 
		as president of the Chicago Federal Savings and Loan Association and as 
		an officer and director in many other corporations., He is active in 
		many trade associations in his business field, and belongs to various 
		patriotic societies and to Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.<br><br>Does 
		the man ever relax? Yes! By trotting out one of his three hobbies: 
		deep&#8209;sea fishing, stamp collecting, and reading biography. And George is 
		no tyro in any of these departments. There's nothing like tussling with 
		a 186 1/2 &#8209;pound tarpon for an hour or two&#8209;as he did once in the Gulf of 
		Mexico&#8209;to clear a man's mind for a tussle with the realities of living, 
		George thinks. Yes, he got the fish!<br><br>George has one other 
		hobby&#8209;at least for him it's a diversion rather than a duty. Writing to 
		relatives! The old family unity persists even though George's father 
		died some years ago. The mother and her four sons give mail routes 
		between them little rest. Those three brothers, with whom from their 
		father George first learned the principles of fair play in masculine 
		society, deserve mention. Clint, the oldest son, was, for many years, 
		United States district attorney at Atlanta, Georgia; John Jackson III, 
		the third son, is in the United States postal service in Bristol, 
		Tennessee; and Richard, the fourth son, is manager of the Eastern Air 
		Lines in Atlanta. The boys are proud of each other.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="385" src="hager3bpic081938sm.jpg" style="float: left" width="350">But 
		have we forgotten the President's lady? We have not! We are saving, 
		well, the best for almost the last. Grace Leslie Wilson added Hager to 
		her name 15 years ago. Her father is a retired United States Army 
		colonel, Jennings B. Wilson, living in San Francisco, and she numbers 
		Roger Williams, Captain Spier Spencer, and General Richard A. Sarle 
		among her ancestors.<br><br>Now Grace Hager is no &quot;Rotary widow.&quot; Not 
		only does she smile approval on George's efforts as businessman and 
		Rotarian; she urges him on. Comely, understanding, a perfect, hostess, 
		Grace will surely deserve .50 percent of the credit due the Hager 
		household when these 12 months are spent. <br><br>BUT lest my hopes for the year seem overly sanguine, 
		listen to pioneer veteran member William Jenson, the first Secretary of 
		the first Rotary Club: &quot;He has the experience, years, temperament, and 
		ability to qualify fully for this great and honored position. I predict 
		this coming year to be the best year for Rotary with its new 
		general&#8209;George C. Hager.&quot;<br><br>They used to call the new President 
		&quot;Caldwell&quot; at home&#8209;because there were at least a half dozen other 
		Georges in his wide family. relationship. But in the list of Rotary's 28 
		Presidents, &#8209;&quot;George&quot; is a name unique.<br><br>Yes, I think Rotary may 
		safely take the &quot;let George do it&quot; attitude&#8209;as far as George's part of 
		the vast assignment goes. But Rotary&#8209;as. every President and as every 
		Rotarian has always well known&#8209;is not a one-man &#8209;assignment. It's a job, 
		rather, for 199,000 stouthearted men of goodwill round the wide world.<br>
