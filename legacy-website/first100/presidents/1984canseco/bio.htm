		complete a specialty in Allergology at Northwestern University in 
		Chicago, Illinois, and a second specialty in Clinical Immunology at the 
		University of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.<br><br>In June of 1949, he 
		created the Department of Allergology at the School of Medicine of the 
		Autonomous University of Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico.<br><br>From 1950 to 1952, 
		he served as Chair of the Allergology Services at the Autonomous 
		University of Nuevo Leon. He then co-founded the Monterrey Football 
		Club, joined Rotary International, and became President of the Rotary 
		Club of Monterrey. He also raised funds for the purpose of building the 
		first Children's Hospital in Monterrey.<br><br>During the 1970¥s Dr. 
		Carlos Canseco GonzAlez created a series of undergraduate and graduate 
		courses in Allergy and Clinical Immunology at the University of Nuevo 
		Le√≥n. This allowed students to complete 3 years of Internal Medicine in 
		allergology. By 1986 the medical residents who completed the program in 
		allergology were being accepted and admitted at the University of 
		Southern California, the Mayo Clinic, and at the National Medical Center 
		in Mexico City. <br><br>Between 1987 and 2000, he establishes the

		International. During his tenure, he proposed a program to eradicate 
		polio. Rotary International and the World Health Organization began 
		planning for the most ambitious program in its history to immunize all 
		of the world¥s children against polio. The plan required collaboration 
		with international, national and local health agencies and took shape 
		early in Dr. Canseco Gonzales year as RI President when he appointed the 
		Polio 2005 Committee. He invited Dr. Albert Sabin, developer of the oral 
		polio vaccine, to serve as a special consultant to the committee. The 
		program for eradication of polio continues to this day. During his term 
		at President of Rotary International, Dr. Canseco Gonzalez worked 
		diligently to form new Rotary Clubs. Rotary International experienced an 
		increase of 978 new clubs and 45,000 new members.<br><br>

		pledge of US$120,000,000 to fund its PolioPlus program was announced in 
		October 1985 at the 40th anniversary of the United Nations. This

		community. Within three years, Rotarians had more that doubled their 
		fundraising goal, donating US 247 million.<br><br>Dr. Carlos Canseco 
		GonzAlez will go down in history as the Rotary International President

		$120,000,000 to provide enough vaccine to rid the world of polio by the 
		Centenary of Rotary in 2005.<br><br>His goal was to use an aerosol 
		vaccination which he had co-developed with Dr. Albert Sabin in 1982. In January, 2002, he was honored as one of the Public Health Heroes

		to eminent Mexicans with a distinguished lifetime career who contributed 
		most &quot;toward the welfare of the Nation and mankind&quot;.<br><br>Only Mexican
