		the biggest event of these years for the Salt Lake Club was hosting the 
		International Rotary Convention in Salt Lake in 1919. Salt Lake had bid 
		for the convention as early as 1915 and had withdrawn its invitation. 
		The Salt Lake club had also been willing to defer their request for the 
		1919 convention date if wartime exigencies made it necessary for it to 
		be held in a more central location. As it turned out, the war was over 
		by then, and so the Rotary International “Victory Convention” came to 
		Salt Lake City. The Salt Lake Club made many preparations for this 
		event, some of them indicated in the note in the minutes of April 1, 
		1919, which reads:<br><br>Moved and carried, that from this date, until 
		after the Convention that the Club entertain no visitors, except 
		Rotarian visitors at its meetings and that there be no speeches except 
		for members, without the unanimous consent of the Club, and that Roy 
		Daynes be invited to use 30 minutes at each meeting, drilling the Club 
		in singing.<br><br>Later in April they adopted a uniform outfit to be 
		worn during the convention consisting of a blue serge jacket, white or 
		cream serge trousers, white shirt, white shoes a white straw hat and an 
		appropriate armband. That they were serious about this prescribed outfit 
		is shown by the imposition of a ten-dollar fine for anyone not wearing 
		it during the convention week and a provision that anyone not paying 
		this fine within twenty days after the end of the convention was to be 
		automatically dropped from membership.<br><br>3,467 Rotarians attended 
		the convention, the plenary meetings of which were held in the Salt Lake 
		Tabernacle. Most of these delegates arrived in special trains and 
		quickly made their presence known by songs and yells. Some brought bands 
		and marched to the hotel, carrying banners and cheering for their own 
		cities. Many groups were in costume, giving an air of festivity. 
		Convention days were ablaze with flags of the United States, Canada, 
		Great Britain, and Club – Cuba being the first country after Canada and 
		the British Isles to join Rotary, and by that time having five clubs. 
		Among those attending were delegates from ten clubs in the Mountain West 
		that Club 24 had helped organize – those in Billings, Butte, Great 
		falls, Helena, and Missoula, in Montana; Boise, Idaho Falls, and 
		Pocatello in Idaho; and Logan and Ogden, in Utah. <br><br>It is of 
		special interest to Club 24 that Richard L. Evans attended this tenth 
		convention of Rotary international as a Boy Scout on duty. Among his 
		ushering and other jobs was moving the pushcarts brought to Salt Lake 
		City by Atlantic City Rotarians as a bid to the next convention. He 
		later declared that his duties in connection with the convention made 
		his think of Rotary as something different and significant. It was also 
		at this convention, in the Tabernacle, that
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/philosophy/ziegler/barker/index.htm" name="Barker">
		Dr. Charles E. Barker</a> delivered his inspired talk, “A Father’s 
		Responsibility to His Son”-a memorable address that started him on a 
		series of lectures which eventually reached more than 10 million high 
		school and university students.”<br><br>Contributed by the staff of RC 
		of Salt Lake City&nbsp;

		Pueblo</a> #43<br><br>Six Presidents of Rotary International have 
		visited Rotary 43 over the years. The record seems to suggest that one, 
		John Poole of Washington, D.C., didn't know, in 1919, that he was going 
		to do so.<br>&nbsp;<br>Poole had put together 
		a trainload of eastern Rotarians and their wives, which was headed for 
		the international convention in Salt Lake City, supposedly via Denver.<br>
		<br>A stop had been planned there for a bit of ah, R&amp;R.<br><br>A member 
		of the Pueblo Club, a banker, Alva Adams, who was a former Governor of 
		Colorado, happened to remember that Poole had a substantial loan 
		outstanding. And so it came to pass that on 14 June 1919, the Poole 
		special arrived, not in Denver, but in Pueblo for a day planned for them 
		by Rotarians.<br><br>Pueblo got a special mention in President Poole's 
		speech at the SLC convention, and a silk banner. The Denver club was not 
		amused. Rotary 43's record is silent on what happened to the loan.<br>

		101 more clubs had appeared by the time of the Convention giving a total 
		of 530 Clubs in the world (though only 496 were officially affiliated). 
		The growth of Rotary was still predominantly occurring in the land of 
		its birth.<br>
		<br>Total registration at Salt Lake City was 3,038 where there was an 
		&quot;aridity of alcoholic beverages and thirst for the living waters of 
		Rotary&quot; according to Will G. Farrell of the Salt Lake City Rotary Club.<br>
		<br>Outgoing President Poole talked of
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/collins/index.htm">
		Service Above Self</a> and the extension process that was becoming more 
		and more international as countries such as Cuba, Uruguay, China and 
		Fiji established Rotary Clubs. &quot;The sun never sets on Rotarians&quot;.<br>
		<br>Paul Harris sent his message addressing the Convention as &quot;Friends 
		of the Victory Convention&quot;. &quot;A Rotarian who sees nothing in Rotary 
		beyond the business he can get out of it is a dead Rotarian and the 
		sooner he can be buried the better for the cause&quot;.<br><br>Convention Reports included one on the 
		Menace of Bolshevism! <br><br>The Endowment Fund had grown to almost $60 
		cash in a/c 137906 of the Union Trust Company.<br><br>Albert S. Adams of 
		Atlanta took over the leadership of the movement.<br><br>
