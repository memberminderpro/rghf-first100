					a celebration embracing beauty and history – from the 
					brilliant blue sun drenched sky (yet brisk 55 degrees) to 
					the sentiment, to the fellowship, but
					mostly to the memories. I imagine the day was equally as 
					delightful 65 years ago when the <b>
					<a href="index.htm#Sundial">Plaque for
					Peace was placed by Denver Rotarians atop Mt. Evans</a></b>. This 
					gorgeous day in July was spearheaded by
					Mountain Foothills Rotarian Wil Swart, to re-dedicate the 
					monument, to bring about a new awareness,
					and bring together Rotarians to enjoy its greatness. And 
					that he did!<p>Rotarians from all over Colorado gathered to hear Mr. 
					Swart’s remarks
					along with Past District Governor (PDG), Norris Hermsmeyer’s 
					rededication,
					and the music accompaniment of “The Original Cow Boy
					Band*.” Particular mention of a special attendee on this 
					day, revered
					Rotarian, PDG Loy Dickinson, along with a family that he has 
					been
					hosting from Czechoslovakia. A family that assisted him when 
					his plane
					went down during WWII – one can only imagine the impact and
					memories this day presented for all of them.</p>
					<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">
					<img height="181" hspace="10" src="images/norris_h_couple2.jpg" width="126" align="right" vspace="10" border="0"></span>Past District Governor Norris Hermsmeyer’s remarks were
					appropriately monumental in scope and are reprinted below 
					for your
					enjoyment. A special thanks to Wil Swart for his efforts in 
					bringing this
					important piece of Rotary Global History to our attention.</p>
					<p><b>PDG Norris Hermsmeyer’s</b> remarks: </p>
					<p>“Many of the comments here 
					today come from the book, “A
					Century of Service,” by Daniel C. Forward, a book created to 
					mark Rotary’s 100th anniversary. Other
					parts of these comments came from articles posted on the 
					Rotary 100 history website.</p>
					<p>“One of the things that appeals to me about Rotary is how it 
					continues to evolve. Founded in 1905, the case
					might be made that it was a club for one guy to get known in 
					his community and looking for a fellowship of
					professional men. The case could also be made that Rotary 
					was to be a “leads” club, men of different
					professions dealing with each other based on a mutual 
					respect and common business ethic.</p>
					<p>“Shortly after the organizations founding, a new focus was 
					found, that of serving the community as
					volunteers in ways that were appropriate for and to that 
					community. Rotary’s motto then as it is today, is
					“Service Above Self.”</p>
					<p>“Peace was certainly not considered to be a role for Rotary 
					in the early
					organizational days.<br>
					“During the period of 1912 through World War 1, the idea 
					that Rotary was
					or might be a medium for the promotion of international 
					peace and good
					will was voiced many times by many clubs and individual 
					Rotarians
					around the world. Many of these same individuals and clubs 
					would take
					action as they saw fit within their own groups.</p>
					<p>“In 1920, when Rotary International met in Atlanta, the idea 
					that peace
					and good will might become a standard of Rotary was first 
					expressed. In 1921, Rotary met in Edinburgh,
					Scotland. Many of the 2523 attendees had lost friends and 
					family in the WWI conflict. They were weary
					witnesses to the need for world Peace.</p>
					<p>“Just 16 years after Rotary began, it became an organization 
					with the worthy objective to “aid in the
					advancement of international peace and goodwill through a 
					fellowship of business and professional men (and
					now women) of all nations united in the Rotary ideal of 
					service.”
					“Rotary has approached peacemaking systematically—it has 
					sought to breakdown the barriers that cause
					people to point fingers at one another. By trying to 
					understand people’s points of view and reaching across
					lines of race, religion and culture to become partners in 
					service to all mankind, tensions are reduced and
					friendships increased. Humanitarian aid has been Rotary’s 
					answer to hunger, sickness, illiteracy and
					economic disaster, the seeds of conflict.</p>
					<p>“Over the years, RI Boards and clubs have laid out policies 
					and programs of how Rotarians can contribute
					to the peacemaking role.</p>
					<p>“President Warren G. Harding (a Rotarian until his election 
					to office) in 1923 said, “If I could plant Rotary
					in every community in the world, I would do it, and then I 
					would guarantee the tranquility and forward march
					of the world.”
					“One of the initiatives in the period between WWI and WWII 
					was the creation of the Waterton-Glacier
					International Peace Park on the border between the U.S. and 
					Canada.</p>
					<p>“The Rotary Peace marker in this park at the point where the 
					Continental Divide in the U.S. meets the point
					marking the origin of the Continental Divide in Canada is 
					significant to us today for two reasons.</p>
					<p>
					<img border="0" src="../../1941davis/davis.gif" width="206" height="236" align="left">– A prime motivator of that memorial was 
					<b><a href="../../1941davis/index.htm">Thomas Davis, the 
					RI President from Butte, Montana </a></b>who
					would serve in 1940-41. We shall hear more about him in a 
					minute.</p>
					<p>– One of the ongoing projects of this District of Rotary, 
					spearheaded by PDG Mat Matson of Conifer
					Rotary is the development and maintenance of the Continental 
					Divide Trail running 3100 miles from
					Canada to Mexico. Indeed it is his hope to create a Peace 
					Memorial marker at the end of the
					Continental Divide when it meets the Mexican border. It may 
					be a little difficult to define that point
					given the relative flat land of New Mexico at that point.</p>
					<p>“With the “Winds of War” again threatening, the RI 
					convention in 1940 was held in Havana, Cuba. The
					3700 delegates to that gathering adopted a resolution 
					calling for “freedom, justice, truth, sanctity of the
					pledged word and respect for human rights.” Fast forward to 
					1948 when the newly chartered United Nations
					wrote the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, based on 
					the framework of this same RI resolution
					adopted in 1940.</p>
					<p>“The 1941 Rotary convention was in Denver with 8900 in 
					attendance, 90% of the Rotarians from the U.S.
					and the balance from other parts of the Western Hemisphere. 
					The dilemma was that many Rotarians around
					the world were at war, or soon would be.
					“The Peace Memorial we see before us today was to have been 
					dedicated by the 1940-41 RI President
					Armando de Arruda Pereira of Sao Paulo, Brazil, but 
					inclement weather made the dedication impossible.</p>
					<p>“Perhaps, fortuitously, the RI President who would serve for 
					the Rotary year 1941-42, Thomas Davis
					(remember him from the Peace Memorial on the Canadian 
					border) of Butte, Montana was able to return to
					Colorado for the formal dedication.
					</p>
					<p>The Event was carefully
					monitored by the natives
					“In his address to the Denver convention, President David 
					knowing what
					was facing the world stated, “You and I know Rotary’s 
					limitations—but
					we also know its capacities. We know we can do something. 
					With a
					world full of reasons for pessimism, I am not pessimistic. 
					For my faith in
					the ultimate triumph of goodness and kindliness is as deep 
					as my faith in
					a power infinitely greater than man’s. Yet in that faith I 
					find no excuse,
					no reason for resignation.”</p>
					<p>“It is not surprising that the theme for RI President 
					Davis’s year was
					“Peace will Come.” We know Rotarians worldwide worked toward 
					that
					end, just as following the war so many Rotarians were 
					instrumental in the creation of the United Nations,
					an organization dedicated to bringing men and countries 
					together to end peace and strife in the world.</p>
					<p>“Before you, you see a memorial built of active rock, part 
					of a wall, at an elevation of over fourteen thousand
					feet with a mountain view finder. The finder or finger is of 
					bronze placed on a circular plate of bronze 14
					½ inches in diameter. The finger is moveable upon the 
					circular plate upon which radiates lines to identify
					mountains and other points of interest.</p>

					objectives, including the one passed at the 1921
					Rotary International Convention identifying the “advancement

					peace through a fellowship of business and professional mean

				<div>
					<blockquote>
						<br>*Mr. Swart was instrumental in reconstituting this infamous 
					band that’s roots began in 1878 in Dodge City, Kansas where 
					Will was a former resident. The band “disbanded” in 1890 and 
					the equipment sold to a Pueblo, Colo. resident; who 
					proceeded to reestablish the band in Idaho Springs in 1905. 
					The band was a huge success through the boom mining days and 
					while no one knows when it again was dispersed, it is again 
					alive and well thanks to Will’s reconstitution of the band 
					last year. One hundred years later and also in celebration 
					of Rotary’s Centennial, “The Original Cow Boy Band” is 
					hooting and tooting once again.</blockquote>
