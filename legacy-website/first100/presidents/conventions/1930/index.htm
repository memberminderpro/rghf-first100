		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/rip/images/1929newsom.jpg" style="float: left">M. Eugene Newsom, 
		Durham, North Carolina<br><br>&quot;Who among us, though, can think of 
		Rotary's beginnings, of its struggles and accomplishments through 
		twenty&#8209;five years, of our pilgrimage at this time to its birthplace, 
		without finding those thoughts ever turning to that sterling character, 
		friend of us all, Founder of Rotary, Paul Harris. Gifted with the force 
		of simplicity&#8209;sturdy in his faith&#8209;prophetic in his vision - ready and 
		willing at all times to be the servant of the least of us - surely 
		providence has been pleased with his handiwork, and has preserved him to 
		us through the years that he might still impart to us something of that 
		faith and courage which he so fully possesses, in the charting of our 
		course which leads to goals farther on.&quot; <br><br>From “Rotary's 
		Increasing Purpose”, RI President M. Eugene Newson, 1930 Chicago 
		Convention.<br><br>The 25th Anniversary Convention at (obviously) 
		Chicago in 1930 disappointed with its over-emphasis on administrative 
		matters. Plenary sessions were over long and the whole convention felt 
		overcrowded. Some of the questions arising focused on whether or not it 
		was proper to have more than one Rotary Club in a city. Secretary Perry 
		warned the Convention that there was a danger of too many rules. The 
		Convention was set against a background of economic depression which led 
		to eighteen clubs being lost.<br><br>All but 3 of the previous 
		International President's were at Chicago. The House of friendship was 
		located on the lower level of the Stevens Hotel and many trips were 
		organized - to the University of Chicago and boating on Lake Michigan. 
		Wives of Rotarians enjoyed tea at the Edgewater Beach Hotel. There was a 
		magnificent Venetian Carnival in Lake Michigan, just off the Navy Pier. 
		Rotarians were also invited to enjoy a round of golf from no less than 
		30 different golf clubs.<br><br>Paul Harris was not present due to 
		health problems and, as had become the custom, a message from the 
		founder was read out to the audience. &quot;Welcome Rotary, welcome, welcome 
		back home&quot;, his message had begun. &quot;I am not ashamed of the Rotary of 
		1905. It contained the germ of all that there is today, although it was 
		at first very much self-centered.&quot; He went on to use a well-known phrase 
		about the battle between the 'cans' and 'cants'. &quot;The cants had never 
		won a single permanent victory. The broad visions, the nobler purposes 
		have always won. Rotary is a social movement&quot;.<br><br>Harris' message 
		described Rotary as 'a social movement and as such was in danger of the 
		blighting effects of precedent. It has already suffered from the 
		plague'. He went on: 'Rotary needs a department for constructive 
		criticism - something comparable to the research departments of great 
		businesses.' He went on to conclude: 'If Rotary is to realize its proper 
		destiny, it must be evolutionary at all times, revolutionary on 
		occasion...'<br><br>Before any delegates could show any disappointment 
		that their founder was not present-especially since he only lived a few 
		blocks away-a remarkable event occurred. The audience suddenly became 
		aware that he WAS PRESENT IN THE HALL along with Jean. The hall erupted 
		with cheering and applause.<br><br>He was placed impromptu on stage and 
		before RI President Gene Newson had finished telling his fellow 
		Rotarians that regretfully 'Paul can't speak to you this morning', 
		Harris was speaking to his people -just a few words - his first to the 
		Convention in 18 years.<br>Paul said, &quot;I do…entertain fond hopes that in 
		some future occasion I shall be able to appear in my own person and read 
		or deliver a message to you.&quot; Paul's exile from Rotary Conventions was 
		now over.<br><br>Jean Harris also spoke: &quot;We who have done so little, 
		deeply appreciate seeing you all and meeting you who have done so much&quot;.<br>
		<br>Paul Harris showed the movement at their Silver Jubilee celebrations 
		that his real place was with the great masses in the floor of the hall 
		rather than with the administrators on stage. The delegates stood until 
		the great man had left the hall.<br><br>President Newsom paid tribute to 
		the 'mother' club and Harris. &quot;Gifted with the force of simplicity - 
		sturdy in his faith - prophetic in his vision - ready and willing at all 
		times to be the servant of the least of us - surely providence has been 
		pleased with his handiwork, and has preserved him to us through the 
		years…&quot;<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/conventions/1930/images/theman.jpg" style="float: left">President Herbert Hoover also sent his greetings by 
		saying: &quot;The impressive attendance from so many countries is renewed 
		evidence of the spirit of international good will which is so 
		significant a development of our times and in the encouragement of which 
		Rotary has played such a wonderful part.&quot;<br><br><br><br><br>Seventeen of the original 1905 Rotarians had a group 
		photograph taken at the 25th Convention. Those present included the 
		'songster' Harry Ruggles and Al White (the man who was responsible for 
		ending the 'rotating round the offices' in Club #1). Unfortunately, 
		neither Harris or Silvester Schiele were pictured.<br><br>Nicholl's

		European delegates to the Silver Jubilee Convention went out en bloc. 
		Accommodation had been reserved on the Cunard liner, R.M.S. Carmania for 
		the outward journey and on the R.M.S. Ascania for the return. It was 
		perhaps appropriate that the Carmania was also celebrating 25 years 
		afloat! The plan was for the ship to leave Southampton on June 7, 
		calling at Vlissingen in Holland, Le Havre in France and then to sail to 
		New York, reaching there on June 15.<br><br>The party would then stay 
		there for several nights at the Pennsylvania Hotel, with a variety of 
		motor sightseeing tours arranged. On the 20th, the delegates would take 
		a morning train to Philadelphia for a short tour of the city. Then, they 
		would all travel further South by rail to Washington for a couple of 
		nights at the Willard Hotel. More motor tours, and finally it was an 
		overnight sleeper train to Chicago, reaching there on the afternoon of 
		the 22nd.<br><br>

		delegates were staying at a wide variety of hotels. On June 27, they 
		were back o a sleeper train to Buffalo for a trip to the Niagara Falls. 
		After a steamer trip across Lake Ontario, the party went to Toronto and 
		then overnight to Montreal. Here, there was another sightseeing tour 
		arranged before embarking on the R.M.S. Ascania on the morning of June 
		29. For the return voyage, the liner called at Le Havre, and Plymouth, 
		instead of Southampton, with disembarcation scheduled for July 7 and 8.<br>
		<br>The cost of the tour from London with cabin class accommodation on 
		the ship, first class travel on trains with sleepers for overnight 
		travel, and all sightseeing and transfers was about £100.<br><br>Basil
