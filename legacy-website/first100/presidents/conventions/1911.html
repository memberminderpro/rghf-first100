		<a href="/first100/leaders/collins/">Frank 
		Collins</a>, from an article in The Rotarian February 1977. This 
		Minneapolis, Minnesota Rotarian spoke at the 1911 Portland convention. 
		It was Rotary's second convention with Paul Harris in his second term as 
		president of the National Association of Rotary Clubs. After meeting 
		Harris, he was asked to address the convention and one phrase of his 
		talk stuck: &quot;Service, Not Self.&quot;<br><br>
		<a href="/first100/leaders/sheldon/index.htm">
		Arthur Frederick Sheldon</a> joined Rotary Club of Chicago in 1908. He 
		became responsible for our vocational service, but is best known for our 
		motto when he coined the phrase, &quot;He profits most who serves best.&quot; He 
		first reported on it at the 1910 convention, but Paul Harris asked that 
		he present it again at Portland. Unable to attend, it was read to great 
		acclamation.<br><br>The second Convention of the National Association 
		met at the Commercial Club Convention Hall in the City of Roses - 
		Portland, Oregon - between the 21st and 23rd of August 1911.<br><br>
		Again, there was a clear effort to define the embryonic 
		organization.Arthur Sheldon gave a written definition of Rotary. He went 
		on to extend his famous words in an essay entitled 'My Platform' 
		discussing the so-called scientific age. It said, &quot;That the science of 
		business is the science of service, he profits most who serves best.&quot;<br>
		<br>James E Pinkham (President of the Seattle Rotary Club)- someone who 
		understood the true notion of Rotary better than almost anyone in 1911 - 
		and Chesley Perry also wrote of the &quot;Elements of Rotarianism&quot;. It has 
		been said that it was Pinkham that picked out Sheldon's famous phrase to 
		be used by the Rotary movement.<br><br>The Elements of Rotarianism 
		included concepts such as Integrity - the qualification of Rotary, 
		Opportunity - the privilege of Rotary, Service - the responsibility of 
		Rotary and Success - the result of Rotary.<br><br>There were clearly 
		many differences of opinion as to the definition and objectives of 
		Rotary. The third part of the Resolutions Committee stated, &quot;That as 
		each member is selected to represent his business, an invitation and 
		opportunity is thereby extended to him to use the Club and his 
		acquaintance therein in the extension of his business relations with 
		other members and their friends, and that no obligation of patronage 
		exists.&quot;<br><br>Twenty-two Clubs were represented with a total delegate 
		vote of 58. 149 delegates attended. Perry was announced as Rotary's new 
		secretary on a salary of $100 per month plus $25 expenses.<br><br>
		<a href="/first100/presidents/conventions/1911/images/woman.jpg">
		Was she the second employee of Rotary</a>? Earlier in 1911 the Rotary 
		Club of Chicago and the National Association of Rotary Clubs had agreed 
		to share the services of a stenographer. The first office of the 
		Association had been in Harris' office. With the move to the 1st Nat'l 
		Bank Bldg on Dearborn, the association got its first office and Chicago 
		shared the offices as their first office.<br><br>Furniture for Perry's 
		new office were loaned by Ches and
		<a href="/first100/leaders/schiele/">Silvester 
		Schiele</a>. Unlike today, the initial clubs were allowed to design 
		their own Rotary wheels with &quot;such additional element as may be peculiar 
		to the city in which the Club is located&quot;. This produced a wide variety 
		of taste and design!<br><br>When the Convention was called to order, it 
		was announced that the
		<a href="/first100/clubs/cities/clubs/50london.htm">
		Rotary Club of London</a> had been formed. Clubs in foreign countries 
		was discussed extensively. This made a total of 36 Clubs with 34 in the 
		USA, 1 in Canada (<a href="/first100/clubs/cities/clubs/35winnipeg.htm">Winnipeg</a>) 
		and 1 in England (London). Interest in Rotary was spreading fast with 
		reports of initial movement in places as diverse as Atlanta, Saskatoon, 
		Glasgow and Melbourne, Australia. <br><br>Not for the first time, 
		President Harris admitted to the Convention that he had acted on his own 
		initiative and with no authority to consider forming the Rotary Club of 
		London. As always, Harris motives were genuine and pure. Paul had taken 
		up with Harvey C Wheeler of the Boston Rotary Club the matter of 
		establishing a Club in London. Wheeler responded that the club had been 
		successfully started. Wheeler intended to start a club in Paris,France 
		the next year. Harris also told of how he was in communication with 
		gentlemen in Glasgow, Scotland and also with gentlemen in Melbourne and 
		Sydney Australia.<br><br>Even at this early stage, it was becoming clear 
		that Rotary could potentially become an international force.<br><br>NOTE 
		- Formation, Organization and Chartering all occur at different times!<br>
