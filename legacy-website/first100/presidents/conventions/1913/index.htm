		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19"  width: 1050px;>Until the Houston 
		convention in 1914, Rotary had celebrated all its conventions in August. 
		After the convention in Buffalo, 18-21 August 1913, the dates of the 
		Houston convention were changed to 22-26 June 1914. Subsequently, the 
		conventions of San Francisco (1915) and Cincinnati (1916) were 
		celebrated in July. At that point, Rotary established a tradition, 
		programming the convention for a date near the end of the Rotary year, 
		in May or June.<br><br>Although the present practice to identify the 
		salient president of Rotary International with the convention that is 
		celebrated at the end of his or her year of office, does not necessarily 
		apply to the conventions celebrated during the term of office of Frank 
		L. Mulholland, 1914-15. He was chosen by the delegates of the Houston 
		convention, and he participated in the convention of San Francisco, 
		18-23 July 1915. Russell Greiner, 1913-14, and Arch Klumph, 1916-17, 
		celebrated two conventions during their terms in office; they shared 
		these conventions with their predecessors and successors.<br><br>

		Clubs were newly formed. It was, therefore, the task of the older 
		Rotarians and Clubs to fully explain Rotary to their new infant Clubs.<br>
		<br>Glenn Mead told the new clubs at the Convention of how the primary 
		aim of Rotary's beginning of exchanging business had been repudiated by 
		Paul Harris at the 1912 Convention. He told delegates that business is 
		helped by making the businessman more competent and better equipped to 
		conduct his business.<br><br>Rotary's Pink Goat Controversy<br><br>
		Before there were Rotary Anns, there were Pink Goats. How many Rotarians 
		know that they are involved in an organization that once debated the 
		&quot;propriety&quot; of having a pink goat? How many know of the disagreement 
		between a &quot;great leader&quot; and the Secretary of Rotary?<br><br>Back in 
		1913, from 18 to 21 August, 930 Rotarians from 77 clubs met in 
		convention in Buffalo, New York, under the leadership of RIP Glenn Mead, 
		of Philadelphia. Rotary founder Paul Harris did not attend. On page 59

		Rotarianmagazine. Under the heading &quot;THE DANGER OF A WHEEL WITHIN A 
		WHEEL,&quot; it read:<br><br>&quot;At the last Rotary convention there was a little 
		relaxation one evening and an &quot;order&quot; was established with an animal as 
		a patron saint. That animal which has been the butt of many a time 
		honored joke and has done some butting himself. In this order he was 
		perhaps appropriately declaimed as &quot;the most fragrant one&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Those 
		who were at the convention know how harmless the sport was. The writer 
		had the honor of being initiated in the same team with Russell Greiner 
		and we still live to tell the tale.<br><br>&quot;The &quot;order&quot; seems to be 
		spreading or multiplying with initiations in many of the clubs and 
		doubtless much good fellowship will be developed thereby but it may be 
		well for us to go slow on this fantastic monkey business. There are 
		those who are doubtful of the propriety and wisdom of encouraging such a 
		piece of nonsense and I am not sure but what they are right. Being a 
		member of the herd I may be allowed to say this much.<br><br>&quot;One man 
		who was not at Buffalo but is recognized as a great leader in Rotary 
		rather logically criticizes the pink goat proposition on the grounds:<br>
		<br>&quot;First, because it detracts from the dignity of the organization 
		which we are striving to establish;<br><br>&quot;Second, because the general 
		impression might be that there is an inner organization, something 
		secret and different than the regular organization, and<br><br>&quot;Third, 
		because attention to such things as this tend to deflect us from our 
		line of thought in Rotary.&quot;<br><br>The piece was signed with the 
		initials, C. R. P.<br><br>C. R. P. just happens to be the initials for 
		Chesley R. Perry, the publisher and editor of The Rotarian. And the 
		&quot;great leader&quot; who was not at Buffalo? The only organization leader 
		shown to be absent from the 1913 Buffalo convention was Paul Harris. And 
		Rotary Anns? They didn't come into being until the following year, 1914, 
		on the way to the convention in Houston.</td>
