		The Rotarian 1915</a><br><br>Until the Houston convention in 1914, 
		Rotary had celebrated all its conventions in August. After the 
		convention in Buffalo, 18-21 August 1913, the dates of the Houston 
		convention were changed to 22-26 June 1914. Subsequently, the 
		conventions of San Francisco (1915) and
		<a href="/first100/presidents/conventions/1916/">
		Cincinnati (1916)</a> were celebrated in July. At that point, Rotary 
		established a tradition, programming the convention for a date near the

		President Mulholland, in his Official capacity began the ritual of

		Albert, a former war correspondent and journalist, was well versed in 
		the horrors of war and recognised the challenges that war can place on 
		Rotarians.It is interesting to note that though the organization was 
		still known as the International Association of Rotary Clubs, the wheel 
		emblem had the more succinct words of 'Rotary International' emblazoned 
		on the badge.<br><br>This was still a time of defining exactly what 
		Rotary was. Along with the Golden Wheel came the Rotary flag and

		COAST DISTRICT:
		<a href="/first100/districts/districts/5150.htm">
		5150</a><br><br>Organizations of all kinds flourish and grow in 
		proportion to the dedication and strength of their membership and their 
		leaders. The growth and strength of Rotary International reflects the 
		service given by its members within their districts over the years. <br>
		<br>Our West Coast District 5150 has been given different numbers over 
		the years. But its record of achievement within the geographical area 
		designated by Rotary International has been matched by only a handful of 
		Rotary districts over the years.<br><br>From the beginning of the first 
		Rotary Club in Chicago, until 1915, there were no Rotary Districts. 
		Clubs acted independently and came together in exchanges between clubs 
		that were geographically close in proximity, and at national meetings 
		organized by Paul Harris and Ches Perry of the Chicago club. <br><br>
		<a href="/first100/presidents/1952brunnier/">H. 
		J. “Bru” Brunnier</a> was President of the Rotary Club of San Francisco 
		in 1914. He is recognized as the originator of the district idea in 
		Rotary. His idea came about during a regional fellowship gathering at a 
		six-city meeting in Tacoma, Washington. Returning by train from Seattle 
		following the conference, Bru awakened in the middle of the night with 
		his idea. He summoned a porter to bring him a railroad schedule of the 
		United States, which also included a map of the USA. Bru’s involvement 
		in Rotary provided him with knowledge of the location of most of the
		<a href="/first100/clubs/cities/numbers.htm">100 
		clubs</a> in Rotary at that time. He placed them on the railroad 
		schedule map with dots to show their location. He then combined the 
		clubs on the basis of rail transportation and arrived at 13 groupings. 
		His map and his idea formed the basis upon which Rotary leaders adopted 
		the district plan at the Rotary Convention of 1915 in San Francisco. <br>
		<br>In 1918, due to the tremendous growth of clubs in Rotary, Bru was 
		again asked to assist in placing Rotary clubs in new districts. Called 
		upon for a third time in 1923, Bru worked with a redistricting committee 
		to redistribute clubs within districts. The committee needed to consider 
		the explosive growth that was continuing in Rotary due to the chartering 
		of new clubs all over the country and the world. Following 1923, Bru 
		excused himself from further involvement in redistricting clubs, since 
		there was much “trauma” in moving clubs to new districts because of 
		geographical necessities. <br><br>Even today, redistricting becomes 
		necessary as Rotary’s growth throughout the world continues to add new 
		clubs to its rolls. Redistricting is also inevitable when certain areas 
		in Rotary continue to grow rapidly and others lose clubs and members. 
		Redistricting is an unhappy event in Rotary, as personal friendships, 
		made over years of district gatherings, are interrupted when clubs are 
		assigned to new districts.</td>
