		By: Frank Deaver</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">Our subject today is ETHICS. Our 
		subject today is THE FOUR-WAY TEST. Our subject today intends to relate 
		those two subjects more closely to each other.<br><br>As Rotarians, we 
		do not need to be reminded of the content or history of our Four-Way 
		Test. But let’s start with it.<br><br>Of the things we think, say, or 
		do:<br><br>FIRST: Is it the TRUTH?<br>SECOND: Is it FAIR to all 
		concerned?<br>THIRD: Will it build GOODWILL &amp; BETTER FRIENDSHIP?<br>
		FOURTH: Will it be BENEFICIAL to all concerned?<br>Now, keeping those 
		familiar questions in mind, let us explore a bit more carefully the 
		related subject of ethics.<br><br>We are assaulted daily in the media 
		with news about ethics, from the corporate and government sectors in 
		particular, but also from athletics, the behavior of both coaches and 
		athletes. It is not only the questionable ethics of the people in the 
		news, but the ethics of the media in their reporting. In spite of having 
		spent my career in journalism, don’t expect me to be an apologist for 
		sloppy reporting!<br><br>Ethics is defined in various ways, but central 
		to any definition is that ethics is decision-making – decision-making 
		based on individual responsibility for making right decisions. Ethics is 
		not just what is imposed by law, not just what is defined in company 
		policy, not just what is written into a code. Ethics is more than what 
		is expected by civilized society. Ethics rises above each, and all, of 
		those standards. Ethics is the choice to do what is right, not because 
		it is required or expected, but because it is RIGHT. That requires 
		making sometimes hard decisions. But therein is ethics.<br><br>Allow me 
		to take you through some situations, and consideration of some 
		decisions, that will perhaps help us put the Four Way Test to an 
		increasingly meaningful application. Let me first take you on a 
		vicarious trip.<br><br>On your vacation, you and a lifelong friend go to 
		the Great Smoky Mountains on a hiking expedition. On a precarious climb, 
		your friend falls down a steep slope, cracks his skull against a 
		boulder, and lies bleeding and unconscious. You manage to get him back 
		up on the trail, and somehow summon the strength to carry him to your 
		car. You drive him to the nearest town, where there is a small private 
		hospital.<br><br>As you approach the hospital, you recall that your 
		friend is self-employed and has no medical insurance, while you work for 
		a large company and have full coverage with the group. You are concerned 
		that, with no insurance, he might be sent on to a more distant public 
		hospital. So quickly you switch billfolds with your unconscious friend. 
		He is identified by your name, your insurance information goes on the 
		hospital record, and your friend gets the emergency treatment you are 
		convinced he needs.<br><br>A doctor later tells you that he will be 
		fine, but he is very lucky to have such a dedicated friend who got him 
		treated quickly--for without early emergency treatment he almost 
		certainly would have died.<br><br>Now I pose for you a pair of troubling 
		questions.<br><br>First, is truth-telling an absolute principle that 
		should not have been violated, even under such circumstances as these?<br>
		<br>Second, does the end justify the means? Does saving the life of a 
		friend justify the lie, and what amounts to the “stealing” of services?<br>
		<br>On the one hand, we are confronted with principles that could be 
		considered absolute. To lie is wrong. To steal is wrong. But if we do 
		not allow for an exception in this instance, your friend might have 
		died.<br><br>On the other hand, desirable results may tempt us to argue 
		that the end justifies the means. A life was saved because of a 
		misrepresentation and the acquiring of services that otherwise might 
		have been withheld. But if we universalize this justification, we would 
		then be required to agree to many wrongs, even some criminal acts, if it 
		could be argued that some good purpose was served.<br><br>What I have 
		related is a true story. It happened a few years ago to two friends from 
		New Orleans, and they were convicted of theft by deception. But that was 
		in response to the law. In terms of the ethics of our 4WT, how do we 
		balance questions 1. and 4. -- TRUTH and BENEFICIAL?<br><br>What we have 
		introduced - and what we face almost daily in our professions, our 
		businesses, our personal lives - is the classic struggle between two 
		important ethical considerations in our decision-making - principle and 
		pragmatism. Examples are so very common among us that most of them go 
		unrecognized.<br><br>Gentlemen, the lady of your life cuts her hair but 
		you liked it long. She asks your opinion, and you tell her how becoming 
		it is. Or ladies, the man in your life wears a tie you think is ghastly, 
		but you bite your tongue and compliment him on his good taste. In each 
		case, it’s a lie - never mind that it’s classified as a “white” lie - 
		but it’s justified as serving the good cause of keeping good relations. 
		How do we balance Questions 1. and 3. -- TRUTH and GOODWILL?<br><br>Some 
		such examples might be dismissed as flippant and of little serious 
		concern. However, distinctions between principle and pragmatism often 
		take on much more serious consideration in real life. Some very real 
		examples:<br><br>It is unfortunately becoming common for those who 
		violate the law and/or ethics to ride their publicity to fame and 
		fortune – one might say “from shame to riches.” Some who come to mind 
		are G. Gordon Liddy, Monica Lewinsky, and more recently New York Times 
		reporter Jayson Blair.<br><br>The world continues to debate the wisdom 
		of what was called a pre-emptive strike against Saddam Hussein. A 
		long-standing principle holds that a civilized society does not start a 
		war. On the other hand, it was argued that Iraq was stockpiling weapons 
		of mass destruction, and had already demonstrated its willingness to use 
		them. Principle, versus Pragmatism<br><br>Society was conflicted over 
		media showing of the bodies of the dead sons of Hussein. Although such 
		display is generally avoided, it was in this case thought necessary to 
		accomplish the purpose of assuring the Iraqi people that the sons of 
		Saddam were truly no more a menace. More principle versus pragmatism.<br>
		<br>Some few months ago, a team of doctors sought to separate 
		29-year-old twins, congenitally joined at the head. The patients died. 
		Medical ethicists debated whether the doctors were justified in 
		attempting to give them a better life, in spite of the risks. Principle, 
		versus Pragmatism.<br><br>A few years ago, 85 children and their 
		teachers were taken hostage at West End Christian School in my 
		home-town, Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The governor of the state promised in a 
		telephone call and in a videotaped message that if the gunman would come 
		out peacefully without harming the children, he would be granted the 
		press conference he requested and would be pardoned. But when he emerged 
		in response to this promise, he was pinned violently to the ground, 
		handcuffed, and led away to jail, screaming “...but the governor 
		promised....”<br><br>Was the obvious lie justified, in that it resulted 
		in ending the crisis with no physical harm to any of the children? Or 
		were the children taught by demonstration that the authorities are not 
		to be trusted? Do we justify a decision because “it works”? Or do we 
		stand on principle and insist that truth should have been maintained? 
		How shall we balance TRUTH against BENEFICIAL?<br><br>Many states have 
		struggled with controversy over legalized gambling, whether casinos, 
		lotteries, race tracks, or bingo. Many believe that gambling is wrong as 
		a matter of principle. Proponents tout its financial benefits, 
		especially when other revenue sources dry up. Still, if gambling is 
		deemed morally wrong, the justification violates principle. How shall we 
		balance FAIRNESS against BENEFICIAL?<br><br>And perhaps most seriously 
		of all, we are pitting principle against practicality in the matter of 
		human life, both at its beginning and at its ending. Without straying 
		into a debate on the controversies of abortion and assisted death, let 
		me point out the dichotomy that in the heat of emotion is commonly 
		overlooked.<br><br>Those who identify with the “woman’s freedom of 
		choice” position, may in effect say, “If you don’t believe in abortion, 
		don’t have an abortion. But it’s my choice what I believe or do.” This 
		underscores the practicality of individual rights.<br><br>On the other 
		hand, those who identify with the “right-to-life” position argue that as 
		a matter of principle they speak for the unborn, that a woman’s choice 
		deprives another being - the unborn child - of the opportunity for life 
		outside the womb.<br><br>The two sides will likely not ever compromise 
		so long as one appeals to an absolute principle and the other to a 
		practical position.<br><br>At the other end of life, we are caught up in 
		ongoing news of assisted death of the terminally ill, and in debates on 
		when - or even if - it is ever justifiable to pull the plug on life 
		support systems.<br><br>Many hold as a matter of principle that life is 
		forever precious, and that families and doctors have no right to “play 
		God” with the life of another.<br><br>But those faced with prolonged and 
		hopeless suffering may conclude that heroic medical measures are not 
		really preserving life but only demonstrating the ability of modern 
		medical science to maintain bodily functions in what would otherwise be 
		a corpse.<br><br>Again, we are left with a hopeless dilemma that cannot 
		be compromised so long as some appeal to an unbending principle and 
		others to a tempting practicality.<br><br>So it is, fellow Rotarians, 
		that in the examples we have considered, our attempt is to recognize 
		that sometimes principle and practicality clash, and ethics calls on us 
		to seek a process of intelligent decision making.<br><br>Let us come, 
		then, to look at our Rotary Four Way Test in what may be a new and more 
		introspective way. Its four questions appeal to: TRUTH, FAIRNESS, 
		GOODWILL, BENEFICIAL.<br><br>Our credo embraces the best of both 
		principle and pragmatism.<br><br>In the first two questions, we find 
		words of principle. TRUTH. FAIRNESS.<br><br>These principles call us to 
		an apparently unbending dedication to seek truth, to dedicate ourselves 
		to fairness. As ideal expectations, they are not always totally 
		attainable, but they are worthy goals. A Rotarian who does not seek to 
		attain the goals is falling short of the lofty standards idealized in 
		these probing questions.<br><br>The other two questions embrace 
		practicality. GOODWILL. BENEFICIAL.<br><br>These are goals usually 
		attainable through the intelligent application of human reasoning. They 
		call us to practical analysis of actions, seeking the greater good that 
		may result from our decisions.<br><br>The Four-Way Test -- our Code of 
		Ethics – is designed for those who are willing to dedicate themselves – 
		and their businesses – and their professions – and their social 
		positions – all that they are – to the principles and the practicalities 
		that have made Rotary what it is.<br><br>Look around almost any 
		community - your own, for instance - and you will see that civic, 
		social, political, and economic leaders are in large part Rotarians. I 
		submit to you that this is no accident. But it does lay upon our 
		shoulders an added burden of responsibility.<br><br>It has been said 
		that “Leaders do the right thing; managers do things right.” That is a 
		valid definition of ethical leadership. Managers are employed to do the 
		defined things right, in other words to follow. But leaders, in order to 
		do right things, must be the decision makers, those who determine what 
		is right. Rotarians, I repeat, are those leaders.<br><br>The Four-Way 
		Test can serve us as a trusted ethical guide. Through it, we are pointed 
		to the ethics of principle. Through it we are pointed to the ethics of 
		practicality. But as responsible, individual Rotarians, we are trusted 
		to recognize the differences. We are expected to apply both principle 
		and practicality in an ethically mature way.<br><br>It is not enough 
		that we ASK the four questions. It is not enough that we make a decision 
		based on some ONE of the questions. Our Four-Way Test is not only our 
		call to lofty principles, and to beneficial practicality – it is our 
		challenge to combine them in ethically responsible decisions and 
		actions.<br><br>As Rotarians, we cannot content ourselves to be 
		conformists in what may be ethically questionable. Our ethical 
		convictions may bring us to challenge our colleagues, perhaps even 
		challenge a law. Recall that great moral heroes of history are those who 
		were willing to stand for right, often in defiance of society and its 
		norms. We could mention Jesus Christ, Mohammed, Mahatma Ghandi, Martin 
		Luther King, Mother Teresa. They were leaders. They were not 
		conformists.<br><br>Today, we are challenged by our Four Way Test to 
		prove ourselves worthy of the obligations we assumed when we accepted 
		the name that we wear with pride, the name “Rotarian.” To wear that name 
		proudly, we must diligently adhere to principles. We must equally 
		consider practicalities. We must conscientiously answer and balance the 
		questions of our Four Way Test.<br><br>We must, as Rotarians, be visible 
		examples of ethically right conduct. And we are indeed fortunate to have 
		the Four Way Test as our ethical guide.<br><br>Dr. Frank Deaver<br>
