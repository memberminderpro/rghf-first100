		Thompson</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">More than 60 years ago, in the 
		midst of the Great Depression, a U.S. Rotarian devised a simple, 
		four-part ethical guideline that helped him rescue a beleaguered 
		business. The statement and the principles it embodied also helped many 
		others find their own ethical compass. Soon embraced and popularized by 
		Rotary International, The Four-Way Test today stands as one of the 
		organization's hallmarks. It may very well be one of the most famous 
		statements of our century.<br><br>Herbert J. Taylor, author of the Test, 
		was a mover, a doer, a consummate salesman and a leader of men. He was a 
		man of action, faith and high moral principle. Born in Michigan, USA, in 
		1893, he worked his way through Northwestern University in Evanston, 
		Illinois. <br><br>After graduation, Herb went to France on a mission for 
		the YMCA and the British Army welfare service and served in the U.S. 
		Navy Supply Corps in World War I. In 1919, he married Gloria Forbrich, 
		and the couple set up housekeeping in Oklahoma, USA, where he worked for 
		the Sinclair Oil Company. After a year, he resigned and went into 
		insurance, real estate and oil lease brokerage.<br><br>With some 
		prosperous years behind him, Herb returned to Chicago, Illinois, in 1925 
		and began a swift rise within the Jewel Tea Company. He soon joined the 
		Rotary Club of Chicago. In line for the presidency of Jewel in 1932, 
		Herb was asked to help revive the near-bankrupt Club Aluminum Company of 
		Chicago. The cookware manufacturing company owed $400,000 more than its 
		total assets and was barely staying afloat. Herb responded to the 
		challenge and decided to cast his lot with this troubled firm. He 
		resigned from Jewel Tea, taking an 80 percent pay cut to become 
		president of Club Aluminum. He even invested $6,100 of his own money in 
		the company to give it some operating capital.<br><br>Looking for a way 
		to resuscitate the company and caught in the Depression's doldrums, 
		Herb, deeply religious, prayed for inspiration to craft a short 
		measuring stick of ethics for the staff to use.<br><br>As he thought 
		about an ethical guideline for the company, he first wrote a statement 
		of about 100 words but decided that it was too long. He continued to 
		work, reducing it to seven points. In fact, The Four-Way Test was once a 
		Seven-Way Test. It was still too long, and he finally reduced it to the 
		four searching questions that comprise the Test today.<br><br>Next, he 
		checked the statement with his four department heads: a Roman Catholic, 
		a Christian Scientist, an Orthodox Jew and a Presbyterian. They all 
		agreed that the Test's principles not only coincided with their 
		religious beliefs, but also provided an exemplary guide for personal and 
		business life.<br><br>And so, &quot;The Four-Way Test of the things we think, 
		say or do&quot; was born:<br><br>Is it the TRUTH? <br>Is it FAIR to all 
		Concerned? <br>Will it build GOODWILL and BETTER FRIENDSHIPS? <br>Will 
		it be BENEFICIAL to all concerned?<br><br>Profound in its simplicity, 
		the Test became the basis for decisions large and small at Club 
		Aluminum.<br><br>But any test must be put to the test. Would it work in 
		the real world? Could people in business really live by its precepts? 
		One lawyer told Herb: &quot;If I followed the Test explicitly, I would starve 
		to death. Where business is concerned, I think The Four-Way Test is 
		absolutely impractical.&quot;<br><br>The attorney's concerns were 
		understandable. Any ethical system that calls for living the truth and 
		measuring actions on the basis of benefits to others is demanding. Such 
		a test can stir bitter conflict for those who try to balance integrity 
		and ambition. Sizzling debates have been held in various parts of the 
		world on its practicality as a way of living. There are always some 
		serious-minded Rotarians, not to mention skeptics and negative thinkers, 
		who view The Four-Way Test as a simplistic philosophy of dubious worth, 
		contradictory meaning and unrealistic aims. The Test calls for 
		thoughtful examination of one's motives and goals. This emphasis on 
		truth, fairness and consideration provide a moral diet so rich that it 
		gives some people &quot;ethical indigestion.&quot;<br><br>But at Club Aluminum in 
		the 1930s, everything was measured against The Four-Way Test. First, the 
		staff applied it to advertising. Words like &quot;better,&quot; &quot;best,&quot; &quot;greatest&quot; 
		or &quot;finest&quot; were dropped from ads and replaced by factual descriptions 
		of the product. Negative comments about competitors were removed from 
		advertising and company literature.<br><br>The Test gradually became a 
		guide for every aspect of the business, creating a climate of trust and 
		goodwill among dealers, customers and employees. It became part of the 
		corporate culture, and eventually helped improve Club Aluminum's 
		reputation and finances.<br><br>One day, the sales manager announced a 
		possible order for 50,000 utensils. Sales were low and the company was 
		still struggling at the bankruptcy level. The senior managers certainly 
		needed and wanted that sale, but there was a hitch. The sales manager 
		learned that the potential customer intended to sell the products at 
		cut-rate prices. &quot;That wouldn't be fair to our regular dealers who have 
		been advertising and promoting our product consistently,&quot; he said. In 
		one of the toughest decisions the company made that year, the order was 
		turned down. There was no question this transaction would have made a 
		mockery out of The Four-Way Test the company professed to live by.<br>
		<br>By 1937, Club Aluminum's indebtedness was paid off and during the 
		next 15 years, the firm distributed more than $1 million in dividends to 
		its stockholders. Its net worth climbed to more than $2 million.<br><br>
		Too idealistic for the real world? The Four-Way Test was born in the 
		rough and tumble world of business, and put to the acid test of 
		experience in one of the toughest times that the business community has 
		ever known. It survived in the arena of practical commerce.<br><br>In 
		1942, Richard Vernor of Chicago, then a director of Rotary 
		International, suggested that Rotary adopt the Test. The R.I. Board 
		approved his proposal in January 1943 and made The Four-Way Test a 
		component of the Vocational Service program, although today it is 
		considered a vital element in all four Avenues of Service.<br><br>Herb 
		Taylor transferred the copyright to Rotary International when he served 
		as R.I. president in 1954-55, during the organization's golden 
		anniversary.<br><br>Today, more than six decades since its creation, has 
		the Test lost its usefulness in modern society, as some critics 
		maintain? Is it sophisticated enough to guide business and professional 
		men and women in these fast-paced times?<br><br>Is it the TRUTH? There 
		is a timelessness in truth that is unchangeable. Truth cannot exist 
		without justice.<br><br>Is it FAIR to all concerned? The substitution of 
		fairness for the harsh principles of doing business at arm's length has 
		improved rather than hurt business relationships.<br><br>Will it build 
		GOODWILL and BETTER FRIENDSHIPS? Man is by nature a cooperative creature 
		and it is his natural instinct to express love.<br><br>Will it be 
		BENEFICIAL to all concerned? This question eliminates the dog-eat-dog 
		principle of ruthless competition and substitutes the idea of 
		constructive and creative competition.<br><br>The Four-Way Test is 
		international, transcending national boundaries and language barriers. 
		It knows no politics, dogma or creed. More than a code of ethics, it has 
		all the ingredients for a successful life in every way. It can and will 
		work in today's society.<br><br>The final test is in the doing. William 
		James, the noted psychologist, once said, &quot;The ultimate test of what a 
		truth means is the conduct it dictates or inspires.&quot; At the heart of 
		Rotary today is The Four-Way Test — a call to moral excellence. Human 
		beings can grow together. Modern business can be honest and trustworthy. 
		People can learn to believe in one another. At the 1977 R.I. Convention, 
		James S. Fish of the U.S. Better Business Bureaus said, &quot;To endure, the 
		competitive enterprise system must be practiced within the framework of 
		a strict moral code. Indeed, the whole fabric of the capitalistic system 
		rests to a large degree on trust . . . on the confidence that 
		businessmen and women will deal fairly and honestly, not only with each 
		other, but also with the general public, with the consumer, the 
		stockholder and the employee.&quot;<br><br>Few things are needed more in our 
		society than moral integrity. The Four-Way Test will guide those who 
		dare to use it for worthy objectives: choosing, winning, and keeping 
		friends; getting along well with others; ensuring a happy home life; 
		developing high ethical and moral standards; becoming successful in a 
		chosen business or profession; and becoming a better citizen and better 
		example for the next generation.<br><br>Eloquently simple, stunning in 
		its power, undeniable in its results, The Four-Way Test offers a fresh 
		and positive vision in the midst of a world full of tension, confusion 
		and uncertainty.<br><br>Darrell Thompson is a member of the Rotary Club 
		of Morro Bay, California. This article is adapted from a speech given by 
		Darrell, with contributions from Rotarians Douglas W. Vincent of 
		Woodstock-Oxford, Ontario, Canada, and Myron Taylor.</td>
