				<font color="#0066FF" face="Century Gothic" size="2">Tanaka unveiled the RI theme during the opening plenary session 
				of the 2012 International Assembly, a training event for 
				incoming Rotary district governors.&nbsp; &quot;Peace, in all of the ways that we can understand it, is a real 
				goal and a realistic goal for Rotary,&quot; he said. &quot;Peace is not 
				something that can only be achieved through agreements, by 
				governments, or through heroic struggles. </font></p>
				<p><font color="#0066FF" face="Century Gothic" size="2">It is something that 
				we can find and that we can achieve, every day and in many 
				simple ways.&quot; Peace has different meanings for different people, Tanaka 
				said.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No definition is right, and no definition is wrong,&quot; he said. 
				&quot;However we use the word, this is what peace means for us.&nbsp; &quot;No matter how we use, or understand the word,&nbsp;Rotary can help 
				us to achieve it,&quot; he added.&nbsp; </font></p>
				<p><font color="#0066FF" face="Century Gothic" size="2">Tanaka, a businessman from the greater Tokyo metropolitan area, 
				shared how becoming a Rotarian broadened his understanding of 
				the world. After joining the Rotary Club of Yashio, in 1975, he 
				said, he began to realize that his life's purpose was not to 
				make more money, but to be useful to other people.&nbsp; &quot;I realized that by helping others, even in the simplest of 
				ways, I could help to build peace,&quot; Tanaka said.&nbsp;
				</font></p>
				<p><font color="#0066FF" face="Century Gothic" size="2">He noted that the Japanese tradition of putting the needs of 
				society above the needs of the individual helped his country 
				rebuild after the tsunami and earthquake in March.&nbsp; &quot;This is a lesson that I think the whole world can learn from, 
				in a positive way. When we see the needs of others as more 
				important than our own needs -- when we focus our energies on a 
				shared goal that is for the good of all -- this changes 
				everything,&quot; he said. &quot;It changes our priorities in a completely 
				fundamental way. </font></p>
				<p><font color="#0066FF" face="Century Gothic" size="2">And it changes how we understand the idea of 
				peace.&quot;&nbsp; Tanaka will ask Rotarians to focus their energy on supporting 
				the three priorities of the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>RI 
				Strategic Plan, he said. He added that he will ask the incoming 
				leaders to promote three Rotary peace forums, to be held in 
				Hiroshima, Japan; Berlin; and Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. “In Rotary, our business is not profit. Our business is peace,” 
				he said. “Our reward is not financial, but the happiness and 
				satisfaction of seeing a better, more peaceful world, one that 
				we have achieved through our own efforts.”</font></p>

				Good morning.<br>It is a great honor to be here, standing before 
				all of you: our new district governors for the 2012-13 Rotary 
				year.</font></p>
				<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; text-align:justify" class="auto-style7">
				<font face="Century Gothic"><font color="#003399"><br>Rotary has been at the center of my life for many 
				years. I did not know it at the time, but the day I joined 
				Rotary in 1975 was the day I set my first step on the path to a 
				different future.<br><br>
				<img alt="theme1_small_en" class="auto-style5" src="images/theme1_small_en.jpg" style="float: left" width="425" height="450">Before I joined Rotary, my view of the 
				world was narrow. I was the fourth of eight children. We were 
				poor, and so was nearly everyone we knew. I had never met anyone 
				who was not Japanese.<br><br>Every week, I walked with my mother 
				20 kilometers to the market, to sell vegetables. This was as far 
				as I went, and as much as I saw of the world beyond my village.<br>
				<br>I dreamed of travel. I dreamed of seeing other cities, other 
				countries. I wondered what they were like.<br><br>Since then, I 
				have traveled a great deal. I have seen more of the world than I 
				ever imagined. But nothing has broadened my vision as much as 
				the perspective I have gained through Rotary.<br><br>Before I 
				was a Rotarian, I saw only what was in front of me. I saw my 
				business, my family, my customers, and my competitors. When I 
				traveled, I saw only what I knew to look at.<br><br>But I did 
				not see beyond that. I did not look for context. I did not look 
				past what I believed was relevant to me.<br><br>One day, I was 
				asked to join the Rotary Club of Yashio. And it was two years 
				later that someone came and spoke to us about the idea of 
				vocational service. From that day, slowly, I began to change. I 
				realized that the purpose of my life was not just to earn more, 
				to sell more, to make my business better than anyone else’s. I 
				realized that I wanted to have better goals and higher goals — 
				both personally and professionally. I realized that for me, the 
				most important thing in life was being useful to other people.<br>
				<br>And I realized that by helping others, even in the simplest 
				of ways, I could help to build peace.<br><br>We hear the word 
				peace every day. We hear it in the news, we use it in 
				conversation, and we talk about it a great deal in Rotary. But 
				most of us spend very little time thinking about what peace is, 
				and what that word means.<br><br></font><b>
				<font size="5" color="#003399">2</font></b></font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; text-align:justify" class="auto-style7">
				<font color="#003399" face="Century Gothic"><br>On its simplest level, 
				peace can be defined by what it is not. It is a state of no war, 
				no violence, and no fear. It means that you are not in danger of 
				hunger or persecution or the suffering of poverty.<br><br>But we 
				can also define peace by what it is, and by what it can be. 
				Peace can mean freedom of thought and of speech, freedom of 
				opinion and of choice, and the ability for self-determination. 
				It can mean security, confidence in the future: a life and home 
				in a stable society.<br><br>On a more abstract level, peace can 
				mean a sense of happiness, of inner serenity, of calm.<br><br>
				The truth is that peace means different things to different 
				people. No definition is right, and no definition is wrong. 
				However we use the word, this is what peace means for us.<br>
				<br>And however we use the word, however we understand peace, 
				Rotary can help us to achieve it.<br><br>Rotary helps us to meet 
				the basic needs of others: to provide health care, sanitation, 
				food, and education when and where it is most needed.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; text-align:justify" class="auto-style7">
				<font face="Century Gothic"><font color="#003399"><br>It 
				helps to meet the inner needs as well, for friendship, 
				connection, and caring.<br><br>And Rotary helps us to build 
				peace in its most traditional sense, by reducing the causes of 
				conflict. It builds bridges of friendship and tolerance among 
				people and nations. It helps us to understand each other.<br>
				<br>Through our service, we learn that the problems that may 
				seem large to us are really very small. We learn empathy for 
				others. We come closer to people who seem very different from 
				us. And we begin to understand how alike we really are.<br><br>
				Through our Rotary service, we learn that cooperation is more 
				productive than conflict. We learn to value each other, as human 
				beings with human strengths and weaknesses. We learn that every 
				one of us has something to give, and every one has something to 
				teach.<br><br>To me, Service Above Self is more than just a 
				motto. It is a way of life — one that will make any life richer 
				and more meaningful.<br><br>Putting Service Above Self allows us 
				to focus our energies on what is truly important. We put the 
				common good above our own. We prioritize others’ needs over our 
				own desires. We think less about ourselves and more about what 
				is best for everyone. And in this way, we help to build the 
				foundation for a more peaceful world.<br><br>This is why, in 
				2012-13, our Rotary theme will be Peace Through Service.<br><br>
				Because however we define peace, whatever peace means to us, we 
				can bring it closer through service.<br><br></font>

				<font face="Century Gothic"><font size="4" color="#003399"><b><br></b></font>
				<font color="#003399">Service Above 
				Self reminds us that none of us can live for ourselves alone. A 
				life lived in isolation is empty and without joy. But when we 
				live for others — when we focus on our role within our family, 
				our community, and all humanity — then we begin to realize our 
				own place in the world.</font></font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; text-align:justify" class="auto-style7">
				<font face="Century Gothic"><font color="#003399"><br>I am part of the first generation to 
				grow up in Japan after a terrible war. I think it is natural 
				that we now place a great priority on peace. We saw where 
				militarism brought our country. And we also saw the great 
				economic growth that came when our nation made the choice to 
				change our way of thinking, and to embrace peace.<br><br>This 
				was the decision that allowed Japan to grow and thrive. It 
				allowed new generations of children to grow up in safety, to 
				become educated, to improve their lives. It fundamentally 
				changed the Japanese attitude toward other countries and 
				cultures.<br><br>It caused us to open our minds, to become more 
				tolerant, to seek greater understanding.<br><br>And it allowed 
				us to redirect our energies toward positive goals. In Japan, it 
				is traditional to prioritize the needs of the society over the 
				needs of the individual. This has always been part of our 
				culture. In the weeks and months following the great earthquake 
				and disaster of last March, this was what helped us to survive 
				and rebuild.<br><br>This is a lesson that I think the whole 
				world can learn from, in a positive way. When we see the needs 
				of others as more important than our own needs — when we focus 
				our energies on a shared goal that is for the good of all — this 
				changes everything. It changes our perceptions. It changes how 
				we relate to the world. It changes our priorities in a 
				completely fundamental way.<br><br>And it changes how we 
				understand the idea of peace.<br><br>For me, the idea of Peace 
				Through Service does not involve any complicated philosophy. I 
				am not a philosopher. I am a salesman. And over many years of 
				business, I have learned that ultimately, the only way to a 
				successful business is happy customers. When my customers are 
				happy, my business grows. And this makes me happy in turn — not 
				only because my business is doing well, but because I am glad to 
				see that I have made others happy.<br><br>In business and in 
				life, in order to get where you want, you have to know where you 
				are going. In Rotary, we have made the decision to adopt the 
				goals and priorities of the RI Strategic Plan as the roadmap for 
				our organization.<br><br><strong>To support the implementation of the 
				strategic plan, RI will no longer have presidential emphases 
				that change every year. This decision will help us to have 
				greater continuity in our service, and achieve more significant 
				goals over the long term.</strong><br><br>And so, in 2012-13, I will ask 
				you to focus the energies of your clubs on the three priorities 
				of the RI Strategic Plan: to support and strengthen clubs, to 
				focus and increase humanitarian service, and to enhance public 
				image and awareness.<br><br></font>

				<font color="#003399" face="Century Gothic"><br>I will ask you also to help 
				promote the three Rotary global peace forums that we will be 
				holding in Hiroshima, Berlin, and Honolulu. You will be learning 
				more about these important events during this assembly. I hope 
				that many of you will become involved and make it a priority to 
				attend.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; text-align:justify" class="auto-style7">
				<font face="Century Gothic"><font color="#003399"><br>In Rotary, our business is not profit. Our business
