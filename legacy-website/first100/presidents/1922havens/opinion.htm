		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">By Raymond M. Havens<br><br>Past 
		President of Rotary International and Chairman of the Business Methods 
		Committee<br><br>WHAT is the weak point of Rotary?<br><br>Is there a 
		fade&#8209;away element in its make&#8209;up, from which it will perish, if it 
		perishes? You know what I mean. But let's put it in plain words, I mean 
		the weakness which tends to reduce Rotary to mere good fellowship, to 
		leave it an organization without a basic or fundamental cause.<br><br>
		Most incredible, the unfortunate thing, is that thousands of Rotary club 
		members do not know what Rotary really means. Is the physical 
		organization, Rotary? Is the Government, America? Does civilization 
		consist in the government, the law&#8209;makers, the law&#8209;enforcers, the social 
		censors? Or does civilization consist in the civilized state of mind of 
		individuals?<br><br>This opinion ran across the page from one by Rotary 
		Founder Paul P. Harris.<br><br>Never has there been such a multiplicity 
		of organizations, associations, societies, leagues to reform and set 
		right every imaginable thing. All of them have a certain more or less 
		similar form. Each have a few active members, who break into print and 
		claim to speak for a vast following. Is Rotary International one of 
		these? No, certainly not, it is entirely different. It is the very 
		opposite.<br><br>Rotary International has its organized leadership, its 
		organized machinery; but this leadership and this machinery are for the 
		purpose of inspiring its members to keep the faith of Rotary. Rotary is 
		a body that works through its membership as individuals.<br><br>The 
		faith of Rotary is individual responsibility.<br><br>Where and how is 
		the Rotary faith to be kept and practiced? Nothing could be more simple. 
		The place is your own daily business, the time is now, and the way to do 
		it is simply to realize that there is no such thing as passive, inactive 
		good character.<br><br>Some other manufacturer trimmed the cost by using 
		a material he would not tell his customers he uses? He makes a larger 
		profit. Are you therefore, justified in doing likewise?<br><br>You have 
		a number of men working for you, to whom you have never said as much as 
		&quot;good morning.&quot; Wouldn't it be more human to make occasional rounds of 
		your own shop or office and get into personal touch with your men and 
		associates than to pay a social worker to make proxied visits?<br><br>Do 
		you sometimes tell your typist that you must have those letters 
		finished, and when they are finished, let them lie over until next week, 
		because they are unimportant, while the girl sees red and green and 
		blue, but tries to smile.<br><br>That's a great advertisement the young 
		advertising writer concocted. If he had known more about the goods, 
		perhaps he would not have written with such enthusiasm. Almost a case 
		for the Better Business Bureau. Well, you say, they don't know, or will 
		not dare to kick. And the advertisement sure has the punch, Let it ride. 
		There are worse mis&#8209;statements getting by. Thus we seek to justify our 
		action. But we fool few people &#8209; least of all ourselves.<br><br>Business 
		is the everyday, universal, never&#8209;ceasing aggregate of actions, small 
		and big, trifling and important, forming an intricacy of life in which 
		every individual is more or less similar; and Rotary means that, here 
		and there, an individual shall stand out as an example: There is a man!<br>
		<br>WHAT constitutes a first&#8209;class, decent, loyal upstanding man and 
		citizen? Why does he stand out? Not because he is a member of Rotary, 
		but because he has character.<br><br>Character goes beyond qualities of 
		mind; it exceeds what we call individuality. Character is the spirit of 
		the man &#8209; plus the state of mind springing from intelligence, education, 
		experience, and moral conviction; and, above all, character demonstrates 
		itself by action. Certainly, it cannot demonstrate itself by inaction. 
		There is no such thing as passive good character.<br><br>So when we ask 
		the question, &quot;What is Rotary?&quot; we can well answer it in these terms:<br>
		<br>It is the character of the individual Rotarian. It is the character 
		of the men who profess and practice Rotary in all of their daily 
		contacts.<br><br>It is the great need of the modern world. In this way, 
		the purposes and objects of Rotary are to be gained, if they are gained, 
		at all, by the influence of Rotary principles on the business morality 
		of a community. Not by speeches, but by deeds, daily, hourly deeds.<br>
		<br>This is the mighty difference between the organization of Rotary and 
		the organizations that are the spear&#8209;heads of a cause. The cause of 
		Rotary is to raise up men to practice honor, human feeling, good will, 
		sympathy in the office and the shop, the factory and the store. It is 
		idealism put into practical effect. It is business chivalry. Not in 
		words but in the individual's acts. He, himself, is the cause.<br><br>In 
		its hey&#8209;day, chivalry furnished an object lesson to the world which 
		still exists in figures of speech and terms of action. Why? Because 
		chivalry was practiced by individual knights errant, and it was only 
		when it passed into forms of social organization and titles and tenure 
		of office, that it became a sham and perished.<br><br>Likewise, when 
		Rotary fails to be the Rotarian himself; when it becomes a name, an 
		organization, doing what other organizations do, supporting this or that 
		good thing outside of the inner business life; when it becomes 
		neglectful of the personal business arena in which each Rotarian must 
		prove himself &#8209; that is, his own office, or shop &#8209; then Rotary, instead 
		of qualifying to be the chivalry of business, will become a sham, a 
		pretense, and deserve the oblivion of disuse. Herein lies the weakness 
		of Rotary.<br><br>Finally, how do we know this weakness of Rotary is 
		being felt? How do we know that there are Rotarians who put on Rotary 
		like a coat when they go to the meetings, and take it off like a coat, 
		when they return to their places of business? We know it because of the 
		constant disposition to take up something to boost Rotary, to get 
		publicity. I heard a good brother measure the good of his club by the 
		columns of newspaper space.<br><br>We know it because &#8209; I hate to say 
		it, but I must say it, for I wish to make this so plain that it will 
		hurt &#8209; we know it because the men on the street, the men in any certain 
		trade, do not appear to always regard Rotary membership in itself as 
		evidence of squareness and integrity. They think that Rotary is all 
		right, the Rotarians are good men &#8209; they have to be, or they can't 
		become members &#8209; but they are good men like many other good men, no 
		better than it pays.<br><br>The spirit of Rotary, like the spirit of 
		chivalry, is the rightness of the act, not the cost of the act. The 
		payment is spiritual. Your acts make you a Rotarian. It makes other men 
		realize that you are a Rotarian. By this code and no other; by the 
		application of this code of business, not the other fellow's business 
		but your own business; only in this way will Rotary stand forth as the 
		escutcheon of the strong man, the brave man, the gallant business man, 
		who, in the end, must uphold this civilization, or it will crash on our 
		heads, burying good and bad in one common ruin.</td>
