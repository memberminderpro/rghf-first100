		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">Just as it was in the beginning 
		Paul Harris’ business and social club moved about with their meetings 
		and that is why he named his club Rotary. Originally, “The Boys”, as 
		Paul called the members, would meet in each other’s offices on a 
		rotating basis. Not too long after those first meetings took place in 
		members’ offices, the meetings evolved to having dinner in a hotel and 
		the holding of their business meeting took place in one of the hotel’s 
		rooms<br><br>Since minutes of the early meetings were not recorded, the 
		early history of the organization was so sketchy that the early history 
		is somewhat contradictory.<br><br>The first official location of the 
		Rotary Club of Chicago’s office was in a single room at the Sherman 
		House (Where the Illinois State office building is currently located). 
		Their meetings were also held at the Sherman House for the next 61 
		years. While the Sherman House was the official meeting location over 
		those 61 years it was necessary to move meetings from time to time.<br>
		<br>Madame Galli’s restaurant, just north of the river, was a long time 
		favorite of “The Boys” especially in the beginning. While many hotels 
		and restaurants were used over the years, the most used outside of the 
		Sherman House was the Morrison Hotel in the middle of the Loop.<br><br>
		The demise of the Sherman House was well known but took several years 
		before the doors actually closed. The Rotary offices were the last to 
		move from the Sherman House and that took place in September of 1973 
		when the offices were moved to the LaSalle Hotel at 10 North Madison.<br>
		<br>During the next three years only a few of the Club’s meetings had to 
		be held outside of the LaSalle Hotel and one of those meetings was hold 
		on the stage of the theater at 20 North Wacker.<br><br>In 1976, after 
		the Fleetwood Realty Corporation had purchased the LaSalle Hotel from 
		the world famous Avery Brundage, plans were being made to shut down the 
		hotel and to replace it with a new office building, Once again 
		ROTARY/One was looking for a new home, In October of 1976 ROTARY/One 
		moved into its new offices on the Lobby Floor of the Sheraton Chicago 
		Hotel at 505 North Michigan Avenue. Several of the hotel’s function 
		rooms were available to the Club but most meetings were held in their 
		Grand Ballroom.<br><br>Even though the Hotel changed names three times 
		(Radisson Hotel in March 1978 and Continental Hotel in November of 984) 
		ROTARY/one remained in their same offices on the Lobby Floor. Luncheon 
		meetings also remained at the same location except for a six-month 
		period when the luncheon meetings were moved to the Holiday Inn atop the 
		Fashion Mart on the Chicago River. The Continental Hotel on a moments 
		notice had increased the luncheon costs to the Rotary Club and 
		ROTARY/One did not accept the increase and moved the luncheon meetings 
		to the Holiday Inn.<br><br>The Club’s luncheon meetings were moved back 
		to the Continental Hotel after six months because the Hotel made several 
		concessions, one of which was putting the price of the luncheon meetings 
		back to the original price before the increase.<br><br>Once again 
		ROTARY/One was forced to find new offices and meeting place because the 
		Continental Hotel was closing down to be renovated and become the 
		Intercontinental Hotel.<br><br>After having considered numerous offers, 
		ROTARY/One moved their offices and meeting place to the Chicago Athletic 
		Association in December of 1986. The offices were first located on the 6 
		floor and later were moved to the location on the 5 floor. ROTARY/One 
		moved to the Union League Club at 65 W. Jackson Blvd. July 1, 2005 and 
		currently has all meetings there, commencing at 12:10 P.M. every 
		Tuesday.<br><br>No matter where the Rotary Club of Chicago has hung out 
		its sign, Rotarians from around the world have beaten a path to its 
		ROTARY/One Door.</td>
