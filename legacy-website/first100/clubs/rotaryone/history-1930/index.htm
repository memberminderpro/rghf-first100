		generally accepted as the evening of February 23, 1905, when four 
		businessmen met at a Chicago office building. What we know as Rotary 
		emerged. In the February 1931 issue of The Rotarian, in honor of the 
		anniversary month of the founding of Rotary, Rotary general secretary 
		Ches Perry elucidates “A Page from Rotary Global History.” Since the 
		early leaders did not set out to found a worldwide organization, and 
		subsequently change the world, no minutes were kept of the early 
		meetings. In 1930, the Chicago club, as a part of its 25th anniversary, 
		decided to issue a statement on the original purposes of Rotary. Perry, 
		who joined in 1908, and was then the general secretary of Rotary 
		International, helped compile the statement, which was approved by 
		ROTARY/One in May 1930. 
		He felt that February 1931, in honor of Rotary’s 
		next anniversary, would be the appropriate time to release that 
		statement. It follows. Doug Rudman<br><br>A Page from Rotary Global 
		History<br>By Chesley R. Perry<br>Secretary of Rotary International<br>
		<br><br>
		THE Rotary Club of Chicago has a committee at work in the endeavor 
		to prepare a history of the club. This committee has held a number of 
		meetings at the home of Rufus F. Chapin, treasurer of Rotary 
		International and one of the 1905 members of the Chicago Rotary Club. No 
		minutes of the earliest meetings of the club appear to be in existence.<br>
		<br>An examination was made of all the available literature of the early 
		days of the club. Then all those now living who belonged to the club in 
		1905 and 1906 (whether they are now members or not) were interrogated so 
		far as possible either personally or by correspondence. Memories were 
		found to be faulty, particularly in regard to places and dates of 
		meetings, and pending the development of further evidence in regard to 
		these matters, it was decided to report first a statement as to what was 
		the purpose of the club or the character of the club at the time of its 
		founding and immediately thereafter. As to this there was found to be a 
		substantial agreement.<br><br>This report when made was wholly 
		subscribed to by a majority of the committee and of the 1905-1906 
		members, and subscribed to with reservations or comments by several 
		others. It was submitted to the Chicago Rotary Club and adopted by the 
		club as a correct and fair statement as to the character of the club at 
		its founding and immediately thereafter. It is supported by the first 
		Constitution and By-Laws and other literature used by the club in its 
		earliest years. The statement as adopted by the Chicago Rotary Club,

		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19"  width: 50%>1. Whatever may have been the 
		exact thought, if there was an exact thought, in the mind of Paul 
		Harris, when he made an explanation of his plan to the other three men 
		who sat with him in the first preliminary meeting, whatever may have 
		been in the Silvester Schiele, Paul's client and friendminds of 
		Silvester Schiele, (left), Harry Ruggles, (below right), Will Jenson, 
		Charlie Newton, (below left), and others who joined in the early days, 
		it is undoubtedly true that the early meetings were largely experimental 
		in their character and the various members, according to their points 
		Harry Ruggles, the fifth Rotarianof view, found fellowship, business 
		benefits, fun, or whatever most appealed to them in the club.<br><br>2. 
		As has been stated by Paul Harris, it was his purpose to organize a 
		fellowship of business and professional men in the large Charlie 
		Newtoncity of Chicago whereby they could have the advantage of 
		acquaintance and friendship and business opportunities such as men in a 
		small community ordinarily have.<br><br>Friendliness and good fellowship 
		prevailed in the new club from the beginning, but the unique purpose of 
		the club was for the members to give and to influence business to, and 
		to get business from, fellow-members and persons influenced by them.<br>
		<br>It took direct issue with social clubs and other institutions 
		wherein it was considered dishonorable or unethical to belong for 
		business purposes. No such taboo existed in the Rotary club. It was 
		declared to be a business club and that it therefore was proper to join 
		it for business purposes.<br><br>3. However, although the inducement 
		given to get a man to join usually was the promise of how much business 
		benefit he would get from' his membership in the club, it was very early 
		agreed that the best exemplar of the Rotary idea was not the one who was 
		trying to get all he could out of his fellow members, but the one who 
		was trying to be of the greatest helpfulness to his fellow members.<br>
		<br>4. Furthermore, a direct exchange of business between any two 
		members was not required. For example, &quot;A&quot; might be able to give 
		business to &quot;B&quot; without being situated so as to receive any return from 
		&quot;B,&quot; but &quot;B&quot; might be able to do something of value for &quot;C,&quot; and &quot;C&quot; in 
		turn might be able to patronize &quot;A.&quot; This was called the rotation of 
		business. Therefore, as each Rotarian undertook to help his 
		fellow-Rotarians, without demanding a direct return to him from them, 
		there was produced a condition of altruistic endeavor, which lifted the 
		members above or out of the usual selfish attitude of commercial 
		relations.<br><br>5. Notwithstanding the spirit of altruism with regard 
		to one's membership in the club, it soon become evident that in the 
		opinion of the outside community, the club was regarded as a 
		self-centered organization in that the good deeds of its members were 
		all done for fellow-members of the club. Consequently, perhaps partly to 
		quiet criticisms from the outside, and partly because some members of 
		the club really had a desire to render a service to others besides those 
		who belonged to the club, an effort was made to engage in civic and 
		charitable work.<br><br>6. The membership originally was limited to one 
		executive from each occupation in order that each member might have all 
		the opportunity to obtain all the business benefit that might come from 
		representing his line of business in the club. After a while it was seen 
		that while the membership was limited, the method of limiting it created 
		a very representative group of business and professional men, and 
		therefore an ideal assembly for the consideration and discussion of 
		public affairs and of matters pertaining to business in general.<br><br>
		7. To summarize the original purposes of the Rotary Club of Chicago, it 
		may be said that, as is shown in the first stated objects, the first 
		purpose was the promotion of the business interests of its members. The 
		methods used to accomplish this purpose were:<br><br>(a) By affording 
		opportunity to its members to explain their business and display their 
		wares at club meetings.<br><br>(b) By constantly emphasizing to its 
		members that any man engaged in a reputable calling should receive the 
		patronage and support of his friends in the conduct of his business.<br>
		<br>(c) By steadily encouraging the practice of actually doing for the 
		other fellow as we would like to have him do for us.<br><br>8. The 
		second purpose of the club was the development of an intimate, personal 
		acquaintanceship, a friendly fellowship, and the play spirit among its 
		members.<br><br>9. An additional feature or by-product early developed 
		was the enlightenment of a member as to businesses other than his own, 
		thereby making him a broader business man.<br><br>10. A year or so after 
		the founding of the club, a third purpose was developed which was the 
		enlightenment of its members with regard to, and the participation of 
		its members in, public affairs or community welfare work, thereby making 
		each member a better citizen.<br><br>The foregoing report was approved 
		by the Rotary Club of Chicago in May 1930, and therefore stands as an 
		official statement of the purposes of the Rotary Club of Chicago during 
		the earliest years of its existence.</td>
