		<img alt="File:USS Lexington.jpg" class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/rotaryone/historian/images/USS_Lexington_small.jpg" style="float: left"></a>Late March 1941, a day or two remained on my first Navy 
		leave. I graduated as a Navy Ensign on the 14th with orders to USS 
		Lexington CV2 in Pearl Harbor. Since ten years old in 1927, I had 
		followed the exploits of that ship from launching, through its knocking 
		down the light poles along the Panama canal to the search for Amelia 
		Earhart. I asked for a carrier. The Navy just happened to assign me to 
		my favorite ship. <br><br>My friends in Midshipman School asked why I 
		wanted a carrier? &quot;You will never see action.&quot; Until a few months before 
		I enlisted, 7 August 1940, the Navy policy called for the Saratoga CV3 
		and Lexington CV2 sending off their planes into battle, then with their 
		8&quot; popguns, join the 12&quot;, 14&quot;, and 16&quot; guns in the battle line. What a 
		spot, the Navy’s largest ships with the smallish guns up against the big 
		boys on the other side. An Air Admiral, probably Halsey, put the 
		carriers back behind a screen. Supposedly, that made us completely safe.
		<br><br>A Rookie Rotarian<br><br>With my leave short, my father, a 
		Charter Member of the small Shelby, Michigan Rotary Club, spoke to me 
		about joining the club as an Honorary Member. We walked a block down to 
		the club Secretary´s commercial establishment. Without the benefit of 
		the Board’s OK, I became a Rotarian. It took a matter of minutes. The 
		Secretary gave me a pin and a card, &quot;NAVEL (sic) RESERVE&quot;. I did not 
		notice that until the San Pedro, California club Secretary asked me to 
		reserve a few for him. Since 8 May 1942, those keepsakes have lain on 
		bottom in the Coral Sea, still aboard LEXCV2.<br><br>Many clubs stick 
		very closely to protocol. Under ordinary circumstances, my chances of 
		joining Rotary would have been iffy. My most obvious successes had 
		occurred out of town at the very tough Muskegon, Michigan Junior college 
		and The University of Chicago. Those schools had few local admirers. 
		Neither played football. Most probably my father’s status and clout in 
		town would have given me the membership. However, &quot;haste was of the 
		essence&quot;. A delay could have eliminated the &quot;Dick&quot; episode in the next 
		section. Some of my benefit , and I humbly submit, some of Rotary’s 
		would have been lost..<br><br>Tom, Dick and Harris<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style27" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/rotaryone/historian/images/1944wells.jpg" style="float: left">Mid-April, 
		we arrived in Pearl Harbor, 176 boot Ensigns crowded into the old, 
		stuffy, starboard listing USS Henderson. LEX had sailed for a week of 
		practice. That left me with a week of wandering. My Rotary handbook 
		noted a meeting in Honolulu that day. They met in the Moana Hotel on 
		Waikiki beach. I had no trouble getting there. Walking in, I found the 
		Rotary District Convention going full tilt. They were talking about 
		getting in touch with teen age boys. At the time, Rotary had not 
		prettied itself up. <br><br>As the youngest of the lot, I got up and 
		chattered. My advice centered on games. If Rotarians could sponsor or 
		aid in baseball, tennis, surfing or any other sport, they had an in for 
		other matters. Leo Rodby, the District Secretary, was so impressed, he 
		asked me to join the Board in their after the meeting duties. The next 
		day, he took me deep sea fishing. We became very good friends for the 
		rest of his short life. Until last year, my wife and I kept in contact 
		with at least one of the Rodby family. <br><br>&quot;Because of Speaker’s 
		Table over population, the Keynote Speaker
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1944wells/index.htm">
		Dick Wells</a>, RI President 1944-45, asked if Mrs. Wells could sit at 
		my table. Of course! She proved to be a delightful companion. But why 
		me? A rookie. Why not someone more mature in Rotary? <br><br>Dick made a 
		stirring Keynote Speech. In his two year stint as a Mormon Missionary in 
		Hawaii, he had learned the Hawaiian language. In several places, he 
		broke into a paragraph of Hawaiian. I am sure very few in the audience 
		could translate. Perhaps not even Honolulu Club member Duke Kahanomoku 
		the Oahu sheriff. Yet, few missed the meaning. Dick was good. <br><br>
		<img alt="Davis" class="auto-style27" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/rotaryone/historian/images/davis[1].gif" style="float: left">June 
		1942, we LEX survivors pulled into San Diego. The Rotary Club had a very 
		attractive 33 year old general secretary. I told her about Dick having 
		Mrs. Wells sitting with me rather than an older, more important 
		Rotarian. She laughed, &quot;He knew what he was doing. You have not made a 
		hit on me. But, 45 year old Rotarians chase me around the desk&quot; That 
		surprised me, because she was engaged to the San Diego Chief of Police.
		<br><br>Davis In June 1943, while home on hospital leave, I attended the 
		1943 Rotary International Convention for the Shelby Club. I wore my 
		uniform. Entering the Hall, a man came up to me. He introducing himself 
		as
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1941davis/index.htm">
		Tom Davi</a>s the 1942-43 RI President. <br><br>He asked me, &quot;My 
		daughter is here without her husband. Would you escort her to the RI 
		Board’s party this evening?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes! I would be honored.&quot; <br><br>
		Then, Tom looked more closely and said, &quot;We know each other.&quot;<br><br>
		&quot;No, we have never met&quot;. <br><br>Then, he added, &quot;Was your father at the 
		University of Michigan 1910 to 1912?&quot; He was.<br><br>

		spite of knowing my father as a young college boy, he did not renege on 
		his invitation.<br><br>I had a very good time. Although Tom was a 
		teetotaler, he bought me a scotch and water, or …perhaps two. I can also 
		remember the outgoing President,
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1942carbajal/index.htm">
		Fernando Carbajal</a>, kidding the Ohio delegates about their 
		mispronouncing LIMA. And, my date was a good conservationist. <br><br>

		Carlos Romulo, George Fitch, Me -- At the 1943 Rotary International 
		Convention<br><br>Carlos served as Key Note Speaker. Paul said George 
		worked to start Chinese Rotary.<br><br>PerryHarrisOn 1 July, 1944, the 
		Navy retired me for permanent disabling injuries in the Coral Sea 
		Battle. That gave me a chance to return to the University of Chicago as 
		a Senior. I got in on the opening of the GI Bill. Still having my Rotary 
		card, I attended about a dozen meeting that Rotary year, when Ches Perry 
		served as the ROTARY/One President.. One day, my good friend Paul Pair 
		grabbed me as I came into the Sherman House. He exclaimed, &quot;Paul Harris 
		is here today&quot; The Founder lived almost into the Chicago suburbs. With 
		only two or three years of life left, he rarely endured the long trip 
		into the Loop. <br><br>We went over to a large round table. Paul 
		introduce me to Paul. Although, he looked quite frail, he had a steady 
		voice and a firm hand shake. He asked me several questions about my war 
		experiences and how Rotarians treated the veterans. &quot;Very well&quot; I told 
		him. Then, he introduced the seven or eight others at the table. 
		Several, although not all, asked me more questions. How, I wish I had 
		known more about the Rotary Pioneers. That would have really helped in 
		my recent research. But, youth must learn first in order to judge what 
		is important. <br><br>

		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1938hager/index.htm">
		George Hager</a> RI President 1938-39 among others. <br><br>The endeavor 
		in that Rotary year which gave me the most club notice was as speaker at 
		the New Members Banquet along with the Club President Ches Perry. I can 
		not remember Ches saying anything to me. Or, shaking my hand. And, I do 
		not know how well I did. The only thing I can say, &quot;After 61 years, the 
		Club again gave me the speaker’s microphone.&quot; <br><br>A Conflicted 
		Interlude <br><br>One week before 7 December 1941, Admiral Halsey 
		ordered the two Pearl Harbor carriers, Lexington CV2 and Enterprise CV6 
		to Midway and Wake respectfully. They would deliver the LEX’s Marine 
		fighter and bombing squadrons. Big E started for Wake immediately. 
		Installing our new radar, kept us tied up in the Navy Yard. We planed on 
		leaving 8 December. A miracle happened, our navy yard work ended two 
		days early. We set out almost immediately. <br><br>On Sunday, 200 miles 
		off Midway, we went to flight quarters about 0800 Midway time. A few 
		minutes later, general quarters sounded. I hurried to my turret #3, one 
		those 8&quot; pop guns, I talked of earlier. (One hundred ten pounds of 
		smokeless powder could throw a 165 pound projectile 15 miles. The 16&quot; 
		used a 2500 pound projectile.) The bridge told us we were at war. Going 
		back to my watch station, I saw the Admiral’s message. It said &quot;Turn 
		south, full speed, intercept, engage&quot;. We had one carrier, 3 cruisers 
		and 6 cans (destroyers). They had 6 carriers and many support ships. The 
		Japanese went north, we steamed south. Thank you, those who made the 
		directions decisions. <br><br>On 20 February, we started a bombing raid 
		on Rabaul, New Britain. Spotting us, the Japanese sent out 9 Mitsubishi 
		97s. Our squadrons shot them down beyond our sight. Then, our planes 
		came in to refuel, leaving only 4 fighters at the corners. Another 
		flight of 97s came in. With only 1 fighter in their path, the fight 
		almost reached us. I saw all of that skirmish. Butch O’Hare shot down 5 
		and damaged another before running out of ammunition. The damaged plane 
		nearly crashed us. In a couple of days, Butch left us to receive the 
		Medal of Honor, to sell War bonds and have a large air port named after 
		him. Later, Butch flew out one night from Enterprise and never returned.
		<br><br>
		<img alt="ship" class="auto-style27" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/rotaryone/historian/images/img10.gif" style="float: left">Yorktown 
		CV5 joined us in early April. Our planes made a joint raid over the Owen 
		Stanly Mountains in New Guinea. Without much opposition, we caused 
		considerable havoc. Then, leaving Yorktown, we returned to Pearl. There 
		we remove the turrets, replacing them with small AA. I took command of 
		the battery that shot down the plane Butch had damaged. In the picture 
		of us abandoning the ship, that battery at far starboard aft shows up 
		clearly. <br><br>Again joining Yorktown in early May, we started looking 
		for the Japanese fleet. On 7 May, we heard one of our pilots yell 
		&quot;Scratch one flat top.&quot; We had sunk their smallest carrier. We missed 
		their two large carriers, in rain squalls. Nor did they did they find us 
		for the same reason. <br><br>The 8th arrived clear. By mid morning, our 
		scouts had spotted the Japanese 200 miles away. At a quarter after 1100 
		the Japanese Torpedo planes arrived. We took two fish. The lighter, more 
		nibble Yorktown escaped. <br><br>Shortly, the dive bombers arrived at 
		15,000 feet. Each pealed off, coming down at increasing speed. Well 
		below practice heights, they released their bombs. Each bomb started 
		tumbling toward us. No one knew where they would land. The bombs and 
		planes lit at the same time. They lost every dive bomber. An officer, 
		near my battery, counted seven bombs missing our battery by about 25 
		feet. They really rattled our cage. A couple of bomb splashes cascaded 
		upon us. Water is heavy. Two bombs hit the ship. One wiped out an entire 
		Marine 5&quot; AA battery. The other hitting in the stack killed my Division 
		officer, my best friend, a great officer. Yorktown took one hit, 
		requiring the emergency navy yard in Pearl, before the Midway Battle. 
		The action took 16 minutes. It went so fast, it seemed surreal. <br><br>
		On the other side, our planes made three hits on Shokaku. One bomb badly 
		damaged the flight deck elevator, putting it out of action. We lost the 
		Zuikaku in a rain squall. Losing all of their dive bombers, put them out 
		of action for several weeks. The Japanese trained their pilots on their 
		assigned ships. Neither carrier could take part in the Midway battle, 
		much to our advantage. We trained our rookie pilots on great Lakes ships 
		out of Glenview, Illinois Navy. <br><br>After the all clear, I left my 
		top enlisted man in charge and went below to help. I had asked Boats, if 
		he would like to go instead. He said &quot;No, I am afraid of what I would 
		see.&quot; He was right. <br><br>Reaching two decks below, an explosion that 
		stopped the ship knocked me out and threw me some distant. Eventually, I 
		found it had badly damaged my spine at the 1st lumbar. Because of that 
		injury, I now pilot a wheel chair. <br><br>ship<br><br>The crew 
		abandoning the cripple LEXCV2, my AA battery far starboard aft.<br><br>
		As the heat spreading to our metal gun tub became too uncomfortable, we 
		moved to the insulating teak wood flight deck. Before the flames reached 
		the coolers, some of my enlisted men liberated a gallon of vanilla ice 
		cream and utensils. They handed the lot over to me. Temporarily, I 
		became a soda jerk, rather than the ordinary kind.<br><br>Because of the 
		confusion, I did not feel anything for several days, while retreating on 
		an horribly overloaded destroyer, USS Aylwin DD355. When reaching Tonga 
		Tabu, I could relax. Also, I found a brother’s ship USS Richman LC9 in 
		the harbor, with whom to relax. Over the next four months, the pain and 
		leg paralysis gradually worsened. Thinking it would subside, I continued 
		at sea in an old WWI destroyer USS Alden DD211. The injury had also 
		affected my eyes. I could no longer use a sextant. <br><br>On 1 December 
		1942, my skipper denied me a promotion to LT. (34 years later the Navy 
		gave me that promotion with all back pay. To show our wonderful pay, it 
		amounted to $15,000.) I refused to sign the papers, before seeing a 
		doctor. Trying to find a more congenial billet, I tried 
		Lighter-Than-Air. Their doctor examined me and laughed, &quot;I know why you 
		are trying to get off that old rust bucket, but you can not pass any 
		Navy physical exam.&quot; Finally, I went to Mare Island Naval Hospital in 
		the first week of 1943. <br><br>Naval Hospital Shenanigans<br><br>You 
		have heard of the atrocious treatment many of our wounded Middle Eastern 
		War veterans receive at the present time. In 1943, I had the same type 
		of treatment meted out. I asked a medical corpsman in the USS Whipple 
		DD217 to give me the request for hospitalization. The Alden corpsman did 
		not know how. Because of my occipital location head pains, the Whipple 
		sailor inserted the diagnosis &quot;Frontal Lobe Pathogenesis&quot;. He did not 
		know what it meant. At the time, surgeons cured it with lobotomies. I 
		told him that was wrong, take it out. He left it in. <br><br>Getting the 
		request, Mare Island Naval Hospital sent me to their Chief Psychiatrist 
		a Commander. After a thorough exam, he said &quot;This is not mental, but a 
		very serious trauma. Get in here right away.&quot; Then, he added, &quot;I am 
		transferring tomorrow, so I can’t help you.&quot; I wondered about that 
		remark. <br><br>The Head of the officer’s section, called me into his 
		office the next day. He opened, &quot;As a Reserve, the Navy has no 
		responsibility for you. Sign these waivers and return to civilian life.&quot; 
		I told him, &quot;NO! Send me back to active duty.&quot; <br><br>A day after first 
		entering Mare Island Naval Hospital, the very famous Captain &quot;Dixie&quot; 
		Kiefer came into my room. He told me &quot;Do not sign any papers, the Navy 
		has to retire you.&quot; As the Exec in Yorktown, he had seen LEX explode.<br>
		<br>I told him I had asked for further active duty. <br><br>He answered, 
		&quot;You will not get it.&quot; <br><br>The section head could not send me back, 
		as my next physical would have exposed his game. After four or five 
		months, they dumped me as a problem on others. They sent me on a private 
		hospital car, with four others destined for St. Elizabeth asylum. I went 
		to Bethesda Naval Hospital as a lesser loony. <br><br>Within a week, 
		Bethesda knew they had a sane, badly injured individual on their hands. 
		But, that did not change my treatment. After much leave, about 
		Thanksgiving they sent me to a Retiring Board. These officers believed 
		me. They retired me at pay and grade. I knew young enlisted men could be 
		fooled, but why did they think they could pull that same scam on an 
		experience officer? <br><br>Eventually, I received my medical report. 
		The section Head had tried to erase the Commander’s diagnosis and hand 
		wrote in the enlisted man’s fancy. And, my spinal injury showed up as 
		Spina Bifida Occulta. I remember some political opponents of President 
		Kennedy declaring that the Navy retired him for Spina Bifida. Implying 
		the SB diagnosis to JFK, me or any other active military individual is 
		outright ridiculous. Navy retired our Exec, who was walking just to my 
		right at the time of the explosion. He suffered almost the identical 
		injury to mine. His retirement went through without a hint of SB or any 
		of the other BS. <br><br>The replacement Psychiatrist, a short course 
		specialist with a weird psycho background, put me down as 
		Manic-depressive without seeing me. He arrived, while I was on leave in 
		Michigan. About 40 other errors (fantasies) graced my medical report. A 
		Rear Admiral, on my Retirement Board, called the report &quot;unbelievable&quot; 
		The Navy retired me 1 July 1944, stating &quot;… (the Navy) found that you 
		are incapacitated for active service by reason of physical disability; 
		that your disability is permanent, and is the result of an incident of 
		the service.&quot; <br><br>After my retirement, Great Lakes Naval Hospital 
		fitted me with a body brace. It had a steel rod the shape of my spine. 
		That decreased the pain and allowed the muscles to regenerate. The 
		hospital also awarded me the Purple Heart based on my Retirement Orders 
		and the Great Lakes Hospital findings. <br><br>Between my attendance at 
		the 1943 RI Convention and the end of WWII, the Rotarian Editor,
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/library/rotarian/editors.htm">
		Leland Case</a>, asked me, along with several other Honored, young 
		Rotarians, to write two short articles on military/civilian conditions 
		and arrangements. Because of my battle wounds, my reports tinged of 
		pessimism more than the others.<br><br>Close to the 101st Air Assault 
		division<br><br>Three years after retiring as Chairman for Economics in 
		the City Colleges of Chicago, an elective position, Elaine and I 
		attended a Coral Sea Battle Association reunion in Florida. On the way 
		back we stopped at the Fort Campbell Guest House. Inquiring around, I 
		found that the local Austin Peay State University had a Fort Campbell 
		Center. The Director offered me a job. We moved down to Clarksville, 
		Tennessee. <br><br>A couple of years later, I learned a bit about 
		conversation and writing. I told my very good friend Dolph Honiker, the 
		News Editor of the Nashville Tennessean, &quot;We are going to another Ship 
		Reunion.&quot; He quizzed me, &quot;How many ships will be there?&quot; <br><br>Our 
		first week in Clarksville, I took my #7 to a theater tryout for The Man 
		Who Came to Dinner. She qualified as the daffy daughter. Although, I had 
		not been in a play since college, the director ordered me to play the 
		doctor. As the teaching job had not opened, I took the role. I had fun, 
		it was like teaching without papers to grade. Opportunities abounded, 
		Fort Campbell had two theaters and the town a couple more.<br><br>Still 
		without a job, I took the roll of Baptista in Kiss Me Kate. During the 
		run, an opening turned up. I turned it down. In our 22 year down there, 
		I taught only one semester and acted in 16 plays and musicals. In that 
		one semester on teaching, I found that the soldier and dependant 
		students bullied the teachers. Most of the young instructors needed the 
		$1,000 per class. I did not. By then, I had a number of community 
		projects. <br><br>In 1980, ROTARY again popped up. The Clarksville 
		Rotary Club decided to start a Sunrise Club. Knowing I had been in 
		Rotary and had known Paul Harris, the club brought me in as a Charter 
		member, my category Economist. Being an early riser, that really suited 
		me. For my last twelve years in Clarksville, I became very involved 
		again in the movement. <br><br>In those twelve years:<br><br>12 years on 
		committees<br><br>12 years perfect attendance<br><br>12 years as club 
		historian<br><br>Secretary 2001-2<br><br>President’s Significant 
		Achievement Award 1990-91<br><br>Presidential Citation 1996-97<br><br>
		Rotarian of the Year 1998-99<br><br>Paul Harris Fellow 1985 with 
		ROTARY/One <br><br>More on Honorary Memberships that I had spoken of 
		earlier. In 2002, the son of one of our members graduated from West 
		Point. Remembering my Rotary beginnings, I proposed Bill for an Honorary 
		Membership. Our senior member, a past District Governor, objected. He 
		claimed that in this case we did not have such a privilege. I prevailed 
		upon the Board to give the membership. The objecting member graciously 
		accepted defeat. I left before finding how that turned out. <br><br>
		Early Rotary was liberal with Honorary Memberships. The Chicago club in 
		1907 had 9 of them. The 1009 membership had had a list of 19 Honoraries. 
		In 1910, the club boosted the Honoraries to 21. The 1909 and 1910 
		Rosters included Manuel Munoz a New Jersey friend of Paul Harris. In his 
		first year, Manuel started the San Francisco club #2. <br><br>Each year, 
		we traveled to Chicago four times during those 12 years. I attended 
		ROTARY/One each trip. In 1985, I became a Ches Perry Fellow at Chicago 
		during Jack Hedrich´s Presidency. I attended ROTARY/One almost 50 times 
		during those years. <br><br>A Dozen Years At Old #1 <br><br>In 2002, we 
		moved back home. Old #1 was ready for me. Lollie McKeon, past Rotary 
		District Governor, and Jack Hedrich sponsored me. Not long afterward,
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/mckay.htm">Club 
		President &quot;Dick&quot; McKay</a> asked me to research and write a biography of 
		Ches Perry for the Centennial. Dick knew I had attended the club 
		meetings when Ches served as President. I do not believe he knew my 
		highest schooling was in Economic History. <br><br>The very private Ches 
		proved a daunting subject. Although, Ches and I shared a speaker’s table 
		6 December 1944 at the new member banquet, I do not remember a &quot;Pleased 
		to meet you.&quot; or even a hand shake. Paul reported &quot;Ches was faithful to 
		the last detail.&quot; That, gave him little time to explain. Russell Greiner 
		1913-14 RI President claimed &quot;I defy any psychiatrist or psychologist or 
		later-day scientist to penetrate his (Ches´s) brain machinery, tune into 
		his think waves and tell you what he was thinking, until he was ready to 
		reveal it.&quot; I got 43 pages. RGHF (Rotary Global History Fellowship) put 
		my study
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/rotaryone/historian/perry2005.htm">
		THE ROTARY LIFE OF CHESLEY REYNOLDS PERRY</a> on their web today 8 June 
		2010. <br><br>While searching for nuggets, I found that the 1905 
		membership roster contained only half the year’s membership, and the 
		1906 roster completely down the drain. Using &quot;Barney or Cupid&quot; Arntzen’s 
		1907 and later work as secretary, I resurrected those two defective 
		records. I deposited them in the Club and RI Archives. I can not 
		understand why Rotarians let a Century go by with those incomplete 
		records. <br><br>After bringing the records into shape, I began to 
		wonder how only 39 people, that first year, could grow so large in the 
		century since. With what information I could find in the various 
		records, I found a core of interested, active individuals. Eleven, I 
		call MOVERS, Twelve more went on the BENCH. Fifteen, including Gus Loehr 
		and Hiram Shorey, two of the first four, or six, acted only as 
		SPECTATORS. I call the work
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/rotaryone/historian/39pioneers.htm">
		THIRTY-NINE PIONEERS</a>. <br><br>One of the Rotarian Editors, Candy 
		Isaac, gave me Paul’s five Peregrinations, trips around the world for 
		Rotary the 1920s and 1930s. I gleaned 60 pages of quotes meant for 
		speakers. I call it
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/rotaryone/historian/harrismeant.htm">
		HARRIS*MEANT</a>, because Paul meant almost everything he spoke or 
		wrote. A shorter work
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/rotaryone/historian/tea.htm">
		A TEMPEST IN A COFFEE CUP</a> is there as well. It concerned a silver 
		coffee set given to Ches Perry in 1916, by the Southern Conclave. Future 
		Chicago President David Templin and Alice LeDoux President Rotary Club 
		of Santa Ana, CA got in touch with me the same week. They wanted 
		information about what they described as two sets. Digging around, we 
		found we had only one. It is on the 18th floor of Rotary International 
		Headquarters. Incidentally, Ches Perry was Alice’s uncle. These are on 
		the webs. <br><br>Perhaps, I can call this account MY CONTINUING WORK IN 
		ROTARY. But, at 93? I feel very gratified that Rotarians, include those 
		in the Rotary Global History Fellowship, successfully ask me questions 
		about those very early days of Rotary. I hope it continues. <br><br>
