		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/images/warren.jpg" style="float: left">As *Director of Education for Wolverhampton, a small city close to 
		Birmingham in the West Midlands, Tom had a natural affinity to Youth 
		Service and was a member of the National Youth Committee set up by the 
		Board of Education. He attempted to influence Rotary into working with 
		local authorities in finding and training leaders for the post war years 
		- significantly - as early as 1940. He also penned a Rotary 
		International booklet on Youth and dedicated his Presidency of RIBI (as 
		it was to become) to concentrating on the welfare and future of young 
		people.<br><br>*Tom Warren became an honorary member of Bournemouth, 
		Hants, England, for nearly 20 years, after he retired as an education 
		administrator.<br><br>
		Warren was a magnetic speaker and it was no coincidence that audiences 
		increased when he addressed conferences and conventions. Tom often felt 
		frustrated at the technical arguments in the movement. He told one 
		audience that &quot;I am sick to death of tinkering about with the machinery, 
		and I will make any sacrifice to get it out of the way and let us get on 
		with the job that Rotary exists for&quot;.<br><br>The darkest hours of the 
		Rotary movement - World War Two saw Tom Warren emerge as a great Rotary 
		Statesman. The strains that quickly emerged between Britain and the USA 
		reflected, inevitably, in the Rotary movement as conflict between 
		duty/service to the nation and the non-political desire for world peace 
		and understanding entangled the movement. Like two great structures, 
		tall and noble, both had and still do have a place in Rotary and who 
		dares to choose between the two? Both sides would have agreed with Tom 
		when he said in 1938, &quot;I say Auf Wiedersehen with affection and regret 
		to the German and Austrian friends I have lost - as Rotarians, that is. 
		I hope with all my heart we shall one day have them back&quot;.<br><br>At 
		Havana, 1940, RI secretary Perry had 'expunged from the record' 
		(according to Roger Levy in his book, &quot;Rotary International in Great 
		Britain and Ireland&quot; a part of the RIBI executive's greetings to the 
		Convention which mentioned &quot;British Clubs, alas, otherwise engaged in 
		international service&quot;. Warren was always too much of the gentleman to 
		rise in anger, preferring a genteel irony, and indeed paid a sincere 
		tribute to Ches Perry on his death in 1960.<br><br>Warren attended the 
		Convention, one of only two British and three European delegates. This 
		was a feat in itself as it took them six weeks of travel involving 
		waiting with some little patience for their transport. Tom and Reg 
		Coombes had to farcically propose and second the RIBI nominee delegate 
		to the International Board of Directors. Surprise, surprise, Tom was 
		elected unanimously. A statement of policy was passed at Havana named 
		Rotary and the World Conflict and said this,- &quot;Rotary is based on the 
		ideal of service and where freedom, justice, truth, sanctity of the 
		pledged word, and respect fro human rights do not exist, Rotary cannot 
		live nor its ideals prevail&quot;.<br><br>As second Vice-President of Rotary 
		International, his broadcast finale to the Rotary Convention in 1941 is 
		legendary. From an underground BBC studio relayed to Long Island and on 
		to Denver courtesy of the Mutual Broadcasting System and with 
		Churchillian eloquence, he told a hushed and clearly moved Convention 
		Hall, &quot;Tyrants thrive on the complacency of decent folk. Our Rotary must 
		no longer be complacent. We can be an ever-growing power in the world. 
		Our principles are right: by following them, regardless of cost, we 
		shall endure.&quot;<br><br>As RI President, he presided at Atlantic City, 
		1946 and in that year he called for a new beginning in the world, &quot;We 
		must give life to all those fellows who made the great sacrifice for us 
		and for their friends.&quot;<br><br>Tom Warren was asked to write a tribute 
		to Rotary founder Paul Harris in The Rotarian, March 1947 - one of four 
		former Presidents to contribute. His words had great and significant 
		meaning as he talked of Harris, &quot;His spirit lives on. It abides 
		everywhere. It is woven into the very fibre of other men's lives&quot;.<br>
		<br>Warren was a magnetic and inspirational speaker and who rightly took 
		his place at the head of the movement as peace dawned throughout the 
		world. He helped to hold the movement together in Britain as Rotary 
		Clubs throughout Europe saw their lights go out one by one. It is very 
		difficult to imagine the Rotary club meetings in those days - some club 
		meeting places were bombed out as were their successor venues. But the 
		meetings still went ahead despite the war with attendances better than 
		in the pre-war days.<br><br>Warren, the man, wished to emphasise the 
		individual's responsibility to Rotary.<br><br>&quot;There are some of whom we 
		wonder, as they speak, whether they can keep up the high standard of 
		their beginning. There are others - but not few - who leave us hoping 
		that, by some miraculous checking of the sun in its course, they will 
		not have to stop Tom Warren is one of them.&quot;<br><br>Calum Thomson<br>
