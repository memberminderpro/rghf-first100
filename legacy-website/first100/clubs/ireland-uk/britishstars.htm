				<td>BRITISH STAGE STARS IN ROTARY<br>
				<br>
				Although most people will be aware that the music hall star, Sir 
				Harry Lauder, <b><a href="../cities/clubs/60lauder.htm">(see 
				separate entry)</a></b> was a keen Rotarian, a member of the 
				Glasgow Club and a friend of Paul Harris, there were several 
				other artistes who became Rotarians. Naturally there were some 
				who were Honorary members but in addition there were those who 
				were full members. Many of them are no longer remembered, but in 
				their time, they were household names.<br>

G. Knowles, RC London, who was born in 1858 
				and died in1919. Richard Knowles's name is little known today 
				but from late Victorian days through the First World War, this 
				Canadian born artist was a popular and clever entertainer. He 
				was one of the early members of the Rotary Club of London, where 
				like Harry Lauder, in Glasgow, his classification was 
				'comedian', a description which was enhanced by his stage 
				appearances in a red wig, a battered opera hat, white ducks and 
				a frock coat. As a patter comedian, Knowles toured the Halls in 
				various parts of the Empire being especially well received in 
				Australia. A story is told of him that when the theatre cat 
				walked across the stage in one performance, he remarked that 
				&quot;This is supposed to be a monologue not a catalogue.&quot;. He was 
				much in demand as a visiting speaker at the early British Rotary 
				clubs, and was a keen Rotarian, being the only British member to 
				attend the 1917 Convention in Atlanta. He died at the age of 60 
				in 1919.<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<a name="prince">member</a> of the London Club between the wars was Arthur 
				Prince. Prince was born in 1881 in London and died in 1948. In 
				1918, he was listed among the London Rotary Club members as 
				number 354, Lieutenant Arthur Prince, classification, Variety 
				Artist, Ventriloquist. As a ventriloquist, his dummy was an able 
				seaman called Jim, so it is surprising, perhaps, that he starred 
				in early radio shows as well as in television. One of his shows 
				was 'Comedy Cabaret' in 1938. He is noted for being

				as the dummy and drink a glass of water (or stronger) at the 
				same time. When he died, he was buried in Hampstead Cemetery 
				alongside his dummy 'Jim'.<br>

				<a name="Tate">Tate</a>, Senior, was another London Rotarian with the 
				classification of 'Comedian'. He was born in 1872 and died of 
				injuries received in an air raid in 1940. Despite his 
				classification, Tate also appeared in several films alongside 
				such distinguished actors as Henry Fonda and Vivien Leigh, but 
				it was neither as an actor nor a comedian that he hade his stage 
				debut.</p>
				<p>Like Bransby Williams, (see below), he began his stage 
				career as an impressionist of such well known stars as Eugene 
				Stratton, Dan Leno and George Robey. His most famous sketch was 
				one about 'Motoring' and this was revived after his death, by 
				his son.<br>

				All three of the above performed on board at the launching of 
				the liner, the 'Aquitania' in 1914, in Liverpool, while Tate and 
				Prince were among the artistes, invited to take part in the very 
				first Royal Command Performance in 1912 . Harry Lauder was also 
				among those who performed in front of a very distinguished cast 
				at the Palace Theatre in London, before King George the Fifth 
				and Queen Mary, and many other members of royalty from both 
				Britain and abroad.<br>

				1871 and died in 1961. Although he started out as an 
				impressionist, impersonating Dan Leno, and even swopped places 
				with Leno on one occasion, it was as a monologuist that he made 
				his name. He was particularly noted for his impersonations of 
				characters in the novels of Charles Dickens. Williams performed 
				this act for over 50 years, heading the bill at the old 
				Parthenon Music Hall as early as 1897, and even appearing on 
				television into the 1950s. By 1918, he had become member number 
				298 of the London Rotary Club.<br>
				<br>
				In an address to the club in September 1925, on the eve of a 
				visit to the United States, Williams commented that he had 
				travelled 52,000 miles through the British Empire and had spoken 
				to practically every Rotary Club in Canada, Australia, Africa 
				and New Zealand. He was proud of his association with Rotary and 
				always found Rotarians the same. With his reputation as both an 
				artiste and a speaker, he was invited to preach a sermon in a 
				Canadian church, as well as addressing both houses of the New 
				Zealand parliament. As a friend of King Edward the Seventh, he 
				had often been asked to impersonate some of the King's friends 
				and associates, including Lloyd George and Earl Beatty, at 
				special functions. At the end of his address, he expressed the 
				sincere hope that Rotary Clubs would go on and prosper, and not 
				become merely luncheon clubs. He prayed that the flag of Rotary 
				would be carried on until their eyes grew dim and their hands 
				were numbed, but they handed it on to those that were young who 
				would carry the flag with the same dignity.<br>

				<a name="Bright">Bright</a>, though not strictly a stage star, can 
				perhaps be included here under the better known name of Geraldo, 
				the well known band leader. Born in London in 1904, Geraldo 
				started his career as a pianist playing for silent films. His 
				first band was 'The Gaucho Tango Orchestra' playing at the Savoy 
				Hotel in London and also on 2LO, and later still on various 
				other BBC stations. In 1945, by now at the top of his 
				profession, he joined the London Rotary Club. However, Geraldo 
				was one of the first to see the opportunities of the new cruise 
				ships and not only played, but also produced many of the 
				shipboard entertainments of the time. Geraldo died in 1974 and 
				curiously, his widow Manja later married a Rotarian, Morris 
				Leigh, who had been inducted on the same day as Geraldo. She too 
				became a Rotarian in London in 1997 and remained so until her 
				death in 2003.<br>

				Wiggins, archivist of the London Rotary Club, to whom we are 
				grateful for his help.</p>

					name of Sir Emile Littler, C.B.E. is perhaps not well known 
					outside the British Isles. Born in Ramsgate, Kent, in 1903, 
					into a theatrical family, Emile became an assistant stage 
					manager in 1925 at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, 
					becoming manager in 1931. Over the years he became a leading 
					producer of a wide variety of shows, though it is perhaps 
					for his pantomimes that he is best remembered. His influence 
					spread throughout the British theatre scene, and abroad. 
					During the 1930s, he visited America to work with the 
					Shubert brothers in New York and elsewhere. After the war, 
					he brought into the West End of London such shows as 'Annie 
					Get Your Gun'.</font></div>
				<div style="FONT-SIZE: 17px; MARGIN: 0px">
					<font size="3">For his theatrical work and for his many 
					contributions to charity, Emile Littler was knighted in 
					1974. He died in 1985. He was a member of the Birmingham
