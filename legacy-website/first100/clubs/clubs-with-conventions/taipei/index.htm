        </font>
        <font face="Arial"><small>was born on October 9, 1948. On that day, the 
        Club with 28 members, received its charter from Rotary International. 
        ROC Past President C. K. YEN, who in all these past 44 years has 
        remained a member of our Club, was elected Charter President.</small></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was just three 
        years and a few months after the end of World War II, and the formation 
        of the Club was of very special significance, since Rotary is an 
        international organization where freedom, justice, truth an world 
        fellowship are inherent in its goals. It was also at that time that the 
        seat of government of the Republic of China was moved to Taiwan owing to 
        the Communist menace in the mainland.</small></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in its first 
        year, our Club had the potential of becoming a truly international 
        organization. Of the 28 Charter members, 22 were Chinese and 6 were 
        foreigners, mostly Americans.&nbsp; Today in our 53th&nbsp; Rotary year, Our Club 
        has over 90 members with 24 different nationalities.</small></font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> THE FIRST TEN 
        YEARS</b> The Rotary years 1948-49 through 1958-59 were years of 
        &quot;firsts.&quot; Dr. Ton So-Kim, our Club's candidate, was awarded the first 
        (in Taiwan) Rotary Foundation Fellowship in RY1949-50. In December 1950 
        our Club held its first Charity Ball at Kwang Fu Hall in Taipei. TYPHOON 
        made its first appearance in July 1951, with ET as its first editor. The 
        intercollegiate English oratorical contest was started in RY 1956-57.</small></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A delegation of 
        Taipei Rotarians and Rotary Anns attended the Inter-City Forum of Rotary 
        clubs of Taiwan. Hong Kong and Macau in Hong Kong in March 1952, and in 
        April 1953 we sent its first two delegates to attend the Rotary 
        International Convention in Seattle.</small></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten other Rotary 
        clubs were formed in Taiwan during our Club's first ten year. With our 
        Club as sponsor, the Rotary Clubs of Keelung and Tainan were chartered 
        in November 1953, and the Rotary Club of Kaohsiung in the same Rotary 
        Year. These were followed by the Rotary Clubs of Hsinchu, Pingtung, 
        Chiayi, Taipei West, Ilan and Taichung, all chartered in RY 1954-55, and 
        the Rotary Club of Taipei North chartered in March 1959. </small></font>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orphanages and 
        underprivileged children were among the first beneficiaries of our 
        Club's charity contributions. In October 1951, our Club helped install a 
        tap water system for the Peitou Orphanage and an enclosing wall for the 
        Ai Ai Liau Orphanage. A free evening school for underprivileged children

        Garden, equipped by our Club, was opened in June 1956. Our Club also

        YEARS - RY 1959-60</b> saw the birth of District 345; in June 1960, the 
        Rotary Clubs of Taiwan and Hong Kong and Macau were given District 
        status. In April of the same year, the Chinese Rotarian Quarterly 
        magazine made its first appearance.&nbsp; In May 1961, the first District 
        Conference was held in Taipei; and the Chinese Rotarian Quarterly was

        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The years that 
        followed, particularly the following ten years from RE 1968-69, are 
        years of fast growth and expansion, not only of our Club but of the 
        Rotary movement all over the country and in District 345. Our growth is 
        measured not so much by the increase in the number of our members, but 
        by the international composition of our Club's membership and by the 
        multiplication of our activities and the increase in amounts of funds 
        that we were able to donate to charity, and by the expansion of our 
        services to both our Club and members and the community at large, and by 
        our increased participation in District and International Conventions.

        continuously increased our contributions to the Rotary Foundation, and 
        the number of Paul Harris Fellows among our members and some of their 
        Rotary Anns. We have not stopped aiding the orphanages and 
        underprivileged children who were among the first beneficiaries of our 
        charity work. On the contrary, we have expanded these activities to also

        the handicapped and orphans as well. Aside from the traditional 
        Christmas or New Year Party that w hold for underprivileged and crippled

        the community. In RY 1980-81, we supported the Taipei Life Line, in RY 
        1981-82, the Children's Cardiac Foundation. With funds of almost NT$2 
        million from the 1982 Charity Ball, we supported two major projects in 
        RY 1982-83; the Rota-car Project to be administered by the Salvation 
        Army, and the Chen Kuang Activity Center (join project with the Rotary 
        Club of Taipei Ta-an). The funds collected in the 1983 charity drive 
        were used to help the home for unwed mothers and the home for retarded 
        children. </small></font></p>

        Thailand in RY 1980-81. In RY 1981-82, in line with the year's theme, 
        World Understanding and Peace Through Rotary, we prepared slides 
        depicting Rotary in the Republic of China and the activities of our
