		The Birmingham Club was organised by the Irish American Stuart Morrow 
		and, after his visit to the city in 1928,Paul Harris is reported as 
		saying that “Birmingham was one of the clubs he had sent Stuart Morrow 
		to organise and he felt that they were indeed his children.” There is, 
		however, some question as to whether Harris or anyone in the USA 
		actually knew about Morrow’s efforts until the clubs applied to be 
		chartered.<br><br>On Monday, June 4, 1928, Paul Harris went to 
		Birmingham where he made his first speech to a British Rotary Club 
		before an audience including RIBI President-elect Chadwick. W Unite 
		Jones, the editor of the ‘Rotaria’, the Birmingham Club’s magazine, 
		commented in typically British fashion, “we had an extraordinarily 
		interesting meeting on June 4th when the Founder of Rotary, Paul Harris, 
		paid us a visit. There was a good gathering of members and President 
		William Adams was in the Chair.” In his welcome the Club President said 
		that it was a great privilege to have the father and founder of Rotary 
		with them in the flesh. He went on “The Rotary Movement has grown to a 
		tremendous degree in the few years it has been in existence. In visiting 
		various clubs, (people) would agree that they have built better than 
		they know. The spirit and goodwill and fellowship fostered by Rotary has 
		made Rotary universal.” When Paul Harris rose to address them, the 
		assembled members stood and applauded him for some time. The President 
		Emeritus might have been out of sight for many years but clearly his 
		inspiration had not been forgotten. In his opening comments, Harris said 
		that he was happy in the fact that the Chairman had centred his remarks 
		round the movement he represented rather than around himself personally. 
		He was to try, not always successfully to judge by newspaper reports, to 
		make this distinction on many occasions.<br><br>The subject of his 20 
		minute address at Birmingham was ‘The Genesis of Rotary’. As he wrote 
		later......”when the time came, I did my turn and at its conclusion, 
		resolved that I had better tune up or quit.” Despite his own misgivings, 
		his audience disagreed and his address was well received. He began his 
		talk with some reminiscences of his earlier voyages to Britain when he 
		had worked his passage and endured hardships which would appall the 
		present generation. He still had, as The Rotary Wheel reported, “an 
		irresistible urge to visit the country he had always looked upon as the 
		‘Land of his Fathers’. Every member felt the better for sitting awhile 
		at the feet of the new Apostle Paul.” Here in Birmingham he enunciated a 
		theme which he was to repeat elsewhere on this tour, in saying, 
		“Friendship is not an anaemic thing. It is capable of hurling itself 
		over those barriers which men have been building between each other 
		through centuries of time. I am not going to attempt to affect religious 
		or national feeling, but I feel that there ought to be some place where 
		men can meet on an honest plane, without respect to those other 
		considerations, and I want Rotary to be that sanctuary.”<br><br>Despite 
		Paul Harris’s opening comments, S.J.Grey in proposing the vote of 
		thanks, said that they were glad Paul Harris had talked upon personal 
		lines because now they had seen the man and heard him, they could 
		understand a little of that breadth of view and sympathy which had made 
		his conception of Rotary possible. He thought that Paul Harris must be a 
		proud man when he realised that the Rotary ideal was permeating the 
		national life of the various countries and business life and that it 
		could be fruitful of nothing but good. Before the end of the meeting, 
		Arthur Chadwick was invited to to address the audience and he too 
		commented on the respect and regard they all had for their founder. 
		Later that day, Harris journeyed to Liverpool to take the night boat to 
		Ireland.<br><br>In 1934, several Birmingham members went to a big 
		gathering in Manchester where they would again meet Paul Harris, and in 
		1937, Birmingham members once more met Paul Harris this time at a 
		meeting in High Wycombe.</td>
