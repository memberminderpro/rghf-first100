		holding our banner.<br><br>-A Short History Of The Founding Year Of The 
		Rotary Club Of Cleveland <br>by Leon H. Swartout, Executive Director Emeritus <br><br>
		When the late Leon H. Swartout became Executive Director Emeritus of The 
		Rotary Club of Cleveland at the end of 1996, he immediately embarked 
		upon a mission to write the history of the Club. What follows is a 
		condensation of his account of the Club's founding year. <br><br>The 
		Founding<br><br>Some time before 1910, Major Charles R. Miller, a 
		prominent Cleveland attorney and a veteran of the Spanish-American War, 
		found himself in the company of Rotary's founder, Paul Harris. They met 
		on a train going from Chicago to San Francisco. Paul Harris told Major 
		Miller about this new and unique club, which was now called &quot;Rotary 
		Club,&quot; that he and three other young men had organized in the city of 
		Chicago. Paul explained to Major Miller about the distinctive 
		classification system and that each member was expected to favor other 
		members in the club with his business. Major Miller was well respected 
		in Cleveland and was a cousin of President William McKinley. <br><br>In August of 1910, Major 
		Miller went to Denver, Colorado to an encampment of Spanish-American War 
		veterans, and there he met up with an old comrade, Army Captain Chesley 
		R. Perry. In 1908, Mr. Perrry had joined the newly formed Rotary Club of 
		Chicago and was &quot;on fire&quot; for Rotary. He had been involved earlier that 
		year as Chairman of the Extension Committee of the Chicago Rotary Club, 
		calling together the 16 Rotary Clubs that existed at the time to a 
		meeting in Chicago. The purpose was to discuss the formation of a 
		National Association. As a result of this meeting, the first Rotary 
		convention was held at the Congress Hotel in Chicago. The National 
		Association of Rotary Clubs was formed and Chesley Perry was elected the 
		Secretary. All of this early Rotary Global History was related to Major 
		Miller at the Denver encampment. <br><br>During the very next month, 
		September of 1910, Ches Perry was attending a meeting of the Perry's 
		Victory Commission in Cleveland, and he and Major Miller again talked 
		about Rotary. Ches went into all the details regarding the organization.
		<br><br>As a result, Major Miller began to build interest locally and 
		finally asked Ches Perry to again come to Cleveland, which he promised 
		to do. In October of 1910, Major Miller, assisted by Thomas Goss, 
		gathered about a dozen or so men and they met for lunch in a small room 
		in the old Chamber of Commerce building. These men set about becoming an 
		organizing committee to form a Rotary Club. Major Miller was the acting 
		President and Arthur E. Merkel, a patent lawyer, became the acting 
		Secretary. <br><br>The names of the first twelve to fifteen men who were 
		involved is a bit fuzzy in the records of the Club and in the memories 
		of those who later commented about the meeting. Also, it seems that, to 
		these early Rotarians, there was a mixing up of who was Ches Perry and 
		who was Paul Harris. It is most likely that Ches Perry attended the 
		October 1910 meeting while Paul Harris and Ches Perry both were in 
		attendance at the subsequent December 1 organizational meeting. <br><br>
		Certainly present at the October meeting, in addition to Major Miller 
		and Arthur Merkel, were: William Downie, master painter of the William 
		Downie Painting Company; Herman R, Neff, an architectural engineer; 
		Herman Moss of the Equitable Insurance Society; and William Storch, 
		water heater sales. <br><br>At this meeting, a temporary organizational 
		committee was set up. A Nominating Committee was formed as well as a 
		Constitution and By-laws Committee. Each man present was to bring a list 
		of ten names to the next meeting. By October 29, 1910, they had some 50 
		members pledged. The goal was to get 100 names and then schedule a 
		dinner and get a permanent organization started. They were advised to go 
		slow with a view to making the best selections possible for new members.
		<br><br>Eventually, on Thursday, December 1, 1910, a formal 
		organizational meeting was held at the Chamber of Commerce, with 35 men 
		present. Paul Harris and Chesley R. Perry were both in attendance. They 
		answered questions and made presentations to the new Rotarians. Officers 
		were elected for the fiscal year beginning on January 1, 1911. Charles 
		R. Miller was elected as the first President of the Rotary Club of 
		Cleveland. <br><br>It was voted to hold meetings on every second Monday, 
		and an entertainment committee was instructed to decide on the next 
		place of meeting. At this organizational meeting it was moved that a 
		member absenting himself without a written excuse for three consecutive 
		meetings be dropped from membership. This idea exists in various forms 
		in Rotary yet today. The cost of the dinner at the organizational 
		meeting was $1.00. <br><br>Annual dues were set at $15 and it was 
		carefully pointed out to the membership that this included twelve meals 
		as well. Thus the luncheon plan subsequently set up in 1985 by the 
		Rotary Club of Cleveland was nothing new; it had been in existence in 
		1910-1911. <br><br>After the meeting on December 1, Paul Harris and Ches 
		Perry, along with others, adjourned to the Hollenden House (I'm guessing 
		it was actually the bar) for further talk and relaxation, beginning yet 
		another tradition that continues to this day. So, there you have a 
		little bit of Rotary Global History.</td>
