		Although Paul Harris passed through Manchester on his way from Liverpool 
		to Leeds in 1928, he does not appear to have attended any meetings 
		there. He did, however, meet some of the club members, among them Peter 
		Thomason, the President of the British Association of Rotary Clubs in 
		1916, when they attended functions in Liverpool and later in Clumber 
		Park.<br><br>It was not until 1934 that Paul Harris made an official 
		visit to the club and even this was nearly cancelled. In company with 
		Jean, Paul had begun the year with an extended tour of Britain, before 
		going on to South Africa. On the voyage back on the Union Castle liner 
		'Winchester Castle', Paul Harris caught a severe cold and decided to 
		cancel his planned visits to English Rotary clubs and instead continue 
		direct to Scotland to &quot;visit informally some of the clubs which by 
		reason of their remote location had seldom been visited by the officers 
		of RIBI and never by officers of RI&quot;, let alone Rotary's founder 
		himself. While in Inverness, he received a telegram from RIBI asking him 
		to reconsider the cancellation of his visits to English clubs. It 
		pointed out that it was too late to cancel the proposed inter-city 
		meetings in Cheltenham, Shrewsbury and Manchester. As the Highland air 
		seemed to have done him some good and he now felt much reinvigorated, 
		the President Emeritus wired London to say that he would return in time 
		to keep these engagements.<br><br>On June 7, 1934, Paul Harris was met 
		at Crewe by President Percy Reay and Lewis Sladen of the Manchester Club 
		who drove him on to his next engagement. When the little group reached 
		the Midland Hotel, one of the first to greet them was Fred Foxall who 
		had been a founder member of the club in 1911. Paul Harris' visit to the 
		Manchester Club lunch at the Alexandra Room in the hotel was the 
		occasion of the biggest meeting that club had ever seen, attended as it 
		was by 111 Manchester members, 132 other Rotarians from 41 of the nearby 
		clubs and 118 ladies and non-Rotarians. Members came from all round the 
		District as well as from Birmingham, Kendal, Swindon, Torquay and 
		Workington. Representatives of each of the visiting clubs were invited 
		to rise in turn and give their greetings to their President Emeritus, if 
		possible &quot;in two words&quot;. One visitor delighted the assembly by wishing 
		the Founder &quot;the best of good things from Britain's premier seaside 
		resort&quot;, another from Wrexham wished him &quot;good health&quot; in Welsh, while a 
		Clitheroe member capped the lot with &quot;By gum, he's a champion.&quot;<br><br>
		Then, after a toll of the bell, there was a hushed silence and the tall 
		erect figure of Percy Reay rose and invited &quot;our President Emeritus Paul 
		Harris to address us.&quot; Harris began his speech, after a prolonged 
		ovation, by saying that Manchester, as one of the Founder Clubs in the 
		British Isles (Charter number 4), meant a great deal to Rotary. For the 
		main body of his talk, he dealt with the 'Sixth Object of Rotary' saying 
		that Rotarians should try to break down the habit of one nationality 
		speaking disparagingly of another, a reflection perhaps of his 
		experience on Deeside. He instanced the disparaging views about some 
		Eastern races who ate raw fish while forgetting that Westerners ate raw 
		oysters. Harris went on to describe some of his experiences from his 
		recent trip to South Africa. He ended by urging all Rotarians to be 
		'Ambassadors of Goodwill'. At the close of the meeting, Paul Harris 
		stood by the door and shook hands with everyone as they left, a much 
		appreciated gesture.<br><br>Later in the day he went to meet Mrs 
		Golding, the President of Inner Wheel, and discussed with her, not only 
		his wife Jean's interest in the work of Rotary's womenfolk but also his 
		hope that Inner Wheel would soon be &quot;internationalised&quot;. After this, 
		Harris went out to the country home of Percy Reay at Prestbury where 
		they chatted over a cup of tea mainly about the people Harris had met on 
		his journeying round the world. Some years later, Reay recalled Harris 
		as being &quot;a happy little man with a Yankee voice, a Texan hat and a 
		stride reminiscent of a kangaroo.&quot; However, he was less complimentary 
		about Harris' actual performance as a speaker and observed that &quot;Paul 
		Harris was a very poor speaker and certainly didn't look a great leader, 
		but that he was a most interesting character&quot;. Reay made this comment in 
		the 1980s long after the event. Nevertheless, Percy Reay described it as 
		&quot;the highlight of my year as President&quot; and the two and their respective 
		wives certainly got on well together at a personal level. Indeed, 
		although Reay offered to take Paul Harris on a drive through Cheshire, 
		&quot;he much preferred people to places&quot; and instead they went to take tea 
		at Reay's house. Later that day, Paul Harris returned to the Midland 
		Hotel in Manchester for a dinner with Past Presidents and other officers 
		of the Manchester Club.<br><br>For his last day in England on this tour, 
		June 8, he was escorted by Seymour Bell. They went first to the offices 
		of the Manchester Guardian where they were warmly welcomed by the 
		legendary editor John Scott. From there it was a short step to the new 
		Central Public Library. Paul Harris pointed out that the Library of the 
		City of Chicago maintained a collection of all important Rotary 
		publications and hoped to be able to put the two city libraries in touch 
		with each other. Finally, accompanied now by a dozen Manchester 
		Rotarians, Paul went to the Central Station and caught the 12.30 train 
		to Liverpool. They then went down to the Pierhead to board the White 
		Star liner 'Laurentic' for Canada, took tea in one of the ship's lounges 
		and said their goodbyes. Before leaving the ship Tom Headon was asked to 
		convey to the Manchester Club, his very best wishes and deep 
		appreciation of his reception.<br><br>Paul Harris was next in Manchester 
		in 1937. The Manchester Club's regular meeting was on a Thursday but on 
		hearing that Harris would be passing through their city en route for the 
		Isle of Man, a special evening meeting had been arranged for Friday July 
		9 at the Victoria Hotel. Despite the short notice, 110 Rotarians from 19 
		clubs gathered to meet and greet their distinguished guest. His talk on 
		that evening was described in the club bulletin as &quot;of the informal 
		homely kind- the sort of thing that goes with slippers, an armchair and 
		the usual accessories, and it made him a host of friends. He reduced the 
		torrent of words about Rotary's philosophy of life to the simple 
		elemental things, friendliness and usefulness, and gave characteristic 
		illustrations of the way these qualities are found time and time again 
		to be instructive in really great men. One thought he gave us,&quot; wrote 
		the bulletin editor, &quot;upon which we might well ponder was that Rotary 
		was not a sacrificial life. To some that may mean a real adjustment of 
		outlook and it is a dictum which can well provoke thought and 
		discussion&quot;. Again, as in his 1934 visit to Manchester, Paul Harris made 
		a point of shaking hands with all present as they filed past on their 
		way out. As the bulletin report concluded, &quot;There was one at least who 
		felt that, in spirit at all events, his real name was Peter Pan.&quot;</td>
