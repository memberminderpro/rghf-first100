		<img class="auto-style26" height="192" src="1922boysday500bw.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>It was pouring rain when 
		twenty-five men from Oakland, Alameda, and Berkeley, California, 
		gathered in the stately Metropole Hotel in Oakland on November 27, 1908. 
		A lawyer from San Francisco named Homer Wood engrossed them with his 
		description of the new club he just helped form in the city across the 
		Bay. It was based on the original in Chicago, a club of business and 
		professional men engaging in reciprocity, friendship, and, in the past 
		year, civic service.<br><br>With enthusiasm, the East Bay men took their 
		first steps that day to form the Tri-City Rotary Club, which would soon 
		evolve into the even stronger Oakland Rotary Club, the third oldest 
		Rotary club in the world!<br><br>The colorful book, The Rotary Club of 
		Oakland, a Century of Service and Friendship reveals the groundbreaking 
		sweep of history as Rotary took hold in Oakland. Chock full of photos, 
		timelines, and anecdotes, profiles of Rotary's founders and its 
		legendary leaders, the decades come to life set in the crucible of 100 
		years of world history.<br><br>How did Rotary’s concepts take hold in 
		the face of wars, famines, natural disasters, and vast human need? How 
		have the service projects and philosophies forged by the third oldest 
		Rotary Club in the world affected Rotary International, its own city, 
		and communities around the globe?<br><br>In The Rotary Club of Oakland: A Century of Service and 
		Friendship, readers will journey through time to witness how the Club 
		evolved and thrived over a hundred years. Like me, they may find new 
		heroes amongst the amazing leaders and humanitarians that are Rotarians, 
		and inspiration and hope in the face of so much Service Above Self.<br>
		<br>I hope you will join us for the book’s release at the California 
		Ballroom at 1736 Franklin Street, Oakland, at noon on May 31, 2012. In 
		the meantime, watch our website, 
		<a href="http://www.oakland-rotary.org/" target="_blank">www.oakland-rotary.org</a>, for information 
		about how to purchase a copy.<br><br>In the coming year, I look forward 
		to sharing with fellow RGHF members the joys and pitfalls of creating a 
		club history book, as well as excerpts and more photos from Oakland’s!<br>
		<br>People are often surprised when I tell 
		them that our Rotary Club of Oakland is the third oldest in the world. 
		They say, “Oakland? Really?!”<br><br>It’s true that our city faces many 
		challenges that have resulted in some unfortunate bad press over the 
		last four decades. But the folks who live here know that Oakland is a 
		progressive, vibrant, beautiful city, with a history of cutting-edge 
		innovation, passionate creativity, and social and political trend 
		setting.<br><br><a href="1909feb-gala-300dpi.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style26" height="178" src="1909feb-gala-300dpi.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>For example, Oakland once had the largest ice rink in 
		the United States. It also had the best equipped typing school, the 
		longest airport runway, the busiest port and rail depot, and the 
		greatest production of ships and automobiles west of the Mississippi. 
		Oakland has produced many great artists and leaders. In music, our city 
		helped give birth to west coast blues, funk, soul, and hip hop. It was 
		at the forefront of civil rights in the 1960’s and of technology in the 
		2000’s.<br><br>Oakland, along with its surrounding bay area, still glows 
		with the spirit of pioneering boldness and the optimism of the golden 
		west. Given this context, it makes sense that San Francisco became the 
		second Rotary Club in the world, followed by Oakland only weeks later.<br>
		<br>It also makes sense that the Oakland Club developed many firsts in 
		Rotary. We were the first to hold weekly lunch meetings and the first to 
		host an inter-city meeting. Oakland members formalized the custom of 
		calling members by their first names and co-founded Rotary’s World 
		Community Service project fairs.<br><br>Just as important, Oakland 
		Rotarians for 100 years have recognized good ideas generated by other 
		Rotary clubs and brought them back to Oakland. Ours is a Club of 
		“doers,” so these ideas resulted in dozens and dozens of successful 
		service projects and Club traditions. Over the century, as the needs and 
		face of society changed, the Rotary Club of Oakland, No. 3 changed its 
		focus to meet those needs.<br><br>Oakland Rotarians are truly passionate 
		about making the world and their community a better place, by measuring 
		decisions against the Four-Way Test and actively practicing “Service 
		Above Self” in their lives. And, they make valuable friends and have fun 
		doing it!<br><br>In The Rotary Club of Oakland: A Century of Service and 
		Friendship, readers will journey through time to witness how the Club 
		evolved and thrived over a hundred years. Like me, they may find new 
		heroes amongst the amazing leaders and humanitarians that are Rotarians.<br>
		<br>The opportunity to create this book has made me deeply proud to be a 
		member of the Rotary Club of Oakland, the third oldest in the world.<br>
		<br>I hope that within its pages readers find pleasure and inspiration 
		and that this book will serve as a valuable resource about this Club, as 
		well as Rotary International, for many years to come.</td>
