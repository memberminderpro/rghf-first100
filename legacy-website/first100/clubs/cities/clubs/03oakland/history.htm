		meeting in Rotary history, inviting their brethren from San Francisco 
		over for lunch. From this would eventually come the tradition of make-up 
		meetings at other Rotary clubs.<br><br>In February 1909, Tri-City 
		celebrated its formation with an elaborate gala at the Hotel Athens.<br>
		<br>Frank Bilger served less than six months as president of Tri-City. 
		Taking over was Dr. Ernest Robert Tait, a London born dentist, who 
		embraced Tri-City Rotary’s main theme at that time: “You scratch my back 
		and I'll scratch yours.”<br><br>Despite this focus, Tri-City did achieve 
		its first Community Service in 1909. The club pressed the Southern 
		Pacific Railroad to pave Seventh Street, the town's chief commuter 
		thoroughfare. The effort cost no money, but it did cost the club a few 
		of its pioneer members who took offense, and there were charges of 
		&quot;meddling&quot; from City Hall.<br><br>Harvey Lyon, Oakland Rotary President 
		and Paul HarrisControversy and ill-will began to penetrate Tri-City in 
		1909 and 1910. There were forced business practices such as 'boost 
		week,' when members drew numbers from a hat and would concentrate in 
		trading as much as possible with that member who drew the lucky number. 
		There was a threat of boycotts by outside businessmen who seemed unable 
		to secure trade from Rotarians. There was political controversy and 
		personality disputes.<br><br>Perhaps this strife is best illustrated by 
		the tale of the Tri-City Mad Hatter.<br><br>Paul T. Carroll held the 
		classification as 'hatter' in 1909. One meeting, he stormed in late, 
		red-faced, and exploded. “Just before I came in this room I made it my 
		business to check the hats parked in the cloakroom just to see how many 
		Paul T. Carroll labels were tucked inside. I found only six out of 125 
		hats with my name. Do you call that loyalty?&quot;<br><br>Well, Paul the Mad 
		Hatter was promptly replaced with another Oakland hat merchant. But more 
		importantly, the incident brought to a head the festering problems 
		within the club.<br><br><a href="dinner.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="226" src="dinner.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>In August 1910, when the first National Rotary 
		convention was held in Chicago for the then 16 clubs, Tri-City failed to 
		send representation—either by delegate or by proxy. And attendance at 
		the weekly meeting had reached a low point.<br><br>What would become of 
		the Tri-City Club in the decade to follow? How would Tri-City become 
		Oakland Rotary? Would the Mad Hatter return?<br><br>Yes, in 1910 the 
		Tri-City Rotary Club was in trouble!<br><br>President Tait plodded on 
		focusing on the business advantage Rotarians possessed over outsiders.<br>
		<br>&quot;Every week,” said one Rotarian, “we would wonder whose curtain 
		rods, life insurance or buggy robes we would be pressured into buying 
		next!&quot;<br><br>Also tearing the club apart was the issue of annexation.<br>
		<br>During December of 1909 Oakland annexed nearly 40 square miles. 
		Alameda members of Tri-City complained that they were now too far 
		removed from Berkeley to derive any commercial benefits from that 
		direction, and Berkeley Rotarians said the same thing about Alameda.<br>
		<br>Tri-City's ranks began to shrink. By May 1910, Only 27 members 
		answered the roll call. <br><br>1911<br>

		Scotsman, a baker and candy maker by trade, who helped Oakland Rotary to 
		sweetly rise once more.<br><br>Robbie Robertson became the club’s third 
		president, the only one to serve two full terms. A partner at Cape Ann 
		Bakery on 12th Street, he was described as peppy and lively, always with 
		a twinkle in his eye and an endless repertoire of Scottish stories, 
		songs and jigs. (He would go on to entertain the American troops in 
		Europe with the YMCA during WWI.)<br><br>Paul Harris and Robbie 
		Robertson, 1911Up until then, Tri-City had NOT participated in the 
		National Association of Rotary Clubs…then Robbie Robertson went as an 
		observer to the 1911 convention in Portland, Oregon. He brought back two 
		slogans that came into being at that convention: &quot;He Profits Most Who 
		Serves Best” and “Service Above Self.”<br><br>But back home, the 
		Tri-City club was insolvent. On August 10th Robbie called his directors 
		into an emergency meeting. The eight men agreed to abandon the 
		struggling Tri-City Rotary Club, pay debts, and start anew under the 
		banner of the Rotary Club of Oakland.<br><br>

		wrote Robbie to Paul Harris, &quot;to clean out the undesirable and 
		disrupting members and reorganize the faithful Rotarians.&quot;<br><br>Under 
		its new name and philosophy, the club flourished. Generosity reigned. 
		Robbie brought samples of Scotch shortbread and oatmeal cookies to 
		meetings and H. Vose of Standard Warehouses arranged bouquets of San 
		Leandro cherries on the tables. <br><br>Oakland Rotarians began to 
		extend their generosity to the community, providing leg braces, 
		artificial limbs, x-rays and surgery for the crippled, tonsil 
		operations, rent money and cash for destitute families, support for 
		orphans, insulin for diabetics . . . and on one occasion a bicycle for a 
		boy so that he could help earn a living and support his mother.<br><br>
		The California Girls Training Home expressed gratitude to the club for a 
		washing machine. The Relief Home sent thanks for their new linoleum 
		flooring. <br><br>Meanwhile, the Annexation dispute continued, reaching 
		a climax when a San Francisco association attempted to amend the State 
		Constitution to annex parts of Oakland and other East Bay communities. 
		San Francisco newspapers discouraged local businessmen from hiring 
		anyone outside the city.<br><br>Rotarians, however, did not buy in.<br>
		<br>On February 20, 1913, Oakland Rotarians staged what newspapers 
		called a &quot;Love Feast,&quot; a festive dinner in the Hotel Oakland attracting 
		500 Rotarians from both sides of the bay. <br><br>1912 teamRotarians 
		also took fellowship to the baseball diamond in 1913, when the San 
		Francisco club challenged Oakland to a series. They played at the 
		championship Oakland Oaks’ brand new park in Emeryville.<br><br>Under 
		Manager Al Saroni, Oakland Rotarians won all five games. Go Oakland!<br><br>CALL ME BY MY FIRST NAME.<br><br>Tom Bridges1914-OR-First 
		Edition of Live Oak, the Club's Weekly Bulletin, 29Oct 1914The club’s 
		fourth President Tom Bridges, right, came to Rotary as the director of 
		Heald School of Business and was a charter member of the Oakland Chamber 
		of Commerce. He enjoyed lifelong hobbies of penmanship and rock 
		collecting. A rock in Rotary, Tom maintained a 100 per cent attendance 
		for 33 years. <br><br>Under Tom’s administration, the February 1914 
		issue of The Rotarian was dedicated to the Oakland Club. That same year, 
		our club created the Live Oak, our 94-year old weekly publication.<br>
		<br>Perhaps Tom’s most influential contribution to Rotary was at the 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/conventions/1914/index.htm">1914 national Rotary convention in Houston, Texas</a> when he stood up to 
		make a stirring appeal that henceforth Rotarians should call one another 
		by their first names. Though the Chicago club had been using first 
		names, it was not the custom of the time, and it was the motion by Tom 
		Bridges that made the use of first names in Rotary systematic worldwide. 
		- It became Rotary custom from that day forward. (also see Tenets of 
		Rotary

		Oakland Rotary embraced Paul Harris’ vision of Rotary expansion. We 
		became mother (along with San Francisco Rotary) to the Sacramento club 
		in 1913, Stockton and San Jose (1914), Fresno (1915), and Berkeley in 
		1916. Oakland Rotary would go on to sponsor clubs in over 115 cities and 
		not only in the U.S. (graphic: The Spread of Rotary from Oakland - The 
		&quot;Great Oak&quot;) President V. O. LawrenceIn 1915, club President V. O. 
		Lawrence visited Honolulu and helped organize Rotary in the Hawaiian 
		Islands. He did the same in Milan, Italy and in Germany.<br><br>
		FINES AND BELLING RINGING<br><br>V.O., our sixth president, grew up on 
		the Island of Fohr in the North Sea, arriving in San Francisco at age 16 
		to work on the docks. He went on to become a shipping magnate, 
		establishing the Lawrence Warehouse Company in Oakland. Volkert also 
		devoted himself to building the Boy Scout movement in Oakland. <br><br>
		He was the first Rotarian in history to inaugurate a system of fines on 
		latecomers at the weekly luncheons, enriching the club's charity funds. 
		From this practice evolved the birthday fine and bell ringer, 
		International Rotary traditions. (also see Tenets of Rotary)<br><br>1914-Cover The Rotarian, Oakland Issue, City HallCode of 
		EthicsIn April 1914, Oakland hosted the first Interstate Conference in 
		Rotary history. The California clubs discussed the big event of 1915:<br><br>
		<a href="birthdaytable.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="172" src="birthdaytable.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>With the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in town, San Francisco 
		won the honor to host the sixth annual Rotary International Convention. 
		Except on July 22nd. On that day 600 Rotarians from around the world 
		traveled by ferry steamer to Oakland.<br><br>Four Way Test billboardFrom 
		this convention came the 1915 Code of Ethics, the foundation of 
		Vocational Service in Rotary, later encapsulated in the Four-Way Test.<br>
		<br>The Rotary Club of Oakland continued its good works throughout the 
		decade. It planted 1,200 trees along Oakland's Foothill Boulevard, the 
		Lincoln Highway in 1916. <br><br>In 1919 when Corpus Christi, Texas was 
		hit by a hurricane, Oakland Rotarians had a check for $10,000 in the 
		mail within half an hour after a telegram arrived asking for help.<br>
		<br><a href="birthday.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="321" src="birthday.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>When World War I shook Europe in 1914, the Rotary Club of Oakland 
		sent relief to Belgium. In 1917, the club collected 7,000 pairs of shoes 
		for the civilians of war-torn France. <br><br>Rotary club of Oakland 
		group portrait 1917In the meantime, thirteen Oakland Rotarians left to 
		serve in World War I. <br><br>How many of those would return to bring in 
		the roaring 20s? And how loud was the roar of The Rotary Club of Oakland 
		in the Jazz Age?<br><br>Miraculously, all thirteen arrived home safely 
		and with Armistice Day on November 11, there was dancing in the streets 
		of Oakland. <br><br>And then came the roaring 20’s, and boy, did Oakland 
		and Oakland Rotary roar!<br><br>With the establishment of the Port of 
		Oakland, new improved roadways and rail lines, manufacturers moved into 
		Oakland in droves. General Motors, (then Durant Motor Company), 
		Chevrolet, and Caterpillar Tractor all set up plants within city limits, 
		making Oakland the “Detroit of the West.” Broadway Avenue’s “Auto Row” 
		was three times as long as it is today. Charles Lindbergh helped to open 
		the internationally acclaimed Oakland airport with the longest runway in 
		the world in 1927, 13,000 homes were built from 1921 to 1924, more than 
		all the houses built since 1907. The locally-famous Grand Lake and 
		Fox-Oakland Theatres opened their doors. Rotarian families enjoyed 
		outings to Idora Trolley Park on the north banks of Temescal Creek. New 
		luxury apartment buildings and office buildings appeared. And the 
		California ballroom in the Leamington Hotel, the club’s current meeting 
		place, first hosted dances in 1925.<br><br>At the same time, Rotary was 
		expanding around the globe like wildfire. And to keep the momentum 
		going, the International Association of Rotary Clubs staged an ongoing 
		monthly attendance contest. <br><br>Achieving one hundred percent 
		attendance was a measure of loyalty for individual Rotarians in the 
		1920s. It’s a record still kept by some of Oakland’s illustrious members 
		today. But could an entire club achieve 100 percent attendance?<br><br>

		Horwinski challenged the Oakland membership with this goal and had a 
		plan for achieving it.<br><br>Horwinsky Group PlanA little about 
		President Max, proprietor of Horwinski Printing Company<br>Max's idea of 
		a perfect day was to go to a baseball game, return home to a duck 
		dinner, then wind up the evening with a game of poker. Within the club, 
		he was known best for his laughter and wit. To the rest of the Rotary 
		world, he was known for his Horwinski Group Plan.<br><br>He divided the 
		club into groups of men whose business interests were generally related. 
		There were the building industry manufacturers and the food producers; 
		those in the auto industry and the graphic arts and publicity folk. 
		There was even a group who all had businesses on 13th Street in Oakland, 
		like the club’s Grand Avenue Rotary Row Revelers today.<br><br>Each 
		group competed against the other for top attendance every Thursday at 
		the Hotel Oakland. And they got into it. They were vying for the tables.
		<br><br>A 1921 Live Oak declared, “A person who holds membership in 
		Rotary and does not attend the weekly luncheons parallels the fellow who 
		does not fish but throws stones in the water where others are fishing.”<br>
		<br>When Max noticed some members were repeatedly absent, he segregated 
		them into a group called &quot;The Outcasts.&quot; <br><br>That idea worked too. 
		&quot;The Outcasts&quot; topped the attendance competition for the next 42 
		meetings. <br><br>And then, on November 14, 1922, the Rotary Club of 
		Oakland did it: all 232 members attended a meeting. Tom Eaglesome was 
		club president at the time.<br><br>“Well, fellows, you did it!” said Tom 
		to the membership, “this marks an epoch in the history of our club.”<br>
		<br>
		<img src="Rotary&#32;club&#32;of&#32;Oakland&#32;group&#32;portrait&#32;1917.jpg"><br>By the end of 1929, Oakland Rotary celebrated eleven consecutive 
		years of top-10 attendance. The club received letters of recognition 
		from around the world for this unbeatable record, and Rotary clubs 
		everywhere adopted the Max Horwinski Group Plan for their own, but not 
		just for attendance purposes. Part of the plan was that each group chose 
		a service focus and held regular meetings to further their annual goal. 
		These were our original service committees.<br><br>Named for the 
		chairperson, they included:<br>The Harold Oliver Group supporting the 
		Camp Fire Girls, the Lew Thunen Group, who started the Student Loan 
		Fund, Oakland Rotary’s fist scholarship program, and The Camp Dean 
		Group acting as advisors and counselors for students of Oakland High 
		School, like the club’s HOPE mentors of today.<br><br>In 1921, Clem Ady’s 
		Business Methods Group started what they called The Mar-No-Name 
		campaign, “a crusade to halt the spread of unfounded rumors and gossip 
		that frequently destroyed both business and personal reputations.” 
		Member Al Saroni wrote and directed a playlet entitled &quot;Mar No Name,&quot; 
		that was so successful, Rotary clubs worldwide reproduced it. The 
		business community of Oakland wore “Mar-No-Name” buttons on their 
		lapels.<br><br>But the largest single Rotary project of the 1920s by far 
		was Boys Work. It was deemed so important that Rotary International 
		actually added it to the Rotary bylaws at the 1920 convention in 
		Atlantic City. The aim was to help boys build character and thus create 
		better citizens.<br><br>As a part of these efforts, Oakland Rotarians 
		sponsored &quot;camperships&quot; for thousands of underprivileged Oakland boys. 
		In 1921 they took 1,600 orphans to the Oakland Orpheum to see 
		Vaudevillian Will Cressy.<br><br><a href="redcross.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="226" src="redcross.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>They built the first cabin at Camp 
		Dimond-O, the Oakland Boy Scout Camp in November 1923.<br><br>Joseph J. 
		Rosborough (Oakland’s Postmaster) was chairman of the Rotary Boys Work 
		Committee in 1921 when they raised $25,000 to help the Boy Scouts, the 
		Y.M.C.A., a Big Brothers movement, and give a boost to public health and 
		vocational guidance in Oakland Public Schools. <br><br>Joe also 
		coordinated efforts for Boys’ Week, which took place the first week of 
		May in 1922. <br><br>Each day had a theme, but the most exciting day of 
		the week was Thursday, Rotary Day.<br><br>[Monday was Industry Day, 
		exposing boys to how products are manufactured. Tuesday was Back to 
		School and Good Turn Day, when Rotarians spoke in classrooms about the 
		urgency of completing one’s education and the value of “doing a good 
		turn daily”. Wednesday focused on health and fitness].<br><br>Boy's 
		WeekOn that day, 8,000 Oakland boys paraded up Broadway from the City 
		Hall Plaza to Lakeside Park where Rotarians served hot dogs to each and 
		all.<br><br>
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/cities/clubs/03oakland/CodeOfEthics-1915.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="491" src="CodeOfEthics-1915.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>The San Francisco Examiner reported:<br><br>“Three gardeners 
		threatened suicide; ducks and rabbits scurried for safety, and the event 
		passed into the history of Oakland’s younger generation as one of the 
		biggest days of their young lives.”<br><br>Rotary International had 
		another concern that year. In 1922, the novel Babbit by Sinclair Lewis 
		hit the shelves. Its main character is an unthinking, unhappy, and 
		corrupt businessman whose weekly highlight is the backslapping, singing 
		camaraderie of like-minded men at his “luncheon” club.<br><br>That was 
		it! Rotary International directors declared it was time to change the 
		image of Rotary from a luncheon club to a service club once and for all.<br>
		<br>Oakland Rotary was ahead of the curve. By 1921, the club’s Publicity 
		and Rotary Information group was already printing almost daily articles 
		in Oakland and San Francisco newspapers. In 1926 they erected Rotary 
		wheels made of wood and brass at the Oakland city limits.<br><br>And 
		there were other good works. Members formed the Thanksgiving Cheer 
		Committee in 1922 donating boxes of food to needy families. In 1925, the 
		club donated one pole among the 126 of Lake Merritt's new &quot;Necklace of 
		Lights,&quot; and Oakland Rotarian Romaine Myers designed it. In 1982 after 
		years of intermittent black-outs, it was another Oakland Rotarian, Brad 
		Gill of Gill Electronics Co., who redesigned it. <br><br>Oakland Rotary 
		sent disaster relief to Santa Barbara after the 1925 earthquake and to 
		Mississippi River flood sufferers in 1927. The service work and the 
		business success of Oakland Rotarians in the 1920s were big and 
		widespread.<br><br>But then in October 1929 came the crash on Wall 
		Street. Black Thursday ushered in the Great Depression. <br><br>How 
		would Oakland Rotarians fare in this low economic tide? Would they get 
		depressed?<br><br><a href="1920-OR-Max&#32;Horwinski.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="360" src="1920-OR-Max&#32;Horwinski.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>1930<br>Not at first. <br><br>Bowling TeamIn 1930, the 
		club’s bowling team won its seventh championship in the international 
		Rotary competition. There were dinner dances, fishing expeditions, golf 
		tournaments, and, of course, the annual Smoker, chewing tobacco provided 
		for those who don’t smoke.<br><br>By 1932, however, the affects of the 
		Depression were clear. The February dinner dance emphasized Low Cost. 
		Speakers frequently discussed the current economics.<br>But in the 
		background, with government support, some of the area’s greatest 
		landmarks were being built.<br><br>And despite the members’ troubles, 
		student scholarships increased, as did donations to the Community Chest, 
		later known as the United Way of America.<br><br>By the end of the decade, 
		America’s economy was booming again, but war once more was scorching 
		Europe as well as Asia. Oakland Rotarians looked to see what they could 
		do.<br><br>By 1940, 532 Rotary clubs in Europe and Asia had disbanded as 
		World War II raged.<br><br>In 1941, Oakland Rotarians sent $15,000 to the 
		Rotary clubs of Great Britain for war relief, and received a thank you 
		letter from Madame Chiang Kai-shek for the $500 they gave to China.<br>
		<br>In 1942, thirteen members of the club left to serve in the war.<br><br>
		<a href="032OR-Harold&#32;Oliver&#32;Group,&#32;Horwinski&#32;Group&#32;Plan,&#32;Golden&#32;West&#32;Rice&#32;Milling&#32;Company,&#32;June&#32;21,&#32;1926.jpg" target="_blank">

		number of men who would later become respected Oakland Rotarians also 
		fought in the war.<br><br>For those at home, the care of our youth was 
		of greatest importance, with more camperships, children’s aid, and 
		vocational guidance at Oakland high schools.<br><br>With the end of war, the 
		club focused on relief for veterans and donated over 20,000 pounds of 
		flour to the Friendship Train headed for Europe.<br><br>Oakland Rotary 
		sponsored a branch of the new East Bay Children’s Hospital. There was 
		also an increase in funding study abroad and hosting international 
		students as part of Oakland Rotary’s Institute of Peace and 
		International Understanding for Oakland students.<br><br>
		<a href="scouts.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="221" src="scouts.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>One war was over, 
		but by 1949 a new kind of war was forming…The Cold War, leaving Oakland 
		Rotarians feeling the chill.<br><br>1950s<br>350 Oakland Rotarians were 
		on the books in 1951, with one or two new members almost every week.<br>
		<br>For 100 years, Oakland Rotary has provided provocative guest 
		speakers on a number of topics to a membership eager to learn.<br><br>An 
		example in 1950 was a Mr. Richard Nixon, who spoke to the club about 
		developing a democratic policy on Communism. His passionate speech 
		caused President Ed Pitcher to remark, “I wish there were more in 
		Washington like him!”<br><br>Community service was abundant in the 50s. 
		Rotary was proud of their contributions to the new Children’s Fairyland, 
		the inspiration for Disneyland, and the construction of the Rotary 
		Natural Science Center. There were generous donations to the YMCA and 
		the Young American Baseball league.<br><br>International service 
		increased too, as air travel and airwaves brought us closer. <br><br>

		Rotarians sent magazines to Australia, books to the Philippines, clothes 
		to Hungarian refugees, and donations to a leper colony in Bangkok.<br>
		<br>But, by 1959, while the club celebrated its golden anniversary, the 
		war in Vietnam had begun. Duck and cover drills were common practice in 
		schools.<br><br>What could Oakland Rotarians do to promote peace during 
		these tense times?<br><br>1960s<br>Oakland was right in the midst of the 
		social revolution and civil rights of the 60s. <br><br>Meanwhile, Rotary 
		International elected its first non-Caucasian president, Nitish Laharry 
		of Calcutta, India.<br><br>In memory of Prime Minister Nehru, Oakland 
		Rotarians joined neighboring clubs helped to establish a library at 
		Indore, India, with more than 30,000 books. At home, we donated a huge 
		Geo-Physical Globe of the Earth to the unique Oakland Museum.<br><br>

		<img class="auto-style27" height="207" src="1928OR-Bowling&#32;champions&#32;of&#32;OR-1928.JPG" style="float: left" width="250"></a>With the passing of fifty-year member, Al Saroni in 1961, the club 
		inaugurated the fabulous Al Saroni Scholarship fund (later renamed to 
		include member Nat Lena). <br><br>Today, Oakland Rotary has given 1.5 million 
		dollars in Saroni-Lena Scholarships to help Oakland teens get to 
		college.<br><br>In 1966, Oakland made Rotary history once more by 
		hosting the largest ever inter-city meeting with 1,500 Rotarians in 
		attendance.<br><br>By 1969, it seemed like anything was possible. What 
		was possible for Oakland Rotary?<br><br>1970s<br>In the 1970s, while 
		Oakland Rotarians waited in gas lines with everyone else, they served

		<a href="navy.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="200" src="navy.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>The Club encouraged cultural 
		awareness by sponsoring the Oakland International Festival in 1978. They 
		established the Oakland Rotary Endowment to ensure even greater service 
		into the next century. To date, members have collected over 1.2 million 
		dollars for this charitable fund.<br><br>In 1975, The Rotary Club of 
		Oakland found a sister in Fukuoka, Japan and have enjoyed great 
		friendship ever since. Arigotou gozai-masu.<br><br>Celebrating America’s 
		bicentennial in 1976, the club donated and dedicated the 125-foot 
		flagpole in Jack London Square, at the time California’s tallest 
		flagpole.<br><br><a href="workers.jpg" target="_blank">

		<img class="auto-style27" height="168" src="sciencecenter.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>That same year, we hosted our First Annual Wine 
		and Food festival at the Oakland Museum, a successful fundraiser for 27 
		years.<br><br>Also in 1982, the club held its first Camp Enterprise, a 
		weekend retreat during which Oakland high school juniors learn about 
		free enterprise and leadership under the tutelage of Rotary volunteers.

		the 1980s, member Karl Stucki encouraged Oakland Rotarians to take their 
		service around the globe like never before. Among others, Oakland funded 
		the San Salvador Hospital Project and supported the village of Paquila, 
		Guatemala with healthcare and education, profoundly improving their 
		quality of life.<br><br><br>Personally, 1987 was a pretty good year. That’s 
		when the Supreme Court decided it was time for women to join Rotary, a 
		decision Oakland Rotary was already in full support of. Exactly 30 days 
		after the court decision, the club enthusiastically welcomed six women 
		as new members. Since then we’ve enjoyed the leadership of four 
		wonderful women presidents.<br><br>It was an earthshaking decade that 
		ended with the Loma Prieta earthquake in Oakland. What would be the next 
		shake-up in the 90’s?<br><br>1990s<br>Oakland Rotarians went all around 
		the world in the 90’s, bringing water to villages in China and Costa 
		Rica, medical aid and equipment to Venezuela and Ghana, and

		the Dotcom bubble burst around us, Oakland Rotary continued to launch

		<br>After 13 years of efforts, the Barrier Free Park opened in 2007, 
		providing a playground where children of all ages, with any kind of 
		disability, can be kids and play.<br><br>Members traveled to Guatemala 
		to witness cleft palate surgery, to Afghanistan with sewing machines for 
		the widows of Kabul, and to China to deliver wheelchairs.<br><br>In May 
		2008 , the Oakland Reads project provided 3 books to every public school 
		third grader in Oakland, a total of 10,000 books! In 2009, that total 
		exceeded 12,000 books, extending the donation to the children of 
		neighboring city, Emeryville.<br><br>

		Rotary Club of Oakland has committed $100,000 to fund educational 
		curriculum for the dramatic bronze sculpture Remember Them: Champions of 
		Humanity by artist and Oakland Rotarian, Mario Chiodo, the largest 
		bronze sculpture west of the Mississippi.<br><br>The Rotary Club of 
		Oakland is made up of humanitarians, leaders in our community who have

		grow and work toward peace and understanding worldwide one smile, one 
		handshake, one book, one dollar, one drop of medicine at a time.<br><br>
		As part the club’s formal celebration of 100 years of service and 
		friendship, the club enjoyed another milestone Gala, this time at the
