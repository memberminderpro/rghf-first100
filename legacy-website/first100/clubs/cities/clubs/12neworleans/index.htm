		Many in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, will remember Mardi Gras 2006 as a 
		symbol of resilience over natural catastrophe and governmental failure. 
		Mardi Gras showed that New Orleans will stand on her feet again, and 
		Hurricane Katrina could not stop the city from celebrating its world 
		famous carnival.<br>Like Mardi Gras, the Rotary Club of New Orleans, 
		USA, has reason to celebrate its rebirth. &quot;We were knocked down but not 
		knocked out,&quot; said club president Charles Young.<br>
		<br>The storm<br><br>Hurricane Katrina hit in August 2005, and suddenly 
		the club, which had met for 25 years in the Fairmont Hotel on Canal 
		Street, was in limbo. The club's phone number was disconnected, and its 
		members scattered across the country.<br><br>Young and his family, as 
		did countless others, took what they could fit in their cars and headed 
		out of town as the hurricane approached. Together with his wife, his 
		daughter's family and their many pets, including a parakeet, Young 
		evacuated to Lafayette, a town approximately 130 miles from New Orleans. 
		After the levees broke, he realized that he would not be coming home 
		anytime soon. Young remembered that he kept in his glove compartment of 
		his car a tattered RI directory. He used it to contact the Rotary Club 
		of Lafayette, Louisiana.<br><br>Wearing the only pair of long pants he 
		had packed, Young attended the Lafayette club's weekly meeting in the 
		first week of September. After listening to his account of escape from 
		tragedy, Lafayette Rotarians asked Young how they could help. &quot;I told 
		them, 'One of my daughters is staying in a New Orleans hotel room with 
		her husband, her son, one dog, two cats, and three gerbils,'&quot; Young 
		said. Minutes later, Young held the keys to a local member's pool house 
		in his hand, without a deadline to leave.<br><br>Soon after, Barbara 
		Collins, executive secretary of the New Orleans club, via cell phone 
		tracked him down in his Lafayette rental home. She reported anxiously 
		awaited news about fellow Rotarians. Young then started to look for ways 
		to contact his fellow club members. Finally, after gaining access to a 
		computer, Young used the club's Web site directory to e-mail and call 
		the other club members. &quot;I will never evacuate without a laptop, a 
		broadband card, and access to e-mail again,&quot; the 63-year-old says 
		without a hint of irony.<br><br>The Youngs' flight from hurricanes, 
		however, was not over. Hurricane Rita forced the family to flee one more 
		time, this time to Baton Rouge, Louisiana.<br><br>They finally returned 
		to New Orleans at the end of September to find that their house, which 
		was in the Lakeview neighborhood of New Orleans, had been sitting in 
		flood waters for three weeks. They knew they had lost their home of 31 
		years. It was a fate they shared with thousands of other New Orleanians.<br>
		<br>Not in it alone<br><br>Members of the New Orleans club found 
		strength through each other. A core group, organized by former club 
		president Richard McCarthy III, met at a downtown restaurant on 2 
		November for the first time since Katrina struck. &quot;It was a great 
		experience to see familiar faces,&quot; Young said. &quot;Rotary provided a 
		wonderful safe haven.&quot;<br><br>The New Orleans Rotarians had been through 
		a lot. Henry Lowentritt, a club member, lost his audiovisual equipment 
		business and had to let his 12 employees go. Lowentritt remembers that 
		very little business was discussed at that Rotary club meeting. &quot;It was 
		a time of happy reunion and fellowship but also news of others who had 
		not fared so well. [There was] so much uncertainty, but every event 
		indicating a return to normalcy was a measure of New Orleans' survival 
		and recovery.&quot;<br><br>Young was determined to keep the club alive, even 
		though he knew there would be huge challenges. &quot;We had to start from 
		scratch,&quot; he said.<br><br>Club members waived dues for October, 
		November, and December and set the first Wednesday in December as a 
		target date for the first official post-Katrina club meeting.<br><br>
		After only a three-month hiatus, caused by what a club newsletter calls 
		a &quot;not-so-nice lady named Katrina,&quot; the Rotary Club of New Orleans 
		resumed its scheduled weekly meetings on 7 December 2005, at 12:12 p.m. 
		— the club's traditional start time as a nod to its history. In 1910, 
		the club was the 12th club to be chartered.<br><br>The club is carrying 
		on, but, for now, with fewer members. Some of the nearly 200 pre-Katrina 
		members may never return to the city. But nearly 50 loyal Rotarian 
		regulars gathered at their new headquarters at the Loews Hotel in 
		downtown New Orleans that Wednesday in December.<br><br>Rotarians give 
		back<br><br>Rotarians worldwide cheered on the club's rebirth. Financial 
		aid arrived from Rotarians as far as England and France. One Canadian 
		Rotary club, said Lowentritt, collected nearly 12,000 books, which its 
		members hand-delivered to New Orleans' Rotarians for distribution in 
		schools.<br><br>Money is still flowing in from clubs across the country, 
		and Rotarians in New Orleans are busy distributing it to those in need. 
		But the fight to keep the club going and financially sound when its 
		members are struggling to rebuild their businesses, homes, and family 
		lives continues. Yet, despite the hard times, Rotarians are helping 
		their community get back on its feet.<br><br>They're cleaning up and 
		restoring Warren Easton High School on 3019 Canal Street, in the 
		Mid-City district, which housed and Interact club before Katrina shut it 
		down. School officials have assured Rotarians they'll re-open Warren 
		Easton High in the fall if the club completes its restoration.<br><br>
		&quot;We had to go through a lot of housekeeping at first,&quot; Young said, &quot;but 
		we try to stay true to our colors. We're doing things only Rotary can 
		do.&quot;<br><br>Individually, Rotarians are also reaching out to less 
		fortunate New Orleanians. Club president-elect Susan Simon invited two 
		displaced hurricane victims to live with her. Both in their 40s, the two 
		women don't have family in the city and are still waiting to have their 
		homes rewired for electricity.<br><br>&quot;It's been fun,&quot; Simon says of her 
		extended household. &quot;It's like having your girlfriends around all the 
		time.&quot;<br><br>Another club member, Lowentritt, helped local jazz 
		musicians receive financial aid from French and U.S. Rotarians.<br><br>
		As far as club membership is concerned, Young is also optimistic. He 
		says membership is now at 65 percent of pre-Katrina days, and it's 
		growing. &quot;We've recruited three new members in the past two weeks,&quot; 
		Young said. &quot;We're gaining momentum.&quot;<br><br>Collins added that weekly 
		meetings are sold out until April, thanks in part to the impressive 
		array of high-powered speakers who already appeared or scheduled to 
		speak.<br><br>If Mardi Gras 2006 serves as a time to evaluate efforts to 
		rebuild the Gulf Coast, the New Orleans Rotarians can proudly say they 
		are part of it.<br><br>Into the future<br><br>As Charlie Young waved to 
		the crowds from atop a float during one of the last Mardi Gras parades, 
		he thought: &quot;We have finally turned a corner.&quot;<br><br>For Young, 
		Lowentritt, and Simon, Mardi Gras represents a deeply rooted family and 
		hometown tradition, and they're pleased New Orleans was able to 
		celebrate it.<br><br>But the celebrations aren't meant to fool the world 
		that everything is back to normal, said Lowentritt. Life may not ever be 
		what it was before Katrina came to town. At 63 years old, Lowentritt, 
		whose business was ruined, is now looking for a new career. Young is 
		building a new home, despite recently suffering a heart attack.<br><br>
		Meantime, the topic of discussion for the meeting the morning after Fat 
		Tuesday was levee reform. The Rotary Club of New Orleans is back in 
		business, with more business than ever on its hands.<br><br>From the 
		website of Rotary International&nbsp;</td>
