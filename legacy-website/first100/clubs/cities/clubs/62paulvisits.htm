						  		On Friday July 13, 1928, the Harrises went to 
								Edinburgh, Jean's native city. There Paul had a 
								rapturous welcome from the local club which had 
								announced two months earlier that, on this 
								occasion, their regular Thursday lunch would be 
								held instead on the Friday at 1 pm. The Club 
								President, R Stuart Pilcher, welcomed their 
								visitor who, because there was already another 
								speaker booked for the meeting, kept his words 
								short.<br><br>In what a correspondent to 'The 
								Rotary Wheel' described as &quot;a brief and breezy 
								speech&quot;, Paul Harris talked about the progress 
								made by Rotary in several European countries. 
								Although the lunch meeting was for men only, 
								Jean was able to join Paul at an evening meeting 
								held later the same day. Afterwards, the members 
								arranged a convoy of vehicles to provide the 
								Harrises with a late night tour of the city, 
								during which they drove as far as the Forth 
								Bridge reaching it well after midnight! On the 
								way back to the city, despite the lateness of 
								the hour - it was now 1.30 am - Jean suggested 
								that they detour to see the little statue of 
								Greyfriars Bobby, the story of which impressed 
								Paul. While in Edinburgh, Paul Harris sat for a 
								bust being sculpted by a Rotarian and his wife 
								from the South West of England. This was George 
								Mitchell who had driven 400 miles from Somerset 
								on the chance of getting a sitting with Harris, 
								which was readily granted despite the busy 
								schedule.<br><br>In March 1934, the Harrises 
								returned to Scotland to stay for a time in 
								Ayrshire with Jean's brother who was now a 
								minister at nearby Annbank. While there, they 
								were greeted by members of the Rotary Clubs of 
								Edinburgh and Dunfermline who had come to ask 
								Paul if he would attend their weekly meetings. 
								So, on April 4, they travelled to Edinburgh 
								where Lord Provost Thomson had invited Rotary's 
								President Emeritus to attend and speak as the 
								guest of honour at the banquet of the Assembly 
								of the Lords Provost of Scotland. Highland 
								pipers played the plaintive 'Road to the Isles' 
								as the Harrises ascended the steps to the City 
								Chambers. For the 52-year-old Jean, who had left 
								her city 25 years earlier, it was a most 
								memorable homecoming. Unsure what to say to the 
								Assembly, Paul decided that the most appropriate 
								topic would be 'Chicago'.</td>
						  <td class="auto-style24" valign="top" width="50%">
								While being entertained by the Lord Provost, &quot;a 
								movie for the archives of Rotary International 
								was staged&quot;. Attempts have been made to find 
								this film, a copy of which was sent to RI in the 
								USA, and it was hoped to show it at the Glasgow 
								Convention in 1997 but the search proved 
								unsuccessful.<br><br>Next day, April 5, 
								following a brief half hour at the District 
								Council meeting, both Paul and Jean received a 
								rousing welcome from more than 200 Rotarians, 
								their wives and guests at the weekly lunch 
								meeting of the Edinburgh Club held at the North 
								British Hotel. Rotarians from all over Scotland 
								as far afield as Inverness had come to meet the 
								Harrises. Other clubs represented included 
								Glasgow, Dundee, Perth, Stirling, Dunfermline, 
								Paisley, Falkirk, Arbroath, Motherwell, Hamilton 
								and Cupar, and even members from across the 
								border from Berwick on Tweed. The Edinburgh Club 
								President made a presentation to the couple of 
								an inscribed silver salver, which became one of 
								their most treasured possessions. In his brief 
								reply, Paul Harris devoted much of his speech to 
								his wife, saying that he was well aware that 
								they really wanted to see her and not him. 
								Speaking of Scottish people, he went on to say 
								that he had a feeling that the Scots, with all 
								their assumed reserve, were just as sentimental 
								a people as any other. They had been practising 
								the Rotary spirit for generations.<br><br>In the 
								evening, they went to dinner with some friends 
								and on the next day, April 6, Paul kept his 
								promise to visit the Dunfermline Club.<br><br>On 
								Thursday July 29, 1937, Paul Harris attended 
								what was to be his last Rotary club meeting in 
								Britain at the regular luncheon of the Edinburgh 
								Club. The speaker that day was RIBI Director W B 
								Hislop who reported on the recent Convention in 
								Nice which Paul had attended. That afternoon, 
								Paul, joined by Jean, went on a large Rotary 
								outing to the ancient castle at nearby Newbattle 
								Abbey, his last official engagement before 
								returning to the United States.<br><br>
