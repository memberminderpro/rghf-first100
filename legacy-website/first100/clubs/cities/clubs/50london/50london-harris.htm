    OF PAUL HARRIS TO LONDON </font></b>
    <p>
    <a href="../50london.htm">Return to London #50</a></p>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="4" width="100%" id="AutoNumber1"

      <tr>
        <td width="50%" valign="top"><style="font-size: 9pt">
    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Paul Harris had visited London in his pre-Rotary days and he 
    returned there in 1928 for meetings with British Rotarians and some gentle 
    sightseeing with G. Edward Line, the London Club President. On at least two 
    occasions during this visit, he met delegations of London Rotarians with 
    whom he dined informally. At a meeting fully reported the next day in the 
    Daily Telegraph, he attended the London Club meeting at the Hotel Cecil on 
    Wednesday June 13. Afterwards Paul Harris wrote: &quot;It has never been my 
    privilege to address a more inspiring gathering&quot;. In replying to the toast 
    of &quot;Our Distinguished Guest&quot; by John Hill, Chairman of the Greater London 
    district, Harris told his audience that during the course of his visit to 
    this country there had been nothing that had caused him to have a bad 
    impression. He had never been overcharged or dealt with unfairly and he 
    could not imagine any place on earth more beautiful than the English 
    countryside. He referred to the value of literature in cementing 
    international relations, and said that America owed a great debt to the 
    influence of Charles Dickens. The little Nells and little Dorrits had a 
    better influence than all the big Berthas that had been manufactured since 
    the beginning of time. He went on to deal with the development of Rotary and 
    the work that it was doing for the care, cure and education of cripple 
    children. In 23 years' experience he had known men who had been reborn in 
    Rotary by the miracle of friendship. There was no difference of race or 
    religion that friendship was incapable of bridging. There were now over 
    130,000 Rotarians in 44 countries of different races and religions.</span></p>
    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: 9pt">His audience of nearly 600 contained many Rotarians from 
    other clubs including Wilfred Andrews of Ramsgate, President RIBI 1930/1. 
    Also present was Sydney Pascall of London who was to become President of RI 
    in 1931/2. There were even 29 Rotarians from other countries. A Streatham 
    Club correspondent later wrote in the 'Rotary Wheel' that ; &quot;One felt for 
    President Paul Harris to devote his holiday to acquainting himself with as 
    many fellow Rotarians as could crowd to daily receptions, was taxing his 
    staying powers unfairly.&quot; This was a sentiment which, while admirable, was 
    rarely raised by anyone else!</span></p>
    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: 9pt">In 1932 Paul Harris again visited London when he was 
    accompanied by Hugh Galloway, the President of RIBI. Wednesday August 10, 
    was the 21st birthday of the London Rotary Club and well over 300 Rotarians 
    sat down at the Great Central Hotel adjacent to Marylebone Station to 
    celebrate the event. Among those present, there were no less than 169 
    visitors from 76 other clubs. Apart from the President Emeritus, other 
    distinguished guests included Immediate Past President of RI Sydney Pascall 
    of London and Wilfrid Andrews, an RI Director, who had been Paul Harris' 
    chauffeur on a high speed drive from London to Canterbury four years 
    earlier. Pascall was actually on holiday at the time but travelled 
    especially to London to meet Paul Harris and join him at this birthday 
    party.</span></p>
        <p>
        <span style="font-size: 9pt">After an enthusiastic welcome, Paul Harris made a short 
    speech in which he reminded those present that Rotary had not brought 
    anything new into the world. But it had been most successful in its 
    organisation work, and it had found a way to put forward its great 
    principles in the everyday affairs of life. &quot;Most of you&quot; he continued, &quot;are 
    aware that in the City of London there was a Club organised and in operation 
        centuries ago on the so-called classification plan. There is nothing new 
    about Rotary except that Rotarians from the beginning, saw the possibility 
    of making the Movement interesting for mankind and subsequently placed it on 
    world wide foundations. When we first began talking in Chicago about organising a Rotary Club in this country, the attitude of mind was one of 
    scepticism. </span></font></font></td>
        <td width="50%" valign="top"><style="font-size: 9pt">
    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: 9pt">I cannot speak for the minds of my fellow workers but I can say 
    for myself that the most ambitious project that I had in my life at that 
    time was to see a Rotary Club organised and established in the City of 
    London.&quot;</span></p>
    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: 9pt">He went on to describe how Harvey Wheeler and Arthur 
    Sheldon, the latter a friend of his, had come to England and established 
    clubs, firstly in London and then soon afterwards in Manchester. Meanwhile 
    another Rotarian, <b>
    <a  href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/leaders/morrow/index.htm">
    <font color="#0000FF">Stuart Morrow</font></a></b> of the San Francisco Club had started clubs 
    elsewhere in Britain, although at the time this was not known in America. 
    Soon, others in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Birmingham had been added 
    to the list. Harris told his audience that this was his second opportunity 
    to see Rotary in action on this side of the Atlantic, and he expressed his 
    gratitude to those present for having taken the Movement as it had been 
    developed in North America and raised it to greater heights. &quot;We feel&quot; he 
    said, &quot;that we can depend on British Rotary to carry on in many ways that 
    which would be impossible for us. I see no reason whatever why we cannot 
    ultimately become that which some of our members have already proclaimed us, 
    one of the greatest Movements that has ever been organised in the interests 
    of mankind.&quot;</span></p>
    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Following this, five Past Presidents spoke about the early 
    days of the London Club and the development of Rotary in the London area, 
    which by 1932 had over 2500 members. One Past President, J Bain Taylor, 
    thought that that this growth was due in part to the late Charles Dewey who 
    in his time in office had agreed to new clubs being formed in London. 
    &quot;Something, he said, &quot;which should be a lead to all the great cities of the 
    world.&quot;</span></p>
    <p align="left"><a name="blair_fish"><span style="font-size: 9pt">That</span></a><span style="font-size: 9pt"> evening Paul Harris was entertained by Percy Jones, the 
    London Club President, at the latter's home where they had &quot;a delightful 
    evening.&quot; On the Friday, he spent most of the day with <b>
    <a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/clubs/ireland-uk/magazine/index.htm#blair_fish">Blair-Fish</a></b> at the 
    RIBI's offices and while there, he went out to Tavistock Square to have his 
    photograph taken with some of the office staff. This photograph appeared in 
    various journals.</span></p>
    <p align="left"><span style="font-size: 9pt">In 1934 on April 11, he was back in London. He went first to 
    the London Club's lunch at the Hotel Russell. The meeting was devoted to a 
    report from a committee headed by Sydney Pascall which proposed a move by 
    the club to a more centralised location. It also recommended the 
    relinquishment of certain territorial rights. This latter proposal, repeated 
    over many subsequent years both in London and other major cities, such as 
    Chicago, engendered a lively debate. The motions for change were, however, 
    soundly defeated. Paul Harris expressed considerable interest in the 
    discussions but made no comment in his diary about the result of the London 
    Club vote! That night Harris dined with Ted Unwin, a Past President of the 
    London Club, his wife and some friends. A few years earlier, Unwin, together 
    with Arthur Chadwick, had been instrumental in promoting the idea of Rotary 
    beyond the immediate area of Central London into the surrounding suburbs. 
    Eventually some territory was ceded and their first new club was opened at 
    Streatham in 1923. By 1934, the number of clubs in the London area had grown 
    to over a hundred. It was therefore appropriate that on the next day, 
    Thursday April 12, after a visit to the RIBI's offices in Tavistock Square, 
    Paul Harris, accompanied by Ted Unwin, went to a lunch meeting of the 
    Streatham Club.</span></p>
