        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify">
    Paul Harris first visited Merseyside in 1893 when he was working as deckhand 
    and later cattleman on the SS 'Baltimore' of 3730 tons which carried cattle 
    from Philadelphia to Birkenhead and took 14 days on the crossing. By all 
    accounts, it was rough in almost every way, with primitive conditions, poor 
    food and stormy seas. Once in the Mersey, Harris left the ship and took the 
    opportunity to spend a few days in Liverpool staying at the Sailors' Home 
    before signing on for the return journey. This time the crossing from 
    Liverpool was on another of W Johnston's ships, the slightly smaller, at 
    3318 tons, but newer SS 'Parkmore'. Both vessels were British owned and 
    Liverpool registered and Harris seems to have found this return voyage more 
    agreeable. He had also enjoyed the chance to do some sightseeing in 
    Liverpool during the stopover.</p>
    <p align="justify">In 1928, Paul Harris on a tour of Britain passed through 
    Liverpool on the way to Belfast on Monday June 4, returning on the morning 
    of Thursday June 7. A Liverpool Echo reporter was able to interview him that 
    morning in time to put a piece in the evening edition. The article is 
    interesting in throwing a little further light on an earlier visit by 
    Harris. It read:- &quot;In conversation with an Echo reporter, Mr Harris who 
    practises as a lawyer in Chicago, recalled an earlier visit to the city 
    under very different circumstances. 'Liverpool was the first British city I 
    ever saw', he said, 'I was then 22 years old, had completed my college 
    course and had a great longing to see England. As I had no means, I worked 
    my passage on an old fashioned cattle steamer called the 'Baltimore' which 
    sailed from the USA to Liverpool. When the ship anchored in the Mersey, some 
    of us were taken off in lighters and landed in Liverpool while the rest went 
    with the cattle to Birkenhead. I spent several days seeing the sights of 
    Liverpool and District before signing on for the return voyage at the 
    Sailors' Home. I worked my passage back. I spent five years seeing as much 
    of the world as I could,' he added, 'before settling in the practice of law 
    in Chicago.'&quot;</p>
    <p align="justify">Paul Harris was scheduled to give a talk to a large 
    gathering of Rotarians, many of whom were curious to learn what sort of man 
    Rotary's founder really was. Indeed, the advance notice for this meeting had 
    specifically said, &quot;No Rotarian will lightly forego this unexpected 
    opportunity of meeting and hearing their illustrious pioneer.&quot; The meeting 
    was held in the Banqueting Hall of the Exchange Station Hotel in Tithebarn 
    Street, Liverpool, with the Club President Bill Gibbons in the Chair. Unlike 
    other such meetings, there seems to have been only a handful of visitors 
    from other clubs, three from Wallasey, two from Warrington and one each from 
    Stockport, St Helens, Buxton and Manchester. Arthur Chadwick, the President 
    elect of RIBI, however, had travelled North to meet Harris and was also 
    present. Most of those who heard him thought that he seemed to radiate power 
    with his every gesture. &quot;Perhaps it was this suggestion of unbounded energy 
    that impressed us most&quot;, wrote one commentator. At the Liverpool Club 
    meeting, he spoke on 'Rotary and its Critics' and later asked Chadwick, 
    which of the talks he thought most suitable, the one on 'The Genesis of 
    Rotary' which he had made at Birmingham earlier on the tour, or this one 
    'Rotary and Its Critics'. As Harris wrote &quot;...his explosive declaration in 
    favour of the (latter) subject caused me to relegate the other to the repair 
    shop...&quot; In practice, he did 'repair' the other talk and used it again at 
    Doncaster and elsewhere on his tour. Arthur Chadwick may well have been 
    aware that in some places, Rotary's image was being tarnished by the 
    writings of eminent commentators and authors among them H L Mencken and G K 
    Chesterton, while the novelist Sinclair Lewis had made the comment that &quot;A 
    Boy Scout is a Rotarian, and a Rotarian is a Boy Scout in long trousers.&quot; </p>

        <td width="50%" valign="top"><style="font-size: 9pt">
        <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">Although such statements probably had little effect on the 
    general public, they did very little for the morale of the distinguished 
    business and professional men who made up the bulk of British Rotary at that 
    time. However, as Paul Harris observed in his address, &quot;There are two types 
    of criticism, constructive and destructive. The constructive critic is the 
    Rotarian critic of other people; the destructive critic is the critic of 
    Rotary.&quot; This comment not only brought forth much laughter but the humour of 
    the remark and other similar comments had another effect. As David Shelley 
    Nichol in his excellent book 'The Golden Wheel' wrote about this speech, 
    &quot;His sense of fun was infectious; to many, and for the first time, came the 
    realisation that the essential principle of belonging to a Rotary Club was 
    nothing less than enjoyment.&quot; It is interesting to note that more recently 
    in 1989, the President of RI, Hugh Archer, adopted as his theme 'Enjoy 
    Rotary!'. Perhaps modern Rotarians needed reminding of their founder's 
    attitude.</p>
    <p align="justify">If beforehand these Rotarians had been wondering what manner 
    of man their Founder really was, this address by Paul Harris left them in no 
    doubt. As the Liverpool bulletin editor observed later, &quot;Let it be said at 
    once that there can be no doubt that he is a very remarkable character 
    indeed. His appearance itself arrests attention, for he has the bright eye 
    of the enthusiast and visionary, combined with the mouth and jaw of the 
    practical man, firm, calm, judicial. The characteristic which struck the 
    present writer most forcibly was the underlying volcanic emotional energy of 
    the man.&quot; Before this tour, Paul Harris might have been the forgotten man of 
    Rotary, but now, in 1928, the impression created by such appearances as this 
    one in Liverpool, had reinstated him as a key player in the movement and his 
    visits were eagerly awaited throughout Britain.</p>
    <p align="justify">After the lunch, he was taken on a tour of Port Sunlight and 
    the Lever Brothers' soap works. He was particularly impressed with the 
    social work being done in the Leverhulme estate village and in the Lever 
    factories. Later, Harris went to see the new Anglican Cathedral which 
    although it was still incomplete, was nevertheless &quot;worthy of special 
    mention.&quot; That night the President Emeritus was the guest of the Liverpool 
    Club President Bill Gibbons before resuming his travels the following day.</p>
    <p align="justify">In 1934 Harris again visited Liverpool, catching the 12.30 
    from Manchester Central. At Lime Street President A W Duncan and a party of 
    eight other local members were on hand to greet their guest. At the Adelphi 
    Hotel, the whole group had a late and informal lunch with the Liverpool Club 
    President while several other Rotarians called in to meet their President 
    Emeritus during the afternoon. They then went down to the Pierhead to board 
    the White Star liner 'Laurentic' for Canada, took tea in one of the ship's 
    lounges and said their goodbyes. Curiously, neither Paul Harris' visit nor 
    this gathering in Liverpool is mentioned in the Liverpool Club's 50th or 
    their 75th anniversary booklets.</p>
    <p align="justify">In 1937 in the company of Manchester Rotarian Will Nixon, 
    Harris again passed through Liverpool en route for the Isle of Man. They 
    spent the night of Friday July 9 in the city before taking the morning boat 
    to the Isle of Man at 10.30. A few days later Paul Harris returned to 
    Liverpool where he was met by members of local clubs. There is a curious 
    reference in the Liverpool Club's anniversary booklet that &quot;Paul Harris paid 
    another fleeting visit to Liverpool in July 1937 on his way back to Chicago 
    after a Convention in Nice. Past President Norman Bollans bade him farewell 
    and was one of the last two Rotarians to see Rotarian Paul on this side of 
    the Atlantic.&quot; Whether this happened as Paul Harris was on his way to the
