		<img class="auto-style25" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/cities/clubs/60glasgow/winnipeg1917pidgeon.jpg" style="float: left">Winnipeg, 
		was *organized on 3 November 1910 and chartered on 13 April 1912. Rotary 
		continued to be called the &quot;National Association of Rotary Clubs&quot; until 
		after the &quot;Charter&quot; of Winnipeg and the convention of 1912 in Duluth, 
		Minnesota, USA. At that time, Rotary became the International 
		Association of Rotary Clubs. London was also chartered that year.<br>
		<br>So, when did Rotary become &quot;international?&quot; Most early clubs and 
		even clubs today have an attachment to their &quot;organizational&quot; date 
		rather than their &quot;Charter.&quot; But, &quot;officially&quot; it would have to be said 
		that in 1910, there was a club &quot;organized&quot; outside of the US. Therefore 
		we were an &quot;international&quot; organization, were we not? But, Rotary did 
		not &quot;officially&quot; call itself &quot;international&quot; until August 1912. Bottom 
		line: Rotary became &quot;International&quot; in 1910!<br><br>And that's your &quot;Four Way Test&quot; for 
		today!<br><br>Winnipeg was asked to send a delegation to the Portland 
		Convention in 1911. President Harris sent a letter to the club after 
		they declined.<br><br>&quot;I am sorry indeed that you cannot have one 
		representative present at the convention. Many of your difficulties 
		would vanish in the enthusiasm and exchange of ideas&quot;.<br><br>So, we know 
		that if Winnipeg had gone to Portland they would have been admitted to 
		Rotary and made the movement International in 1911.<br><br>The club that made Rotary 
		&quot;International&quot;<br><br>Our 
		Winnipeg Rotary Club held it's first meeting on November 3rd, 1910, and 
		again 4 days later making it the oldest Rotary Club outside the United 
		States of America. The club was started by Mr. P A C McIntyre who had 
		met with members from the Chicago Club.<br><br>In December of 1911 the 
		Winnipeg Club became affiliated with the National Association of Rotary 
		Clubs and on April 1912 the charter was signed by Paul Harris, with a 
		charter also issued to the Winnipeg Rotary Club Limited by the Province 
		of Manitoba on September 14th, 1912.<br><br>On July 1st, 1917 the Rev. 
		Leslie D. Pidgeon, a member of the Winnipeg Rotary Club, became 
		President of our International Organization and presided at the 1918 
		convention in Kansas City.<br><br>In the 
		centennial anniversary year, 2010, of the Winnipeg Rotary Club, a new 
		club, the Innisfil RC was chartered meeting in the same place as 
		Canada's first club, the YMCA.&nbsp;<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style25" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/library/rotarian/1940scrapbook/3_winnipeg.jpg" style="float: left">The 
		Winnipeg Rotary story begins when PAC McIntyre (known simply as PAC) 
		brought the idea of a Rotary Club with a colleague A W Morley who with a 
		few friends met in the old YMCA building on Portage Road at 8pm on 
		November 3rd 1910. They met again on the 7th at Morley's office - 601 
		McArthur Buliding where George A Kobold was elected the first President.
		<br><br>Chesley Perry wrote to the club to make contact with Winnipeg. 
		The club at this time didn't have any by-laws and also didn't adopt the 
		ritual of the Rotary year running from July to June - Winnipeg's year 
		followed the calendar. The club would join the, then, national 
		association at $1 per capita.<br><br>Winnipeg's charter is dated 13th 
		April 1912 and officially makes them Club #35 but try telling Winnipeg 
		this! As their 50th anniversary booklet, which covers 1910-60 says, 
		&quot;…and it (Winnipeg) became the 17th Rotary Club&quot;. There was a great deal 
		of disenchantment with the lengthy delay and lack of progress in the 
		Clubs chartering amongst the members.<br><br>Before official 
		recognition, the Club did their own thing, as they were removed from 
		'official' Rotary in Chicago. However, Paul Harris corresponded with the 
		Club, giving sage advice, and wrote &quot;he hoped the members would look 
		beyond tomorrow's business&quot;.<br><br>The 2nd Object of the Winnipeg Club 
		was to &quot;advance the best interests of the city concerned and to spread 
		the support of civic pride and loyalty among and between her citizens 
		and her commercial enterprises&quot;.<br><br>Chicago visited in 1911 with 
		Arthur Sheldon who as guest speaker, gave a 95 minute talk on Trade 
		Schools. On the 14th, National Association Treasurer Mac Martin of 
		Minneapolis Rotary Club also attended the meetings and was happy to give 
		members hints, suggestions and explanations of Rotary.<br><br>Winnipeg 
		was asked to send a delegation to the Portland Convention in 1911. 
		President Harris sent a letter to the club after they declined.<br><br>
		&quot;I am sorry indeed that you cannot have one representative present at 
		the convention. Many of your difficulties would vanish in the enthusiasm 
		and exchange of ideas&quot;.<br><br>So, we know that if Winnipeg had gone to 
		Portland they would have been admitted to Rotary and made the movement 
		International in 1911.<br><br>Harris himself never made it to Winnipeg 
		as the Club couldn't afford the expense.<br><br>By March 1914, the Club 
		had 81 members, though 14 members, including Winnipeg Charter Member PAC 
		McIntyre, were no longer members for non-payment of dues. PAC McIntyre 
		was later re-instated.<br><br>In January 1916 Leslie Pidgeon joined the 
		club and immediately made an impact. He gave his first talk on February 
		9th on community service.<br>By June, Pidgeon had been nominated by the 
		club for the position of International Vice-President. A year later, 
		Pidgeon was International President. He saw the Winnipeg Club take the 
		lead in the formation of the National Council for Education - it helped 
		raise over $10,000. Another new member in 1916 was Charlie Sayer - 
		founder of the Spokes Club.<br><br>1916 also saw the ritual of the 
		weekly meeting commence.<br><br>Sir Harry Lauder addressed the club both 
		in 1918 and 1919 - the latter event was marred when a row erupted 
		between Lauder and Charlie Bamford who accused the Scottish Rotarian of 
		perpetuating his 'farewell tours'. The records show that a 'sharp 
		exchange took place'. 'Bamford was not worsted'.<br><br>The club 
		magazine, &quot;The Whizz&quot; appeared first on November 5th 1918 under William 
		Wallace. <br><br>Delegates didn't make it to the 1919 Convention because 
		of the notorious Winnipeg General Strike. Club members filled in by 
		driving the fire trucks and milk trucks and delivered food.<br><br>
		Winnipeg Rotary Club had many money raising ideas such as their Minstrel 
		Shows. The club supported the Knowles Boys Home. The Manitoba Summer 
		Camp opened in 1924 ably supported by Winnipeg. The club made an 
		enormous impact with their International Goodwill Meetings which began 
		February 1925 with Leslie Pidgeon as the main speaker.<br><br>In 1929 
		Paul Harris was guest speaker. Harris paid tribute to the club at their 
		silver anniversary in 1935. 86 other clubs also sent their best wishes. 
		The Rotary Club of New York said of Winnipeg: - &quot;the first stepping 
		stone towards the Rotary goal of world-wide understanding through a 
		world fellowship of business and professional men united in the ideal of 
		service&quot;. Jerusalem Rotary Club paid their tributes with these words: - 
		&quot;Your Club set the Rotary Wheel in motion on a journey which shall never 
		end until the desired achievement of world peace is accomplished&quot;.<br>
