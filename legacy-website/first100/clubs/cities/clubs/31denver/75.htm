				<img align="left" alt="" border="2" height="242" hspace="10" src="4d2e7bd33c475784381a64e43e50922f.jpg" width="299"></strong>The 
				&quot;75th&quot; is a respectable birthday for an institution in the West, 
				since <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				itself is but 125 years old. If Denver Rotarians wish to 
				contemplate longevity, they can reflect that as a club they have 
				existed well more than half the life of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>, and for practically all of the 
				period in which it could by any definition be termed a modern 
				city. </p>
				<p>A 75th Anniversary history of the <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
				Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName>
				Club is therefore quite appropriate, if only to indicate to 
				newer members that they inherit a distinguished tradition. The 
				principal threads of that tradition are the customs and 
				objectives of Rotary as a world institution; the service of club 
				members to the community, especially its youth; and the 
				providing to all levels of speakers -- local, state, national 
				and international -- of a forum for reaching the business and 
				professional leadership of the city. From Year One, the <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
				Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName> Club podium has been prime 
				habitat for civic leaders of all descriptions. Their talks to 
				Rotary comprise a chronicle of the city as well as of the club, 
				and such records as we have of them chronicle <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
				Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName>'s genuine contribution to urban 
				history. </p>
				<p>A number of fellow Rotarians over the years have attempted to 
				gather club history on various occasions, and their efforts are 
				part of this latest narrative, too. So thanks to Wesley Towne, 
				Dan C. Paxton, J. Stuart Moore, <st1:PersonName
w:st="on">Peter Bowes</st1:PersonName>, Milton Burnet, Lew Barbato, Charles Kall 
				and the other unsung heroes of the files. And to whoever takes 
				the job on in twenty-five more years when our club will be 100!
				</p>
				<p>Thanks also to Rotarian Publisher Dick Schlosberg of The 
				Denver Post for making the time and type for this booklet 
				available, and to Rotarians Robert K. Timothy, Nick Del Calzo, 
				Jerry Tewell, Richard Gooding and C. Grant Wilkins for urging 
				the project along. </p>

				<h3><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> 
				in 1911</h3>
				<p>When pioneer <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				photographer L. C. &quot;Lou&quot; McClure, an avid Rotarian, climbed the 
				State Capitol dome in 1911 to take the old skyline photographs 
				of this booklet, he looked out on a major American city, one of 
				the top 25 in population in the nation. In the fifty years since 
				its frontier founding, 213,000 people had settled at our <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
				Platte</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">River</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> gateway to the 
				central <st1:place w:st="on">Rocky Mountains</st1:place>. </p>
				<p>One of the milestones of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s first decade in this century was 
				the grant of home rule to the city by the State Legislature in 
				1902. At that time, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				occupied 52 square miles of the arid <st1:place w:st="on">Great 
				Plains</st1:place>, a size it essentially maintained until World 
				War II. Mayor Robert Speer, (&quot;Bob&quot; to his Rotary comrades) was 
				elected to the first of his three terms in 1904 and thrust <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				into the national &quot;City Beautiful&quot; movement with a vigorous 
				campaign for parks, parkways and viaducts across the 
				railroad-dominated <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Platte</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
				Valley</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. </p>
				<p>Speer foresaw the implications of the automobile, of which 
				there were only 3,000 in town by <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
				Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName>'s birthday in 1911. He may also 
				have realized those of the airplane, which made its first fitful <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				flight in 1910. He certainly was inordinately proud of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s new Municipal Auditorium, completed 
				after considerable civic hassle, in time for the Democratic 
				National Convention of 1908. </p>
				<p>The year 1911, when the <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Denver 
				Rotary</st1:PersonName>
				Club was founded in the fall, saw a number of symbolic events. 
				The <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">D&amp;F</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Tower</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> was going up, and some of <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s businessmen 
				looked up from their buggies, cars or trams to wonder if the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Queen</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">City</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>'s 
				skyline was getting too tall. A number of businesses that were 
				to flourish for decades got to their feet in 1911 -- Gates 
				Rubber, Van Schaack Realty, Neusteters, City Floral and Mountain 
				Bell, to name a few. </p>
				<p>This was also the year of David Moffat's death. The old First 
				National banker died in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				New York</st1:place></st1:State>, still trying to raise money 
				for his dream of a railroad-across-the-Rockies. His was the 
				symbolic last gasp of a 19th century <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> economy inordinately based on mining, 
				smelting and railroad development. Although these pioneer 
				industries remained of crucial importance to the &quot;<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Queen</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">City</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> of the Plains&quot; far 
				into future years, they were no longer to be unquestionably 
				dominant. </p>
				<p>From now on, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				was to shift roles toward being a center of administrative and 
				professional services that would complement retailing and 
				wholesaling to the wide farming and mining hinterland. 
				Establishment of the Federal Reserve Bank regional headquarters 
				in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				at the turn of the century had settled where mountain West 
				finance would focus. </p>
				<p>Growing agitation for better roads, national parks, and 
				tourist and recreation promotion showed that <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s business community was aware of 
				the region's recreational strengths. To gain national respect 
				for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s 
				image as a beautiful place to live or visit was a key civic 
				desire of the day. To aid in projecting this image, it was a 
				happy fact that national communications were improving. Rotary's 
				birth year was that of the city's first long-distance telephone 
				call, perhaps the best indicator that Denver businessmen were 
				linking to the commercial and professional network of other 
				cities with the message that Denver was just as modern as any of 
				them. </p>
				<p>(Denver Rotarian Charles J. Kall has kindly provided research 
				into the content of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s newspapers in the first full 
				year of Rotary operation, 1912. These new items give the flavor 
				of what Rotarians were talking about in those birthday times:)
				</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Dr. Allen, director of the Bureau of 
				Municipal Research, opined &quot;woman's fundamental part in 
				government is to do efficiently what her position requires of 
				her as an individual member of society No woman has the right to 
				be a problem or a problem creator.&quot; (Remember that women didn't 
				get the vote national until the boys were &quot;over there&quot; in World 
				War I a few years later.)</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Agitation was afoot for state ownership of 
				the coal mines to cut costs to the consumer. (These were the 
				years of &quot;progressive&quot; -- some said &quot;socialist&quot; -- urban and 
				state politics; 1912 was the year Woodrow Wilson snuck in 
				against the GOP split between Teddy Roosevelt and President 
				Taft, who bellied up to a DU podium that year.)</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">To give you a pocketbook feel for 1911, The 
				May Co. advertised $17 suits for men and boys. Highest price in 
				years paid for five lots for the new Oxford Hotel, $75,000, or 
				$1,000 a front foot (which ) established new value for frontage 
				on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address
 w:st="on">17th Street</st1:address></st1:Street> new the new Union Station.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Thomas A. Edison said the greatest 
				achievements of 1911 were the attempt to establish a <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Chinese</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Republic</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>; 
				rapid progress on the <st1:place w:st="on">Panama Canal</st1:place>; 
				improvements in aerial navigation; important discoveries in 
				surgical technique at the Rockefeller Institute, and the near 
				perfection of the diesel engine.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, superintendent of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>
				schools, left a trustees meeting because of the cigar smoke, but 
				said she would never ask trustees not to enjoy themselves at 
				board meetings.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">The Enterprise Liquor Co. at <st1:Street
w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">2200 Larimer St.</st1:address></st1:Street>
				has installed one of the largest individual lighting displays in 
				the city -- eleven 400-candlepower tungsten lamps.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Seventy-five thousand Model-T Fords, four 
				cylinders and five passengers, would be produced this year to 
				sell at $690.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Whooping cough was the most deadly disease 
				in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				last year, with typhoid fever next, and diphtheria, scarlet 
				fever, measles, smallpox and chickenpox still problems.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Officers of the Colorado National Guard are 
				prepared at any time for a call to service in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region> or on the

				<p class="MsoNormal">Mrs. J. J. &quot;Molly&quot; Brown of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City> is a hero of the Titanic on April 
				19. &quot;Tell my <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> friends I'm safe.&quot;</p>
				<p>In short, <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName> 
				was born in an era when the city's and American's insularity was 
				ending for the great mass of the people. As historian Carl 
				Abbott put it in Colorado Magazine in 1973, &quot;by 1900 <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				had successfully completed a transition from small to large city 
				the city's economy had diversified, its public services had been 
				improved and expanded, and its internal structure had grown more 
				complex. </p>
				<p>&quot;<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s 
				businessmen shared the values of their compeers all over the 
				country and its citizens could choose among scores of fraternal 
				societies, ethnic organizations, literary groups, religious and 
				charitable associations and the like. Visitors, indeed, could 
				find little except its setting to differentiate <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> from other American 
				cities.&quot; </p>
				<p>As these American cities of the early century were becoming 
				larger and more complex, their business and professional men 
				felt the need for better communication. They yearned for better 
				forums for effecting civic causes, and better contracts for 
				learning about their counterparts in the nation and the world.
				</p>
				<p>It was from this common need that the National Rotary 
				Association was founded in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>
				in 1905. Its distinctive technique of bringing representatives 
				of the many business and professions together in regular meeting 
				was a solid answer to a growing need of the new urban fathers. 
				They wanted to regain the sense of acquaintance and community 
				they had left in the hometown settings of youth. </p>
				<p><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s 
				business and professional community, against the unfavorable 
				odds of frontier isolation, had in 50 short years moved from 
				tents and huts to being one of the 25 largest cities in the 
				country. So it was perfectly predictable that this hustling 
				group would get wind of the innovative Rotary idea. </p>
				<p>But that the Rotary Club of Denver would survive meager 
				beginnings to become one of the leading movers and shakers of a 
				giant metropolitan area was probably beyond the imagination of 
				G. E. Hancock, a typewriter salesman who in August of 1911 
				inquired of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>
				headquarters as to what the Rotary idea was all about. </p>
				<h3>The Founding Years</h3>
				<p>The first Rotary Club was founded in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>
				in 1905, the brainchild of Paul Harris, a young lawyer who had 
				once lived briefly in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				as a newspaper reporter. When Grattan E. Hancock, manager of the 
				Smith-Premier Typewriter Co. of Denver, wrote to ask about 
				starting a unit in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>, he was sent the <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City> club's 1908 
				brochure on organizing principles surprisingly similar to those 
				of our million-member Rotary International today. </p>
				<p>In 1908, there was emphasis on business solicitation in club 
				rhetoric which later was Rotary grew was gradually outweighed by 
				the ideal of community service. The <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>
				club told Hancock to &quot;cultivate your fellow members and use them 
				to get business, they in turn to do the same for you. The spirit 
				of reciprocity is strong in Rotary.&quot; </p>
				<p>Strict attendance requirements; fines rather than dues as a 
				source of income; membership from all lines of endeavor; and of 
				the top &quot;proprietors, partners, or corporate officers only; 
				regular meetings; Ladies Nights; and a club independent of 
				political influence (to give) moral and educational support to 
				great questions of public interest&quot; -- these were the 
				suggestions to Hancock for his fledgling group. </p>
				<p>By 1911, Rotary had formed a national association of which 
				Paul Harris was president, and he wrote to Hancock on <st1:date Year="1911" Day="1" Month="8"
w:st="on">Aug. 1, 1911</st1:date>: </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;The Rotary Club is a forceful idea and 
				seems to take root wherever it is given a reasonable opportunity 
				. . . so far as the altruistic side of our curriculum is 
				concerned, we can as a National Rotary bring to bear the same 
				insistent force in national matters that as a local Rotary we 
				can on municipal matters. The force of a combined Rotary 
				operated from all the large cities . . . would be almost beyond 
				conception.&quot; </p>
				<p>&quot;... the most vital consideration is the class of people whom 
				you ask to join. Aim to secure the leading businessmen in each 
				line of business. Above all things make no mistake in the 
				banker, the printer, the lawyer, the physician, the dentist, the 
				insurance man, and all those who will get the most direct 
				benefit out of the club . . . some broad lines you should 
				subdivide (in classification) so as to secure that many more 
				members.&quot;</p>
				<p>On Oct. 19, 1912, Hancock; George Harris of the Harris Curio 
				Co.; H. E. Barnes of the Barnes Commercial School; A. L. 
				Chandler of American Multigraph Sales Co.; Sam Dutton, 
				proprietor of the host Albany Hotel, and Robert Willison of 
				Willison and Fallis, architects, held a first discussion of the 
				Rotary idea, followed six days later by another meeting which 24 
				men attended. </p>
				<p>At this time Hancock sent a general letter to further 
				prospects. He quoted from the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>
				club's constitution these three main purposes of a Rotary Club, 
				&quot;the promotion of the business interests of its members, the 
				promotion of good fellowship, and civic and commercial 
				development of the city.&quot; </p>
				<p>&quot;Rotary is a quality organization of quality men producing 
				quality goods. Or if professional, dispensing quality thought, 
				word, and deed. Every member is active.&quot; He underlined &quot;quality&quot; 
				at every point. </p>
				<p>Hancock also listed the 30 Rotary clubs which were in 
				existence before Denver's, namely, Chicago, Philadelphia, New 
				York, San Francisco, Boston, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Detroit, 
				Kansas City, Hartford, Los Angeles, Lincoln, NE; Minneapolis, 
				New Orleans, Pittsburgh, Providence, St. Louis, St. Paul, 
				Seattle, Spokane, Tacoma, Salt Lake City, Winnipeg, Oklahoma 
				City, Buffalo, Duluth, St. Joseph, Mo., Harrisburg, Indianapolis 
				and Newark. </p>
				<p>Thus <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				was soon issued Charter No. 31, in an organization which today 
				mothers 22,144 clubs. By Nov. 2, <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
				Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName> had formally organized, elected 
				officers and directors, and happily sent to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City> a list of 40 
				charter members. </p>
				<p>These included William J. Peete, motor supplies; C. W. 
				Franklin, attorney; John J. Jacobs of the highly popular O. P. 
				Baur Confectionary Co.; George M. Harris, curio shop; Capt. A. 
				H. Hardy of Peters, Cartridge Co.; John L. Hunter of A. T. Lewis 
				Dry Goods Co.; William Cocks, Cocks-Clark Engraving Co.; C. A. 
				Kares, United States Express Co.; and C. G. Adams, filing 
				devices and cabinets. </p>
				<p>Also Sam Dutton of the Albany Hotel; Jesse Wheelock, 
				Northwestern Life Insurance Co.; Fred Syman, Jewelry; A. L. 
				Chandler, American Multigraph Sales Co.; George Turner, Turner 
				Moving and Storage Co.; J. A. Ossen, photo supplies; R. A. 
				Kincaid, Denver Rubber Co.; Carlton A. Moon, Rock Island 
				Railroad Co.; G. T. Hull, Pennsylvania Railroad Co.; W. H. 
				Kistler, Kistler Stationery Co.; Harry E. Barnes, Barnes 
				Commercial College; and Hancock, who was duly formalized as 
				first president. </p>
				<p>Also Theodore Marx, tailor; D. T. Robling, Pittsburgh Water 
				Heater Co.;' C. E. Wells and Clarence G. Campbell of the 
				Knight-Campbell Music Co.; George Mayer, Mayer Hardware Co.; M. 
				J. Leary, Smith-Premier Typewriter Co.; Robert Willison, 
				architect; M. L. Mowry, Rock Island Railroad Co.; Dr. C. W. 
				Clarke, dentist; H. M. Beatty, First National Bank.; John L. 
				Barr, Ayres Milling and Grain Co.; Newcomb Cleveland, insurance; 
				A. T. Lewis, A. T. Lewis Dry Goods Co.; Charles C. <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
				Martin</st1:PersonName>, butter, Frank McLister, paints and 
				glass; Bert C. Reeves, barber, C. R. Root, Barteldes Seed Co.; 
				Dr. George C. Schumaker, dentist; and T. C. Hitchings, 
				investments. These worthies were joined three weeks later by 
				George W. Olinger, undertaker; L. S. Pennington, millinery; Fred 
				W. Standardt, fire insurance; and Henry Isenberg, clothes 
				cleaning. </p>
				<p>In a news story <st1:date Year="1911" Day="20" Month="11" w:st="on">
				Nov. 20, 1911</st1:date>, The Denver Times wrote, &quot;A new 
				organization of representative businessmen has just launched in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>. Its purpose is to concentrate into its 
				membership the executive power of the leading trades and 
				professions in the city. </p>
				<p>&quot;The Rotary Club is to be a sort of mental clearing house of 
				ideas. Membership is limited to one representative of each line 
				of business. Fifty-three men are now enrolled.&quot;</p>
				<p>Simultaneously with formal acceptance of the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> club by the National Rotary Association 
				on Dec. 16, Hancock sent his new flock a letter in which he was 
				already beginning to substitute civic service as a priority 
				motive of membership over business solicitation. </p>
				<p>&quot;We have started with a class of men who are broad-gauged, 
				public-spirited, active toward the welfare of the city and too 
				intelligent to let personal interest predominate in the 
				deliberations of our organization. If there are any such whose 
				ideas permit the predominating of self rather than service, this 
				club is the wrong place for them, for sooner or later they will 
				find themselves out of harmony with their surroundings.&quot; </p>
				<p>&quot;The benefits we will receive (will be) from closer 
				acquaintance (and) meeting with men in diversified pursuits, and 
				from the desire and intention to profit by the motto of our 
				national organization -- 'He Profits Most Who Serves Best.' We 
				must dedicate ourselves to mutual service and the problems and 
				questions of the day. The matter of mutual commercial advantage 
				will just as surely follow as the sun rises and set.&quot; </p>
				<p>In the Dec. 7, 1961, Keyway, the late Frank McLister, at the 
				time one of our last surviving charter members, recalled the 
				first meetings, and was quoted by the late Milton Bernet in a 
				never-published history of these first club decades: </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Our early day meetings were sometimes held 
				at <st1:time Minute="0" Hour="12" w:st="on">noon</st1:time> and 
				sometimes in the evenings to better accommodate the membership . 
				. .. we depended on each other for fun and entertainment and 
				craft talks to build interest in our business endeavors. (Craft 
				talks in which the members spoke about their own businesses were 
				a constant part of programs well into the 1930s.) </p>
				<p>&quot;One of the first meetings I remember was in the Grill Room 
				of the Albany Hotel. In the center of the room was a large tile 
				pool filled with <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
				Rocky</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mountain</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> trout. After the 
				son and prayer we were each provided a fish net and told to 
				select our trout .. one of our members slipped and fell in the 
				pool, to the consternation of the trout.&quot;</p>
				<p>(The club atmosphere and concerns of these early decades can 
				now only be reconstructed by excerpting and summarizing records 
				of early meetings. As throughout our history, these were kept in 
				varying styles, depth and accuracy by whichever club forefather 
				was tapped as scribe, later to be called &quot;Observer.&quot; These 
				records do show that club rules, customs and general interests 
				have endured the years in amazingly consistent fashion. Since 
				our oldest members in 1986 joined the club in the 1930s, it is 
				obvious we cannot count heavily on reminiscence and must depend 
				on extracts from minutes, newsletter, documents files and 
				newspapers to recapture for memory the founding times.) </p>

				<p>The biggest club event of 1917, and indeed in its young 
				history so far, was the presentation of Mme. Shumann-Heink at 
				the Municipal Auditorium on Jan. 31 as a benefit for the huge 
				organ which the club was funding at Mayor Speer's behest. </p>
				<p>The surviving program of the Schumann-Heink concert tells us 
				a good deal about the lifestyle of Rotarians of that day. The 
				good madame in flowery hat adorns the cover with a member's ad 
				for Meadow Gold butter -- &quot;Spread It On Thick.&quot; The program is 
				full of ads, including The Denver Rubber Tire <st1:place
w:st="on">Co.</st1:place> moving to 1554 Broadway; the Hoff-Schroeder Cafeteria; 
				Mountain Motors Co. at 25 Colfax, offering &quot;Packard rhythm,&quot; and 
				Knight-Campbell's at 1615 <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">California</st1:place></st1:State>, offering windup Victrolas. </p>
				<p>&quot;After the Concert, let's go to Baur's at <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address
 w:st="on">1512 Curtis St.</st1:address></st1:Street>&quot; or dancing at the Tally 
				Ho at 1555 Grant, &quot;a floor with a spring to it.&quot; The Broadhurst 
				Shoe Co. was depicting lace-up, high-top ladies evening boots 
				and the Birmingham Specialty Co. &quot;comfort and style guaranteed 
				corsets.&quot; A real estate agency proposed a square brick home with 
				&quot;oak floors throughout&quot; for $4,500. </p>
				<p>As for the concert itself, Mme. Shumann-Heink rendered among 
				other numbers &quot;My Heart Ever Faithful&quot; by Bach; several numbers 
				from Beethoven, Schubert and Strauss; and &quot;Dawn in the Desert,&quot; 
				the &quot;Cry of Rachel&quot; and &quot;The Rosary&quot; by Ethelbert Nevin. </p>
				<p>Shortly after the big concert, the club fathers in their 
				Second Annual Banquet at the DAC in February 1917, presumably 
				enjoyed Miss Alice Forsyth, lyric soprano, rendering &quot;All the 
				Leaves Were Calling Me&quot; or John C. Wilcox, baritone, in &quot;Oh 
				Happy Day.&quot; Max Fabish, manager of the Orpheum Theatre, produced 
				&quot;vaudeville specialties.&quot; </p>
				<p>And after the Colorado Brook Trout and Roast Milk-Fed 
				Chicken, and the Ignnacia Haya Bonita cigars, George Morrison's 
				orchestra offered the one-steps &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; and &quot;Wicki Wacki 
				Woo,&quot; and the foxtrots &quot;Yaaka Hula Hicki Dula,&quot; &quot;Poor 
				Butterfly,&quot; &quot;There's A Little Bit of Bad In Every Good Little 
				Girl&quot; and &quot;Pray for the Lights To Go Out.&quot; </p>
				<p>The lights were indeed going out on a simpler era for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>, its Rotarians and the whole country, 
				but most of the fast-steppers at the ball didn't realize it. 
				Unfortunately, the club minutes for 1918 have disappeared, so we 
				cannot know how Denver Rotarians celebrated the Armistice. But 
				we do know that <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> and its institutions, including the 
				Rotary Club, were shortly injected into a between-the-wars era 
				far different from the innocent tone of the founding years. </p>
				<h3><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				Until WWII</h3>
				<p>World War I, entered with so much innocence as to its 
				eventual significance, was the first watershed event of this 
				century for the nation, for <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> as a core city 
				still very much dominant in its immediate region, and even for a 
				165-member service club. But the war's effects were only slowly 
				apparent at the regional and local levels. </p>
				<p>Everyday life was pretty much the same as the city's 
				population grew by 20 percent from <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
				Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName>'s founding in 1911 to 256,000 
				people by 1920. These good folk were getting around in 30,000 
				cars as well as by the streetcar lines that still dominated the 
				city's transport. The last annexation of land to the core city 
				had been in 1902, and there was not another until this period 
				ends with World War II in 1941. </p>
				<p>As our before-cited historian Carl Abbott points out: </p>
				<p>&quot;The economic and social stagnation of <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Colorado</st1:place></st1:State> after 1918 
				deprived <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				of an external stimulus for change. The growth of its population 
				slowed, especially after 1910, and the increase . . . to 332,412 
				in 1940 took place within the (city's) physical framework 
				established in the previous two decades.&quot;</p>
				<p>Public services remained essentially the same in this era, 
				commerce was the core of the economy, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s reach into its hinterland was 
				unchanged, its ethnic neighborhoods and the business district 
				stable. The middle-class Anglo-residential area, undoubtedly the 
				habitat of most Rotarians, grew into the quarter of the city 
				marked out as early as the 1880s for elite residences -- Park 
				Hill, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Montclair</st1:place></st1:City>, Cherry Creek, and the Country Club.
				</p>
				<p>We must remember that <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Colorado</st1:place></st1:State>, and hence <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>, and hence Rotary, did not &quot;boom&quot; 
				between the wars. Marginal mines and farmlands, forced into 
				heavy production by the war, went &quot;bust,&quot; with an era of low 
				prices and displaced people. The hard times of the '20s turned 
				into the worse times of the '30s with its Great Depression and 
				New Deal politics. Yet if there was not spectacular growth, 
				there was plenty of civic change, and considerable innovation 
				whose mass impact was only realized much later. </p>
				<p>Leroy R. Haren notes in his history, &quot;<st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Colorado</st1:place></st1:State> and Its People,&quot; that &quot;the skyline 
				of the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				business district was greatly transformed during the decade 
				following the War. The most notable building activity occurred 
				in 1926-27 when the Republic, the Security, the Midland Savings, 
				the Cosmopolitan Hotel, and the Continental Oil buildings were 
				erected. In 1929 the set-back, skyscraper-patterned <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Telephone</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Building</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> arose; and in 1932 the 
				crescent-shaped Municipal building was completed.&quot; </p>
				<p>There was a steady increase in the number of cars, from 
				30,000 in 1920 to 100,000 in 1940. The first radio station, KLZ, 
				went on the air in 1922, the first sound film was shown at the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Paramount</st1:place></st1:City>
				in '29, and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
				Stapleton</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Airport</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> was dedicated the 
				same year. </p>
				<p>The airport was named for Ben Stapleton, who was to dominate 
				the city's political life through the whole period as mayor from 
				1923 to 1947, with a time out for one term in the early '30s. 
				Stapleton, like Robert Speer before him, was an enthusiastic 
				Rotarian and cooperated with the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> club in a continuous manner unlike any 
				administration since. He was particularly proud of the City 
				Hall, completed in 1932, and of the numerous expansions of the 
				city's park and street system, including the famous mountain 
				parks, engineered by his lieutenant, George Cranmer. Despite the 
				economic problems of the times, the beautification of the <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> oasis was a 
				persistent theme of the era. </p>
				<p>In 1917, just as <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
				entered the war, the Russian Revolution introduced an era of 
				political unrest and agitation throughout the world that had 
				some fretful offshoots in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s first concerns 
				about &quot;Reds&quot; and &quot;Bolsheviks.&quot; Super-patriotism inspired by the 
				war and militant labor agitation springing from the postwar 
				economic slump led to labor violence in the Denver Tramway 
				strike of 1920. Later <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> had an 
				overemphasized flirtation with the Ku Klux Klan. </p>
				<p>Consolidation of water supply under the city's Water Board 
				and of the utilities in Public Service Co. were early marks of 
				the period, as were a clean-air campaign, founding of the 
				Community Chest, the coming of natural gas and the opening of 
				the long-dreamed Moffat Railroad tunnel through the Rockies in 
				1928. The 1930s saw, against a backdrop of the nationwide 
				Depression and extensive drought in eastern Colorado, the great 
				Cherry Creek flood of '33 and the massive snowstorm of '36; the 
				first transcontinental air service to Denver, and the beginning 
				of skiing at Winter Park. </p>
				<p><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> 
				had its share of Depression hardship -- 10,000 families 
				qualified for relief in 1933, and there was plenty of political 
				turmoil as the New Deal began its injection of federal relief 
				funds and legislation. Indeed, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Colorado</st1:place></st1:State>'s relief payments were halted for a 
				time in 1934 when the conservative legislature under the prod of 
				Governor Ed Johnson refused to match the feds' largesse. But 
				there was good news for Rotarians to chew over, too. The first 
				water from the Western Slope came into <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> in 1936, and the 
				Colorado Big Thompson Project was begun, which was to 
				revolutionize <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s northern 
				hinterland. </p>
				<p>When the war started in <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> 
				in 1939, mining revived in the mountains, and federal employment 
				expanded in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> with the Remington 
				Ordinance plant, later the nucleus of the present <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Federal</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. 
				From 2,000 federal employees in 1930, the number grew to 6,500 
				by 1940, and was to triple as <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
				entered the war. </p>
				<p>Many of the newcomers settled in the suburbs and the <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address
 w:st="on">West 6th Avenue</st1:address></st1:Street> &quot;freeway: was built to 
				connect the federal activity in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Lakewood</st1:place></st1:City>
				and Lowry Field. By 1940 the Denver Planning Commission fretted 
				that the suburbs were growing five times as fast as the core 
				city, though the latter still had twice the gross total. The 
				Hispanic population of the city was not at 12,000, almost 
				entirely the product of this era between the wars, and the 
				federal Works Progress Administration issued a study raising the 
				question of substandard treatment. </p>
				<p>As the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
				came nearer to war, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
				Fitzsimmons</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Hospital</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, Lowry Field, <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Camp</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
				Hale</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
				in the mountains and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
				Fort</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Carson</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> near the Springs 
				began to be more apparent factors in the community, and many of 
				their servicemen began to enjoy the hospitality of the city. </p>
				<p>Summing up this period from War to War, Gerald D. Nash has 
				written in his new book, &quot;The American West Transformed,&quot; that 
				at the end of the 1930s, the mountain West, of which <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				was prototypical, was still economically dependent on the 
				industrial East, had a minority position in American politics, 
				and imported almost every aspect of its culture. </p>
				<p>&quot;On the eve of World War II, the West reflected the cautious 
				and hesitant outlook about the future that swept <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region> as the result of the 
				economic crisis . . . within four years, wartime experiences 
				transformed the erstwhile mood of pessimism into undaunted 
				optimism.&quot; </p>
				<p>For other details on this fascinating period, consult Lyle 
				Dorset's &quot;The Queen City,&quot; which exists due to the generosity of 
				Rotarian Ben Stapleton Jr. </p>
				<p>The <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName> 
				Club, expanding locally on a base of custom adopted in the 
				founding era and deeply influenced by Rotary International's 
				evolving role as a world-class institution, reacted to this 
				changing between-wars America in a manner we shall now try to 
				reconstruct. </p>
				<h3>Rotary Between Wars</h3>
				<p>On <st1:date Year="1916" Day="1" Month="1" w:st="on">Jan. 1, 
				1916</st1:date>, just before the First World War began, <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
				Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName>
				had 165 members. In January 1942, just after <st1:place w:st="on">
				Pearl Harbor</st1:place>, the count was 332, almost precisely 
				doubled. (For comparison, today in 1986 it's almost 600.) </p>
				<p>Among the highlights of the club's history in this period 
				were the beginning of its organized work with Denver youth which 
				led in our time to Denver Boys and Denver Girls; the hosting of 
				the Rotary International conventions in 1926 and 1941; a 
				significant expansion of the club's regional work through 
				development of district conferences, inter-city visits and 
				sponsorship of new clubs; and formal organization of the Ladies 
				of Rotary in 1926-27. Add to this regular promotion of and 
				attendance at international conventions. </p>
				<p>The last regular minutes of the meetings of <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
				Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName> were taken in 1919-21. After 
				that, from the evidence of the club's fragmentary files, minutes 
				were abandoned and newsletters in the tradition of today's 
				Keyway, often more pointed toward announcing the next meeting 
				than reporting the last, became the club tradition. They moved 
				slowly from mimeographed single sheets to today's printed 
				wonders. </p>
				<p>The documents are full of Rotary idealism, messages depicting 
				the service activities of the club, the founding of Rotary 
				International's specialties, and the emphasis on attendance and 
				civic service as the core of Rotarian life. Club customs were 
				such that a Rotarian of today would have felt at home at most of 
				the last generations meetings, whether they were at the old 
				Albany, Shirley Savoy or Cosmopolitan Hotels, or at various 
				institutions throughout the city. But the concerns of those 
				meetings were different in detail from those of today despite 
				the core of common principle and practice. </p>

				<p>In 1923, <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName> 
				began its long record of service to youth in the community, 
				although the present structures of Denver Boys and Denver Girls 
				were not organized until after World War II. The early-day youth 
				work was described by the former club executive secretary, 
				Wesley Towne, on the occasion of the club's 50th anniversary as 
				follows: </p>
				<p>&quot; . . . at that time (1923) there was much discussion as to 
				whether we should contribute to some existing organizations or 
				select a special activity and devote our energies to some 
				particular work with boys. We began in a modest way to assist 
				underprivileged boys in the high schools of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				to buy adequate lunches, pay car fare, and furnish shoes, 
				clothing and other needed items. The money given these boys was 
				a gift and they did not assume any obligation. </p>
				<p>&quot;In the early 1930s, it was decided to enlarge our endeavor 
				and, while not forgetting the economic side, place some 
				responsibility on those receiving assistance from us, so 
				scholastic standards were put in effect. During the Depression 
				years we had as high as 127 boys on our scholarship rolls. Each 
				scholarship boy was assigned a Rotarian sponsor for counsel and 
				guidance, creating the mentor tradition in youth work which has 
				been the distinctive contribution of <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
				Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName>
				in this field ever since.&quot;</p>
				<p>By the 1920s, the international Rotary organization had grown 
				apace with its units such as <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>. The 2,000th club charter (of 
				which <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s 
				was 31) was issued in 1925, many of them overseas. The 
				international organization was becoming more effective in giving 
				local clubs guidance, in setting common standards for club 
				performance, and in urging attendance at national conventions.

				<p>Rotary International has required additional hotel space if

 w:st="on">Denver</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
				stadium, the entertainment including, to quote the program, &quot;a 
				kaleidoscopic vision of the universal and international 
				character of Rotary, tinged with the atmosphere of Western 
				Indian days.&quot; </p>
				<p>Aiding in the &quot;tinging&quot; were members of the Zuni, Navajo and 
				Blackfeet tribes; the Black Horse Cavalry from Fort D. A. 
				Russell in Cheyenne; the Denver Municipal Band, Rotarian H. 
				Everett Sachs, conductor; about 1000 Highlander Boys, Boy 
				Scouts, DeMolays, and Denver High School cadets; and numerous 
				members of Rotary and other service clubs from the Queen City 
				and its neighbors -- in all a cast of 2,000, quite an 
				achievement in hospitality. </p>
				<p>As Wesley Towned recapped it, &quot;The plenary sessions of the 
				convention were held in the Auditorium, and the House of 
				Friendship across the street in what was then known as the Bon 
				Ton Dance Hall. The entire block of <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">
				Champa Street</st1:address></st1:Street>
				from 14th to 15th was not opened to traffic.&quot; The municipal 
				organist, Clarence H. Reynolds, thumped forth in a manner that 
				would have delighted Mayor Speer, including a ditty written just 
				for Denver by a Kansas visitor, &quot;In Denver, In Denver, Your 
				Air's so wonderfully clear, No wonder it makes us, All wish we 
				could live here.&quot; </p>
				<p>The ladies of <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName>,

				The Denver Post greeted the &quot;from 12 to 15,000&quot; visitors with a 
				special edition. In all, the <st1:date Year="1926" Day="8" Month="7" w:st="on">
				July 8, 1926</st1:date>, newsletter concluded, the convention 
				just closed was a great success from &quot;the standpoint of the 
				goodwill created toward <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> and the West.&quot; The 
				club that was just 15 years old felt it had made the Rotary big 
				time. </p>
				<p>By the mid-20's, club bulletins were beginning to stress 
				District Conferences, most of them at Colorado Springs in the 
				manner of this day, and were listing club members' makeups at 
				other clubs across the country. Attendance at international 
				conventions was also being urged. The one following <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s in 1926 was held in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">

					May 13 - After a speech on the presumed ability of the 
					British government to control strikes, the Observer said &quot;in 
					view of the recent developments in regard to labor in our 
					country (strikes and organization of the CIO) it seems to be 
					the consensus of opinion that some such position must 
					inevitably be taken by our government.&quot; (A fiscal report for

					character.&quot; </li>
					<li>
					Oct. 21 - L. Ward Bannister explained a government proposal 
					to expand activity in natural resources conservation, which 
					led the Observer to rule that &quot;Regulation is a many-headed 
					dragon. We have just seen a financial debacle in the Stock 
					Market by the academic regulation of this market by the

					Feb. 16 - Will Grant, with the logic of Aristotle, showed

				</ul>
				<p>At this point, club records begin to be dominated by the 
				forthcoming international convention, scheduled for June 15-20. 
				In 1980, Lew Barbato and committee assembled a history of the 
				club to celebrate Rotary International's 75th birthday, and the 
				following description of the 1941 convention and aftermath is 
				taken from their excellent work: </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;The convention theme was &quot;The Rotarian 
				Amid World Conflict&quot; and a highlight was a concert and 
				dedication of the Red Rocks Theater. On the program was Miss 
				Helen Jepson of the Metropolitan Opera, the Denver Municipal 
				Orchestra under Henry Everett Sachs, and a Denver Festival 
				Chorus of 100 voices under the direction of Rotarian John C. 
				Kendel. The program was broadcast internationally throughout the <st1:place w:st="on">
				Western Hemisphere</st1:place>. </p>
				<p>&quot;Plenary sessions were in the Denver Auditorium as well as 
				the Reception and the President's Ball. The House of Friendship 
				was located in the newly completed annex of our Auditorium . . . 
				total attendance was 9,817.&quot;</p>
				<p>A memorial to the convention was to have been dedicated on 
				top of <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mt.</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
				Evans</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
				during the festivities, but bad weather intervened and it wasn't 
				until August that the following plaque was installed: </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Presented by the members of Rotary Clubs 
				in the 113th District, Rotary International, dedicated to the 
				service and pleasure of all mankind. Unveiled by Armando de 
				Arruda Pereira, <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Sao Paulo</st1:City>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">
				Brazil</st1:country-region></st1:place>, president Rotary 
				International, 32nd Annual Convention, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Denver</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Colorado</st1:State></st1:place>, 
				June, 1941.&quot; </p>
				<p>It would be nice to leave our Rotarians in the friendly if 
				somewhat breezy atmosphere on the top of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Mt.</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Evans</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
				celebrating their successful convention attended by Rotarians 
				from 26 countries. But the winds of war were also blowing. The 
				first meeting of the new administration on the next July 3 was 
				an Independence Day Rally featuring the commandant of the new 
				Denver Ordinance Plant, the next heard more discussion of the 
				Nazi &quot;fifth column&quot; and later the club heard again from Clark 
				Eichelberger of the League of Nations Association. Said the 
				Observer, &quot;Anything that happens in the world is our affair, and 
				this war is our war and has been from the start!&quot; </p>
				<p>But Rotarians were ambivalent as they watched the Western 
				European nations have at each other. After a discussion led by 
				Dr. Ben Cherrington of DU in October, the Observer wrote, 
				&quot;Regardless of the winner, and it could be either, the world 
				will be sorry place. We will be in the driver's seat, the most 
				powerful nation in the world, unless we get further into it and 
				deplete our resources and economy as the other nations are 
				doing.&quot; </p>
				<p>On <st1:date Year="1941" Day="4" Month="12" w:st="on">Dec. 4, 
				1941</st1:date>, the club celebrated its 30th birthday, with T. 
				Chester Hitchings, William R. McFarland, M. Eliott Houston and 
				Lewis J. Todhunter enacting the high points of the three 
				decades. The Charter members cut a huge birthday cake, and went 
				home unaware that the Japanese were marshaling for the attach on <st1:place w:st="on">
				Pearl Harbor</st1:place> three days later. As club president 
				Frank P. Spratlen Jr. put it at year's end, &quot;Never has <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
				Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName>
				had better opportunities for real service ... each of us should 
				highly resolve to work in complete accord, with unreserved 
				strength, for our national welfare, to the ultimate victory of 
				our beloved country and our way of life. </p>
				<p>The Rotarians could not foresee that ultimate victory would 
				be achieved, but that the way of life of their country, city and 
				club would be fundamentally altered in the achieving. </p>
				<h3>World War II and the West</h3>
				<p>It is generally agreed by historians that World War II was 
				the most important single event in the history of the mountain 
				West, and hence of Denver as its growing capital. That is, if by 
				&quot;important&quot; you mean bringing permanent changes to the largest 
				number of people. </p>
				<p>The massive investment of federal funds and the in-migration 
				of thousands of people, both to support the all-out war effort 
				in the West, affected the region and its capital far more 
				profoundly than had other national traumas such as the Gold 
				Rush, the Civil War, the silver strikes, the First World War or 
				the Great Depressions. From 1940 to 1945, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Colorado</st1:place></st1:State>'s total income more than 
				doubled from $617 million to $1,317 million, and <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s population 
				increased 20 percent, by 100,000 people, including for the first 
				time significantly large numbers of Afro-American and 
				Hispanic-American citizens. </p>
				<p>As to the processes of military service and effort, much was 
				reminiscent of World War I - the training camps, the pressure on 
				farmers and miners to increase production, the bond drives, the 
				hospitality canteens, the anxious ear for the doorbell and &quot;bad 
				news.&quot; Some of the Denver Rotarians could be excused for 
				thinking they had been this way before, since by now they were 
				one of the older organizations in a booming city, few of which 
				went back to the &quot;last war.&quot; </p>
				<p>In economic life, the change in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				was far more intrusive than anything that had happened in World 
				War I. The grain mills, sugar refineries and meat-packers were 
				back at capacity after the long depression; mining equipment 
				companies re-geared to war material. New war plants included 
				Remington at the present-day <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Fed</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, 
				with 20,000 employees making munitions - half of them women! The 
				Rocky Mountain Arsenal had 14,000 at work on chemical weapons, 
				with no one questioning the effect on the environment. Desert <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				even had a fling at shipbuilding, producing pre-fab parts for 31 
				destroyer escorts and 301 landing craft. These were shipped out 
				by rail to <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Mare</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
				Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
				in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">San Francisco</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Bay</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> for assembly and launching. </p>
				<p>Many of the war workers were minorities, including women, 
				with all that portended for changes in habits and customs that 
				had been in place for the hundred years since the Anglo 
				frontier. Unlike World War I, there was a huge establishment and 
				revival by the government of a military complex that was to be a 
				permanent part of the postwar Colorado scene - Lowry Field and 
				Buckley Naval Air Station, Camp Hale for the mountain troops, 
				Fort Carson for the infantry and tank corps, military training 
				programs at the region's colleges, Fitzsimons General Hospital. 
				Many of the service men and women who went through these centers 
				and sampled <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Colorado</st1:place></st1:State>'s 
				wartime hospitality came back as permanent residents after the 
				war. </p>
				<p>According the George V. Kelly in his history of Denver 
				administration, &quot;The Old Gray Mayors,&quot; Rotarian May Ben looked 
				out on the Civic Center throngs one 1946 after-war afternoon and 
				said, &quot;If these people would just go back where they cam from, 
				we wouldn't have any problems here.&quot; NO doubt Stapleton mirrored 
				the &quot;growth&quot; shock of some of his Rotary fellows. In 1940, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				had 322,000 people and the surrounding counties (Adams, 
				Arapahoe, <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Boulder</st1:place></st1:City> and Jefferson) 
				totaled 123,000. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				was still ahead more than 2 to 1. </p>
				<p>In just 10 years, by 1950, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				had 416,000 for a growth rate of 29 percent. But the suburbs out 
				on the &quot;crabgrass frontier&quot; had 196,000, for a 60 percent 
				increase. Between 1950 and 1960, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				grew 19 percent to 494,000, but the suburbs were up 122 percent 
				to 435,000, almost level with the core! </p>
				<p>The period between <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s hosting of Rotary International 
				in 1941, just before <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region> was thrust into the war, and 
				1966 when it again welcomed an international convention was the 
				birth period for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				as a megalopolis. Among the significant indicators of this was 
				the growth of automobile traffic - 153,000 vehicles in metro <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> in 1946, compared to 540,000 in 1960. 
				(A million plus today [1986]!) The first King Soopers market 
				catering to the car went up in 1947, the last trolley gave way 
				to buses in 1950, the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Cherry</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
				Creek</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Shopping Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> opened in 
				1953, University Hills in 1955. Ike signed the <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address
 w:st="on">Interstate Highway</st1:address></st1:Street> bill in '56. </p>
				<p>Elwood Brooks began to challenge the <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address
 w:st="on">17th Street</st1:address></st1:Street> banks with low-interest 
				consumer loans in 1943, Ben Stapleton was defeated by Quigg 
				Newton for may in 1947, with the help of Rotarian Palmer Hoyt at 
				a modernized Denver Post. And all sorts of other gauntlets were 
				being thrown before old <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> business and political practices, but 
				within, generally speaking, the ownership patterns familiar to 
				pre-war Rotarians. </p>
				<p>The war-induced surge in mining and farming might have 
				drifted off as in the 1920s except for the international 
				situation. This saw the Marshall Plan and the Cold War with the 
				Russians turn to hot with the Korean War of 1950. This 
				reinvigorated all the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Colorado</st1:place></st1:State>
				military installations. Dwight Eisenhower was elected in 1952 
				and helped his wife's hometown bring the water across the 
				mountains (Big Thompson, 1954; Roberts Tunnel, 1964) and get the 
				Air Academy, 1954-58. The year Ike headquartered his first 
				campaign at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Brown</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Palace</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, 
				1952, was also that of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s first television broadcast, the 
				beginning of a major shift in the city's communications 
				structure. </p>
				<p>In 1955, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				voters OK'd a $25 million water bond issue that lifted its 
				restrictions on service to the suburbs, and in the next year the <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
				Martin</st1:PersonName>
				plant set up shop and started the <st1:place w:st="on">Front 
				Range</st1:place>
				on its way to space glory. </p>
				<p>In 1960, the Denver Urban Renewal Authority began planning to 
				revamp half the downtown business core. There were then six 
				buildings on the <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> skyline higher than 
				320 fee, the limit placed by a restriction that went back to the 
				1920s. (The restriction had been lifted with the immediate 
				postwar advent of the Texas Murchisons and Bill Zeckendorf with 
				their <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Mile</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">High</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> club building, the latter built on the 
				site of the Old Guard's torn-down brownstone citadel. Six high 
				buildings in 1960 and 18 by 1970! It was the decade of the crane 
				as the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Colorado</st1:place></st1:State> state bird. </p>
				<p>Speaking of the war and postwar developments as they affected <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Colorado</st1:place></st1:State> and <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>, Ubbelhode, Benson 
				and Smith in their &quot;A Colorado History&quot; sum it this way: </p>
				<p>&quot;Startling changes came with this federal infusion of jobs, 
				agencies and money, including more intense urbanization of the <st1:place w:st="on">
				Front Range</st1:place> corridor, a higher standard of living, 
				the influx of highly skilled workers and different political, 
				social and cultural attitudes. . . . <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Colorado</st1:place></st1:State>
				made the transition from an extractive economy based upon mining 
				and agriculture of the 19th century and pre-World War II years 
				to a sophisticated service economy of the 1950s and beyond. It 
				did this without going through the intermediate state of heavy 
				industrialization typical of the eastern <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&quot;</p>
				<p>In 1930, mining and agriculture accounted for 31 percent of 
				total <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Colorado</st1:place></st1:State> employment; in 
				1970, those traditional sectors accounted for only 6 percent. 
				The comparable figures for manufacturing were a stable 18 and 15 
				- manufacturing held its own. But for the government, trade and 
				services sector, a whopping increase from 20 to 50 percent 
				showed the basic change that the Second World War brought to <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Colorado</st1:place></st1:State>. </p>
				<p>These changes had a fundamental effect on <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
				Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName>, which grew in size but did not 
				change its habitual customs or practices. However, the character 
				of its membership and of the issues it was forced to confront, 
				and the size of its operations, were very much affected. We turn 
				back to the documents and Keyways of the period to get a taste 
				of this substantial change in a club which had yet to live more 
				than half its life up to age 75. </p>

				<h3>Rotary in World War II</h3>
				<p>A Rotarian who attended international conventions in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> in 1941 and 1966 visited two very 
				different cities. The first was a large but rather quiet 
				regional center with one or two tall buildings breaking the 
				clean air of its skyline, surrounded by some small towns, the 
				whole conveying the compact atmosphere of an isolated city oasis 
				on the arid plains. The second was the core of an obviously 
				exploding metropolis, buildings going up everywhere on a skyline 
				often obscured by traffic smog, with freeways slashing out 
				through smog, with freeways slashing out through suburbs that 
				stretched along the Front Range mountains and crept up their 
				ravines. One could argue that in these 25 years <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> had gone through more of a 
				transformation than its first quarter-century had brought to the 
				frontier emptiness of 1859. </p>
				<p>No more than a third of our current membership belonged to <st1:PersonName
w:st="on">Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName> during this period, its &quot;middle age&quot; 
				from birthday 30 to 55. And most of these joined in the 1960s. 
				So to recapture the flavor, we cannot count on the personal 
				recollection of a majority but must turn again to the weekly 
				Keyways, extracting them regularly for the World War II period 
				and intermittently from then on until we get to days that more 
				of you remember. </p>
				<h3>1942</h3>
				<ul type="disc">
					<li>
					Jan. 8 - After hearing Dr. Ludwig Hamburger describe the 
					absolute control of all Business and Labor in effect in Nazi 
					Germany, the restrictions placed on us in this country seem 
					like the rules of a Parcheesi game. It is pretty certain 
					that we are going to have more now that we have a rather 
					serious job to do. </li>
					<li>
					Jan. 15 - A message from international president Tom Davis 
					stresses that Rotary International expects individual 
					Rotarians to be loyal, devoted, serving citizens of their 
					own countries, fighting for &quot;home and heritage, ideals and 
					traditions, and common decency.&quot; </li>
					<li>
					Jan 29 - Rotarian Caleb F. &quot;Turk&quot; Gates Jr., chancellor of 
					DU, tells us what the universities must do in the Defense 
					and War program, &quot;and even more in the Peace that will 
					follow.&quot; . . . </li>
					<li>
					March 5 - Mrs. Charles C. Gates describes the Dec. 7 attack 
					on <st1:place w:st="on">Pearl Harbor</st1:place>, which she 
					and her husband experienced. </li>
					<li>
					April 9 - Ben Cherrington and other DU professors analyzed 
					&quot;Key Spots in the Grand Strategy of the War,&quot; of more than 
					ordinary interest on the day we learned that the gallant 
					defenders of <st1:place w:st="on">Bataan</st1:place> had at 
					last succumbed. </li>
					<li>
					July 9 - Sgt. Ray Shane of the Denver Police Department gave 
					a graphic description of the civil defense organization, 
					plan and preparations that have been completed for 
					safeguarding our city. Honorary Memberships, Military 
					Service are being extended to more members. </li>
					<li>
					July 23, 30 - John G. Gates of Gates Rubber Co. and Frank A. 
					Kemp of Great Western Sugar Co. give back-to-back talks on 
					the shortages in the country's rubber and sugar. </li>
					<li>
					Sept. 17 - Col. Harvey Burwell, commanding officer of Lowry 
					Field, emphasized <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
      w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s importance to the all-out war 
					effort, and left us thinking of our future importance in the 
					world of aviation that is sure to come. </li>
					<li>
					Oct. 1 - <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
      w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> has a War Chest goal of $1,245,195 
					to meet U.S.O., Navy Relief War Prisoners Fund and regular 
					Community Chest needs. Rotary is pitching in. </li>
					<li>
					Oct. 8 - The Keyway lists 36 sons of Rotarians in the 
					service in an &quot;Honor Roll.&quot; </li>
					<li>
					Oct. 22 - Dr. Osgoode S. Philpott solicits club support for 
					the Blood Bank. Members are urged to turn out their personal 
					cars and ride streetcars to take orphans to the annual 
					Orphans Party; wartime regulations forbid leasing buses 
					running on scarce rubber. </li>
					<li>
					Dec. 3 - Four of the finest specimens you ever saw talked of 
					their experiences -- a veteran of <st1:City
     w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Dunkirk</st1:place></st1:City>, a sailor who 
					survived the sinking of a destroyer, a Marine who fought in 
					the battle of Midway and a friendly Norwegian flyer.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>1943</h3>
				<ul type="disc">
					<li>
					Feb. 13 - Ladies Night at the Silver Glade of the Cosmo 
					included Milton Shrednik's orchestra and the singing of Mary 
					Kendel, Lauretta Louise and Ivan Schooley. The bridge 
					players enjoyed the orchestra, too </li>
					<li>
					Feb. 18 - Rotary International appeals for support for its 
					new Foundation, and the club receives a surprise visit from 
					Gen. Carlos P. Romulo of the <st1:country-region
     w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
     			   -- &quot;a little package sometimes contains a lot of power.&quot; </li>
					<li>
					Feb. 25 - Congrats to the Ladies of Rotary for selling more 
					than $50,000 in war bonds at last week's meeting. The 
					speaker talks about aviation; imagine that we're only 60 
					hours away from anyplace on the globe! </li>
					<li>
					March 11 - Rotary scholarships extended to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
					Fitzsimons General</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
					Hospital</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
     			   will now also be offered at Lowry Air Force Technical School.
					</li>
					<li>
					April 1 - The people were again cheered by news that 
					MacArthur's flyers have won a victory off the coast of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
					New Guinea</st1:place></st1:country-region>
     			   -- has this one man acquired more military knowledge than any 
					other? </li>
					<li>
					May 20 - Friends, for one buck you can buy a copy of Wendell 
					Wilkie's &quot;One World,&quot; which you all should read. </li>
					<li>
					July 8 - The speech topic, &quot;What Will We Have to Eat Next 
					Winter?&quot; The answer seemed to be that we won't have the same 
					things that we didn't have last winter, only more so. </li>
					<li>
					July 15 - Sen. Joseph Ball of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
					Minnesota</st1:place></st1:State>
     			   and Congressman Albert A. Gore of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
					Tennessee</st1:place></st1:State>
     			   talk about the Hatch-Ball resolution favoring formation of a 
					United Nations after the war. </li>
					<li>
					July 29 - The program was the crew of the Memphis Bell, a 
					Flying Fortress that had completed 25 missions over Nazi 
					Germany. We can all respond to those fellows by buying more 
					War Bonds. </li>
					<li>

				</ul>
				<p>(This was the beginning of one of <st1:PersonName
w:st="on">Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName>'s most ambitious projects, seeking to 
				get Rotary International to move to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>. The club prevailed on the 
				Archdiocese of Denver to more <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Mt.</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Olivet</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Cemetery</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, 
				thus gaining an option on the present site of the Botanic 
				Gardens for a Rotary International headquarters. Sandy Buell 
				designed a beautiful headquarters building and tower, and 
				subcommittees of RI accepted the idea. </p>
				<p>Alas, at the decisive moment at the 1946 national convention 
				in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Atlantic City</st1:place></st1:City>, 
				Rotary's venerated founder Paul Harris put his support behind <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>. Lew Barbato's 1980 history of the 
				club quotes Harris as follows: </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;I have been asked whether it is true, as 
				has been secretly reported, that I prefer <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City> 
				as a permanent home for Rotary International. No, I have never 
				said that I prefer <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City> . . . I am 
				sometime spoken of as the 'Father of Rotary.' If there is any 
				justification for the usage of that term, I am the 'Father of 
				all of the Rotary Clubs of the World, as well as the 'Father of 
				the Rotary Club of Chicago.' To be fair to all my children is 
				manifested in my duty and desire. </p>
				<p>&quot;Most naturally it will be pleasing to me if <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City> be selected as the 
				permanent home of Rotary International. In Chicago Rotary was 
				born. In <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City> I worked and lived 
				for nearly a half a century. In <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>
				I married my Scotch lassie Jeanie, and in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>
				we have built our home and in it entertained hundreds of 
				Rotarians from all parts of the world. To do this has been the 
				joy of our lives. We have not been blessed with children of our 
				own, so we adopted Rotary. In <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City> w have established our <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Friendship</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Garden</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> in honor of Rotarians visitors. .. 
				. with all these sacred memories in mind, we naturally prefer <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City> ... God bless you my friends and help 
				you and may he cause his face to shine upon you.&quot;</p>
				<p>Needless to say, the convention voted against <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> and for <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>'s suburb <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Evanston</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Ill.</st1:State></st1:place>, 
				and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> 
				was unable to get that decision reversed the next year.)</p>

     			   had a very interesting story of his nine-man Marine team of 
					the South Pacific. (Later in the day when Nixon tossed the 
					opening pitch to Mayor Ben Stapleton, the mayor sung so hard 
					he either fell or bit the dust to avoid a bad pitch). ( </li>
					<li>
					May 29 - Mayor Ben received our appreciation by all standing 
					and applauding for the many fine things he has done for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
					Denver</st1:place></st1:City>

				<p>Thus ended the Stapleton era in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">

				politics which had begun in 1923. Although Mayor Newton soon 
				became a member, and though he and his immediate successors -- 
				Will F. Nicholson, Dick Batterton and Tom Currigan -- made 
				regular reports to the club during the next years, City Hall and 
				Rotary were not again to be in as fine tune as in the days of 
				Speer or Stapleton. The club now had 370 members and was growing 
				apace with an exploding urban region, so naturally the intimate 
				civic contacts of the prewar days were being replaced by the 
				more complex communication of a metropolis. </p>
				<h3>Rotary in the 50s</h3>
				<p>As we come nearer the time when most club members have

					Aug. 1 - On Colorado Day, James Grafton Rogers, president of

					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="MsoNormal">First, that business leadership rather than

 w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> and <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Colorado</st1:place></st1:State>; </p>
				<p>Second, that survival as a great city and a great state is 
				dependent on continuous struggle to solve the many problems that 
				beset us, and that we face decline and decay if we lose the 
				vigor that comes from that struggle; </p>
				<p>Third, that our mountain barrier to the west is our 
				continuing major problem because Denver cannot continue as an 
				important city unless it reaches west as well as north, east and 
				south; and </p>
				<p>Fourth, we are shortsightedly spending more money on

				<h3>Rotary Turns 50</h3>
				<p>In 1961, our club's 50th year, there were 482 members 
				compared to the 60 of 1912, the first full year of its service 
				in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>. Paul Harris' international 
				organization had grown in that time from 49 clubs to 11,050, 
				with 511,500 members around the world. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				had 494,000 people, and the suburbs 435,000, almost a million 
				for the metro region! </p>
				<p>However, throughout all this change, the basic format of the <st1:PersonName
w:st="on">Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName> Club had remained in place. It 
				functioned for all its members as <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s leading luncheon club, 
				attracting the cream of the &quot;speaker&quot; crop. Roughly a third of 
				its meeting involved traditional Rotary matters, including the 
				RI focus on international affairs. </p>
				<p>As this decade opened, Club President Nick Petry reported on 
				the typical year of 1960-61. There had been 51 meetings with an 
				87.70 percent attendance record, enough to keep <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				in the &quot;Top Ten&quot; of the larger clubs around the world. Club 
				activities had become established in a fruitful pattern. Petry 
				noted the annual picnic at Elitch's, the two Christmas programs 
				and Ladies Night. Also, the International Service committee had 
				continued its efforts to produce good speakers on foreign 
				affairs, and an active student exchange program with clubs 
				overseas made <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName> 
				families consistent hosts to foreign students. </p>
				<p>The Inter-City Committee had arranged visits that year to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Cheyenne</st1:place></st1:City>, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Casper</st1:place></st1:City>, Brush, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Colorado Springs</st1:place></st1:City>, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Commerce</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Town</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
				and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Estes</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Park</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. The Orphan's Theatre Party had 
				continued its successful tradition, as had the Boys Work which 
				received $13,190 in special pledges from members. A special 
				committee had decided in this year to extend Rotary's efforts to 
				girls, the precursor of future relationships with Denver Girls 
				Inc. </p>
				<p>There were now 48 clubs in Rotary District 545, which club 
				member Ray Jenkins had just finished service as District 
				Governor. The district conference was held at the Broadmoor from 
				April 8-11, with 19 Denverites attending, and the international 
				convention in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Tokyo</st1:place></st1:City>. 
				Rotary International had accepted <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s invitation to hold the 1966 
				convention back in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Queen</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">City</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
				of the Plains. </p>
				<p>one of the memorable meetings of this Golden Jubilee Year was 
				the very first when Wes Towne, the club's executive secretary 
				since 1934, retired, having herded the club through a 
				Depression, three wars and innumerable growing pains. He said he 
				had served under 28 presidents, all of them &quot;great guys,&quot; and 
				that he was pleased that the job which had been given him on a 
				temporary basis had managed to last 27.5 years. </p>
				<p>A number of the speeches of this year introduced themes 
				familiar to present-day members. </p>

					in 1919-30 had spent $135,214, a significant total of 
					$239,651 on the two programs to date. Rotarians around the

					Foundation Fellowships for International Understanding, of 
					which the Denver Club has donated $6,381 to this major 
					activity of Rotary International. </li>

					Aug. 12 - Major General George Walker of the Army Corps of

					June 16 - Rotary International reports on the International 
					convention as follows: </li>
				</ul>
				<p>&quot;The 57th annual convention of Rotary International concluded 
				this afternoon in the sun-swept capital city of <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Colorado</st1:place></st1:State>, for 14,774 
				Rotarians, their families and guests from 67 countries. . . </p>
				<p>&quot;It was a legislative convention with 54 proposed enactments 
				and resolutions set before delegates representing 5,845 clubs. 
				Key proposals related to per-capital dues to Rotary 
				International . . . and provision for expenditure of up to $3.5 
				million dollars in a two-year period from the corpus of the 
				Rotary Foundation for expanded activities. . . </p>
				<p>&quot;To the state of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>'s City Auditorium, which was ringed 
				with flags of 133 nations, came distinguished speakers such as 
				U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s Lord Caradon and many 
				sparkling entertainers . . . to accommodate overflow crowds, 
				sessions on two occasions were carried by closed-circuit 
				telecast to an adjoining theatre. . . </p>
				<p>&quot;In a welcoming editorial, the Denver Post newspaper said 
				that '<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				is a somewhat more genteel city than when Paul Harris worked 
				here . . . but we guarantee that Rotarians and their ladies will 
				find there welcome as genuine as ever. We just don't shoot the 
				crystals off the chandeliers anymore when we get enthusiastic 
				over visitors.'&quot;</p>
				<p>A Red Rocks Theatre opening night performance under the stars 
				was a highlight, with Koshare Indian dancers, opera stars and 
				the 375-voice Mormon Tabernacle Choir in a two-hour performance 
				that ended with &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic.&quot; </p>
				<p>Dr. Lew Barbato, head of the Medical and Dental Service 
				Committee, later reported there was only one &quot;reaction to the 
				altitude - heart,&quot; a male. In all, Lew's staff treated 184 
				visitors for everything from a gnat in the eye to a broken 
				clavicle. </p>
				<p>Denver Club President Tom Tierney, in a letter of thanks to 
				all the Rotary Clubs in the suburbs area and in Districts 545 
				and 547 who had pitched in to help host the giant gathering, 
				said the most important benefit of the effort was &quot;a great new 
				realization that we are not just members of fine Rotary clubs. 
				But that our clubs are members of a far-flung international 
				organization that can and must play a significant role in world 
				understanding.&quot; For the remainder of 1966, the Denver Club was 
				receiving letters of thanks from around the world for its 
				massive hospitality. </p>
				<p>But in some ways this mid-1960s event so in accord with 
				Rotary's past traditions ran parallel with others that marked a 
				sea-change in eras. The <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				broncos appeared before the club, pushing for a new stadium as 
				national television became the major factor in American sports. 
				The city administration and the Denver Chamber urged a major 
				urban renewal project that was to change the face of Downtown. 
				The <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
				was sinking ever deeper into the war in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region> and bitter dissent was 
				breaking out on the campuses. And into <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				to fill the new office buildings came big energy people and 
				bigger energy finance. </p>
				<p>The <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				growth in the two decades after WWII had been largely contained 
				within the local ownership structures in place at the end of the 
				war. But after the mid-'60s, much of the hometown character of 
				Denver growth began to be shaped as much by external national 
				and world economics as by events within the state and region. By 
				the '70s, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				was a very different place. </p>
				<h3>Rotary In Our Times</h3>
				<p>Since roughly two-thirds of <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Denver 
				Rotary</st1:PersonName>
				members have joined since the 1966 International Convention, the 
				club history of our own times  the 70s and the 80s  need 
				less excavation. Yet if our days are not yet &quot;history&quot; in the 
				conventional sense, we need some perspective on them. For they 
				represent a club and a city of very different attitudes and 
				economics than in the early postwar era. Core city <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> had 494,000 citizens in 1960, the 
				suburbs almost as many, 435,000. But by 1970, the proportions 
				had shifted radically. Denver had grown to 515,000  four 
				percent over the decade  but the suburbs now numbered 713,000, 
				an increase of 64 percent in that time! </p>
				<p>From the middle 60s, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				and the club witnessed a number of somewhat contradictory events 
				which in retrospect can be seen as indicating a creeping 
				ambivalence on the &quot;growth&quot; issue. While the <st1:place w:st="on">
				Front Range</st1:place>
				megalopolis was &quot;exploding,&quot; more people were worried about the 
				effect of the blast on their lives. </p>
				<p>The Roberts Tunnel to bring in trans-mountain water was 
				opened in 1964 to sustain growth, while the Historic Denver and <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address
 w:st="on">Larimer Square</st1:address></st1:Street> movements to monitor its 
				quality through historic preservation began the next year. As 
				did Corky Gonzales' &quot;Crusade for Justice&quot; which signaled the 
				intention of <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> minorities to play 
				a fuller role in the civic establishment. </p>
				<p>William H. McNichols Jr. was elected mayor in 1968, another 
				strong multi-term mayor in the Speer and Stapleton tradition. 
				Yet despite supporting several bond issues to sustain growth, 
				such as those for the Auraria campus, the city transit system, 
				the Foothills water treatment plant, and to build Big Mac and 
				help with the DCPA, voters also turned down the Olympics in 72 
				and elected environmentalist Dick Lamm governor in 74. The 
				energy business brought 65,000 jobs to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				in the 70s, but the legislature passed the Poundstone Amendment 
				in 72, which froze the city's geographic boundaries. A <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Denver</st1:place></st1:City>
				of 59 square miles at Rotary's 30th birthday in 1941 and 118 by 
				its 60th in 1971, and that's where it's stayed, while the 
				suburbs boomed. </p>
				<p>To sense what was happening to Rotary and its city in our 
				times, we can turn to the Keyway at Rotary's 60th birthday in 
				1971, then to statehood's Centennial year of 1976, the 70th 
				birthday year of 1981, and finally to last year when the big 
				boom seemed to be busting. </p>

 			   Rotary</st1:PersonName> Club Foundation</h3>
				<p>The <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName> 
				Club Foundation was established as a tax-exempt entity in 1969, 
				but received little support until 1972 when Ed Kassler gave 
				$12,000 on condition members match it, which they did. By early 
				1977, the foundation had $32,000 and a committee was studying 
				its restructuring with the thought that growing demands on the 
				club were going to make essential a far more substantial &quot;kitty&quot; 
				for future service projects. </p>
				<p>On Easter <st1:date Year="1977" Day="10" Month="4" w:st="on">
				Sunday, April 10, 1977</st1:date>, the club lost its devoted 
				executive secretary, Dan Paxton, to a sudden heart attack. In 
				his memory the Foundation established the Dan Paxton Society as 
				a stimulus to member donation to the restructured Foundation. 
				Membership could be achieved by a donation of $1,000, a bequest 
				or a life insurance designation of $5,000, or a sustaining 
				pledge of $100 a year until the $1,000 per member goal was 
				achieved. (The Paxton Society was a success and had 118 members 
				by 1980.) </p>
				<p>The first board of the Foundation took office in May 1977 
				with William H. Hornby as president, and Junius Baxter, Ray 
				Jenkins, Rabbi Earl Stone, Roger L. Kinney, Robert S. McCollum, 
				Dr. Robert B. Sawyer, Kenneth W. Caughey, John R. Dickinson and 
				John C. Mitchell as trustees. By July of 1981, the Foundation 
				had assets of $183,696 but was still a long way from its 
				&quot;impossible dream&quot; of having $1,000,000 in assets by 1987. </p>
				<p>Then Former President and later District Governor Grant 
				Wilkins stepped in with his source of funding to give the Rotary 
				Club Foundation its permanent asset base. The show, thought 
				quite unlike anything <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName> 
				had tackled before, was spectacularly successful. By 1986, this 
				75th Anniversary year, the Foundation listed assets of 
				$1,250,000 plus, the large portion of it receipts from the art 
				show. </p>
				<p>But in 1981, many of the club could not imagine what was

				</ul>
				<p>To summarize the past few years of <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
				Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName>
				Club activity would be to extend this historical sketch beyond 
				its proper bounds. It is also impossible to name every 
				individual who has made a contribution to the club's record in 
				these 75 years, because every Rotarian has. </p>
				<p>None of these presidents [those serving since the club's 50th 
				birthday in 1961], be it know, could possibly have &quot;looked good&quot; 
				without the executive directors of the club who have managed its 
				increasingly complicated budgets and committees. They have 
				included G. Russell McAllister from May of 1927 to April of 
				1928; Carl A. Salstrand, from May 1928 to March 1930; and Carl 
				Almquist from April 1930 until January 1934. Then Wesley Towne, 
				who ruled from January 1934 until July 1961, and Dan C. Paxton, 
				from July 1961 until April 1977. Paxton was followed briefly by 
				Roger L. Kinney from May to October 1977, and by J. Stuart Moore 
				from October 1977 to date (1985). If the club has caliber, it's 
				because these men had and have it  that's the message of 
				numerous presidential valedictories over the years. </p>
				<p>One can gain an idea of where these men have brought the club 
				by analysis of budgets and rosters, keeping in mind the spartan 
				beginnings, wars, depressions, a deluge of population, and 
				shifts in attitudes toward community and service over the years.
				</p>
				<p>The Club budget for 1984-85 estimates revenues of $375,000 to 
				the operating fund. Expense items of more than $15,000 were for 
				meals, $132,500; salaries, $79,900; Keyway expense, $18,500; 
				rent, $17,700; and RI dues, $16,100. Committee work takes a 
				total of $38,700, with Ladies Night, the holiday parties for 
				children, the picnic and the New Member Night being the big 
				items. (This of course does not include monies spent separately 
				by Denver Boys, Denver Girls, the Scholarship Fund or the 
				Foundation.) </p>
				<p>At this point in time, the records indicate 36 committees 
				whose listing, while lengthy, best indicates the scope of club 
				service. </p>
				<p>They included, besides the Board of Directors and officers, 
				Artists of America, Athletic Sports, Attendance, Budget, Denver 
				Boys Inc., Denver Broncos Scholarship Fund, Denver Girls Inc., 
				Scholarship and Achievement Awards, Rotary Club Foundation, 75h 
				Anniversary Committee, District Conference, Family Holiday 
				Party, Fellowship, Group Study Exchange, Hotel Arrangements, 
				Inter-City Meetings, Invocations, Keyway, Ladies Night, 
				Long-Range Planning, Membership Extension, Music-Chorus, Picnic, 
				Program, Public Relations, Resolutions and Bylaws, Roster, 
				Rotary International Convention, Rotary International 
				Foundation, Rotary International, Special Meetings, Totem Pole 
				(new members), Vocational Service, World Community Service, 
				Youth Exchange, and Youth Mentor Program. </p>
				<p>By rough count, with inevitable duplications, about 500 
				Denver Rotarians are deeply involved in these activities, 
				engaging in &quot;service above self&quot; and in keeping track of their 
				community, nation, and world in their weekly meetings. With a 
				yearly operational budget of almost $400,000, a growing 
				Foundation with assets in excess of $1 million, a youth program 
				to which members separately contribute about $50,000 a year, and 
				various other charitable activities too numerous to mention, 
				Denver Rotarians have come a long way. They are entitled on 
				their 75th anniversary, to think that they have fulfilled those 
				far off dreams of 1911 when a handful of men, needing fellowship 
				and to serve their young city, thought that a new idea called 
				&quot;Rotary&quot; might help do something about it. </p>
				<p>Denver Rotarians must measure their accomplishments by the 
				goals the early members set, namely to encourage: </p>
				<ul type="disc">
					<li>
					The development of acquaintance as an opportunity for 
					service. </li>
					<li>
					High ethical standards in business and professions; the 
					recognition of the worthiness of all useful occupations; and 
					the dignifying by each Rotarian of his occupation as an 
					opportunity to serve society. </li>
					<li>
					The application of the ideal of service by every Rotarian to 
					his personal, business and community life. </li>
					<li>
					The advancement of international understanding, goodwill, 
					and peace through a world fellowship of business and 
					professional men united in the ideal of service. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>Only Rotarians themselves can decide if they've met those 
				tests well enough in the 75 years of close relationship between 
				a Club and a City. But for an institution to endure 75 years, to 
				grow significantly in membership and assets, to post an 
				unquestioned record of community service, and to do this while 
				maintaining essentially the same set of ideals and goals it 
				started out with, that's achievement! </p>
				<p>It merits celebration, and remembrance. </p>
				<h3>Statistics of Rotary (as of 1986)</h3>
				<p>Compiled by J. Stuart Moore. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">1. As of <st1:date Year="1986"
Day="1" Month="10" w:st="on">Oct. 1, 1986</st1:date>, there were 588 members of 
				the Rotary Club of Denver, including 312 Active, 247 Senior 
				Active, 26 additional Active, and three Past Service. Operations 
				budget for the club's 1986-87 year was $425,400. </p>
				<p>2. Denver Boys Inc. was established in 1946, and to date 1892 
				boys have participated in the program. Denver Rotarians have 
				contributed $619,657 and thousands of hours of volunteer time to

				time. </p>
				<p>4. Denver Rotarians have contributed $300,000 to the Rotary 
				International Foundation since its inception. There are 90 Paul 
				Harris Fellows and 105 Foundation sustaining members. </p>
				<p>5. The <st1:PersonName w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
  w:st="on">Denver</st1:place></st1:City> Rotary</st1:PersonName> Club 
				Foundation has a present net worth of $1,250,000. During its 
				seven years of operation to <st1:date Year="1986" Day="30" Month="6" w:st="on">
				June 30, 1986</st1:date>, it has made $320,207 in charitable 
				contributions. Also, the foundation has contributed $350,000 in 
				that time to the Colorado Historical Society in payment for its 
				services in co- producing and housing the annual Artists of 
				America Show. </p>
				<p>6. Many high school students from this country and abroad 
				have participated in the Youth Exchange program, being hosted in 
				Rotarian homes during the year's education. </p>
				<p>7. Through its World Community Service Committee, <st1:PersonName
w:st="on">Denver Rotary</st1:PersonName> has assisted various projects 
				worldwide, which needed such things as medical supplies, 
				generating equipment, sanitation programs, and personal training 
				and equipment.</p>
				<h3>Object of Rotary</h3>
				<p>The object of Rotary is to encourage and foster the ideal of 
				service as a basis of worthy enterprise and, in particular, to 
				encourage and foster: </p>
				<p>First. The development of acquaintance as an opportunity for 
				service; </p>
				<p>Second. High ethical standards in business and professions; 
				the recognition of the worthiness of all useful occupations; and 
				the dignifying by each Rotarian of his occupation as an 
				opportunity to serve society; </p>
				<p>Third. The application of the ideal of service by every 
				Rotarian to his personal, business and community life; </p>
				<p>Fourth. The advancement of international understanding, good 
				will, and peace through a world fellowship of business and 
				professional men united in the ideal of service. </p>
				<h3>A Philosophy</h3>
				<p>&quot;Fundamentally, Rotary is a philosophy of life that 
				undertakes to reconcile the ever present conflict between the 
				desire to profit for one's self and the duty and consequent 
				impulse to serve others. This philosophy is the philosophy of 
				Service -- &quot;Service above Self&quot;-- and is based on the practical 
				ethical principle that &quot;He profits most who serves best.&quot; </p>
				<p>&quot;Primarily, a Rotary Club is a group of representative 
				business and professional men who . . . have accepted the Rotary 
				philosophy of service and are seeking: First, to study 
				collectively the theory of service as the true basis of success 
				and happiness in business and in life; and second, to give, 
				collectively, practical demonstrations of it to themselves and 
				their community; and third, each as an individual, to translate 
				its theory into practice in his business and in his everyday 
				life; and fourth, individually and collectively by active 
				precept and example, to stimulate its acceptance both in theory 
				and practice by all non-Rotarians as well as by all Rotarians.&quot;
				</p>
				<p>The above quotation is an excerpt from Resolution No. 34 
				which was adopted by the clubs at the 1923 Convention and 
				slightly amended at subsequent conventions. </p>
