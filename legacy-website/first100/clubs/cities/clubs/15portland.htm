		<td valign="top" class="auto-style25"  width: 1050px;>In 1905, Paul 
		Harris of Chicago gathered a group of representative business and 
		professional men in friendship and fellowship to form the first Rotary 
		Club. That same year, the Lewis and Clark Centennial World’s Fair and 
		Exposition, a world-class event, was held in Portland, Oregon in 
		celebration of the 100 year-old trek west of those two pioneers. Among 
		the visitors was Phillip Grossmayer, a young insurance executive and a 
		resident of Leadville, Colorado, who liked what he saw in Portland. Phil 
		went back to Colorado to sell his insurance agency, and in 1906 moved to 
		the Rose City to start a new insurance business. He didn’t know a soul 
		in Portland.<br><br>
		<img alt="Wheel (click to enlarge)" class="auto-style27" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/cities/clubs/15portland/1916_Original_Spokes_small.jpg" style="float: left">Phil 
		learned about Rotary from some of his business associates, and the idea 
		of inter-friendship, fellowship, and reciprocity appealed to him. He 
		remembered his “stranger’s start” when he arrived in Portland only a few 
		years previously. The idea of Rotary was gaining ground. Fourteen clubs 
		had been formed by 1910, including those in Los Angeles, Tacoma, and 
		Seattle. The Seattle Club agreed to sponsor Portland, which was offered 
		the opportunity to organize the fifteenth club if they moved quickly.<br>
		<br>On May 10, 1910, six men, including Phil Grossmayer, met at Phil’s 
		office in the Board of Trade Building and agreed to approach others they 
		believed would serve as congenial members. Fifteen days later, on May 
		25, 1910, the Rotary Club of Portland was organized with 20 charter 
		members. Dwight Edwards was elected as President, Louise A. Colton as 
		Vice President, H.V. Carrington as Secretary, and J.T. O’Neill became 
		Sergeant at Arms.<br><br>

		(click to enlarge)The fledgling club didn’t waste any time getting 
		started. However, they quickly learned that at their special evening 
		meeting on June 8, 1910, Rotary Clubs from Tacoma and Seattle, 
		Washington would come to Portland with a delegation, some bringing their 
		wives, arriving 184 strong by a reserved Oregon-Washington railroad 
		train. After regaining their composure, about eight Portland Rotarians 
		dug up enough money for a brass band to meet them at the depot. This 
		contingency then marched through the streets, and “the Portland Club was 
		organized with a vengeance.” The local newspaper, The Oregonian, 
		reported in its June 9, 1910 edition: “Rotary Club Organized…members of 
		three such organizations at banquet.” The story identified the attendees 
		as “super boosters.”<br><br>Excitement soared as this young club quickly 
		learned it would host the next national convention of the National 
		Association of Rotary Clubs of America. A shortage of funds to finance 
		the event did not deter Phil Grossmayer, who borrowed $2,000 from fellow 
		charter member J.L. Wright to cover costs. The 1911 National Convention 
		of 149 Rotarians and guests turned out to be more than just a routine 
		gathering of delegates from all over the United States. This was to be 
		the first manifestation of the idea that Rotary could and should be more 
		than a person-to-person or company-to-company business building 
		assemblage. Perhaps it was the beauty and expanse of the Oregon country 
		as viewed from the Columbia River cruise ship that was a highlight 
		convention event. It was at this convention that the stated objectives 
		of Rotary changed from: “To advance the business interest of the 
		individual members” to “He profits most who serves best.” The resolution 
		making this major shift in Rotary emphasis was given birth in Portland, 
		and following a spirited debate, passed by acclamation. The Rotary Club 
		of Portland was proud to be part of this momentous occasion.<br><br>In 
		1920, the event of the year for the Rotary Club of Portland was the 
		election of one of its members, Estes (Pete) Snedecor, to the presidency 
		of Rotary International. Only 32, Pete presided at the first 
		International Convention to be held outside the North American 
		Continent, in the beautiful city of Edinburgh, Scotland. During Pete’s 
		presidency, emphasis was placed on worldwide peace and understanding as 
		part of Rotary’s mission. Even though Pete had only one leg (a boyhood 
		accident resulted in the loss), it was never a handicap, and he climbed 
		mountains (Mt. Hood twice), and played golf and tennis regularly.<br>
		<br>The Rotary Club of Portland hosted Rotary International’s convention 
		again in 1990 for its 81st convention, with 21,300 Rotarians and guests 
		in attendance. At that time, it was the largest convention ever held in 
		Portland and the second largest Rotary convention in the United States. 
		Rotary International realized nearly $1 million in profit, and the local 
		economy benefited by more than $25 million.<br><br>Historically, the 
		Rotary Club of Portland has a “mystery” tradition not yet identified. A 
		“banker’s whistle” is a greeting reserved for bankers and other high 
		finance people, delivered as a two-tone whistle salute not unlike the 
		“wolf call” whistle. In this exclusive Portland Rotary instance it’s 
		given when the person is introduced at the weekly luncheon. Research a 
		number of years ago among old timers produced nothing as to how and 
		where this tradition began. “Gee, I don’t know,” responded one long-time 
		member. “Didn’t we always do it?”<br><br>During its first 95 years, the 
		Rotary Club of Portland evolved into a major contributor to the 
		community’s well being and a strong supporter of Rotary International’s 
		world-wide efforts. The club continues to assist the community through a 
		multitude of programs, which includes providing electrically powered 
		wheelchairs to needy, handicapped individuals through its Wheels of 
		Power program, now in its 27th year. To date, more than $5.3 million 
		dollars has been received and paid out in capital grants to qualifying 
		community organizations. <br><br>Its program to help “at risk” middle 
		school students through youth mentoring and scholarship is in its 13th 
		operational year. Each year, the Rotary Club of Portland provides the 
		opportunity for 100 high school juniors and seniors to explore the 
		challenges and opportunities of our free enterprise system through a 
		three-day retreat and seminar, which allows each student to interact 
		with successful business people and participate in a team project. 
		Acting as a leader with other District 5100 clubs, the Rotary Club of 
		Portland raised $11 million to create a world-class Children’s Museum 
		facility, designed for handicapped children and adults. <br><br>The 
		Museum adjoins the Portland Rose Garden Children’s Park in Washington 
		Park and was funded by $2 million raised by Portland Rotary. Rotarians 
		of this club partner with other Rotary clubs to help bring clean water 
		to Central American villages, provide funds for scholarship assistance, 
		construct a wheelchair manufacturing site in Guatemala, and start 
		microbanks in local Central American villages. The Rotary Club of 
		Portland’s Centennial Project is the rebuilding of its “Rotary Village” 
		at YMCA Camp Collins, originally built in 1956. This $1.5 million 
		project includes six unique “hobbit” cabins, each complete with plants 
		on the roof, round doors only five feet tall, a small bathroom, and a 
		porch.<br><br>
