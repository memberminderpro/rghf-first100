				Thomas Jefferson Davis 1888 - 1953
                Tom J. Davis was born in Weir City, Kansas, in 1888, and came to Butte, Montana, as a boy with his parents in 1897. He attended the Butte Business College and later entered 
                the University of Michigan Law School where he graduated with honors.

				<br><br>1924 he was elected Director and Third Vice-President at RI. at the Toronto Convention, and served on Board Committees along with his other Board duties. 
				He later served as member and Chairman at many RI. committees until 
				he was called become President of Rotary International in 1941-42. Tom was a member of the International Executive Committee of the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park.
                Aside from his Rotary activities, Tom Davis held many offices and memberships in community, state and national organizations. 
				<br><br>He was a member at the executive committee of the Montana State School of Mines; Member of the Board at

						  		That Butte Rotary even got started is a tribute to the stout hearted!
								Like the history of the city itself, the history of the Butte Rotary club was, and is, unique, rough 'n tumble, individualistic, and fun loving. 
								It's a tribute to the stout hearted that the organization ever got started in the first place considering its stormy beginning. 
						  <br><br>Former Butte Rotary Club president Bob Fletcher, one wrote, "In 1913 the Irish Free 
						  		State and northern Ireland organized Rotary clubs.
						  		Whether this influenced Butte or not is debatable, but organization work began April 16, 1914, with the Spokane club acting as sponsor."
								The idea of Rotary Club in Butte began peacefully enough” and application for charter was made May 9, 1914 with 25 members enrolled. 
						  <br><br>Then the fireworks began!
								An anonymous disgruntled "Butte Businessman" wrote a letter to The Anaconda Standard alleging that the members of this new organization 
								had bound themselves to the unethical stifling of competition in the lines of business they represented. 
								The writer professed familiarity with what he designated as the "inner workings' of such nefarious clubs. 
						  <br><br>The tirade went on at length, and the newspaper published it.<br><br>
						  	  <img border="0" height="159" src="http://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/rips/13-14greiner.jpg" width="106" class="auto-style17" style="float: left">
						  	  Of course this caused quite a stir, and some of the original group of 37 interested Butte men backed off. Personal and professional integrity 
								was involved. It was deemed that a Charter dated May 7, 1914 was received, although no such Charter was ever found. 
						  <br><br>Correspondence in that period from International President Russell F. Greiner and one of Rotary's all-time 
								wheel-horses. Mr. Chesley R. Perry, (left) Secretary of Rotary International, encouraged the Butte club to carry on and to ignore the abuse.
						  <br><br>Excepts from one of the letters sent to the Butte Rotary club on May 21, 1914 by RI President Greiner, said: 
								<img align="left" border="0" height="155" src="http://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/clubs-of-rips/butte/1914-03pic_small.gif" 
								width="105" xthumbnail-orig-image="http://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/clubs-of-rips/butte/1914-03pic.gif">
								"I am in receipt of newspaper clippings published in the Standard of your city, April 20th, 1914, attacking Rotary, 
								and signed 'Butte Business Man'. Words are inadequate for me to express my contempt for a coward who will write an anonymous
								communication. He is the guerilla of business life, the hissing serpent of society. 
						  </td>
						  <td class="auto-style19" valign="top" width="50%">
								No one can safeguard themselves against his attacks, and only his kith and kin will subscribe to his statements." 
In any event, thus encouraged, the remaining group of 25 men who did become charter members, carried through and 
the club's official charter carries the date, "February 1, 1915." 
<br><br>The delay was the result of investigation by RI authorities to make certain the Butte aspirants for recognition 
hadn't misrepresented the ideals of Rotary by setting up some sort of monopolistic merry-go-round or cartel in 
restraint of local trade. <br><br>It was a pretty serious matter at the time.
Butte Rotary No. 140 thereby became Montana's first. Since then it has been privileged to sponsor clubs in Deer Lodge, Helena, Twin Bridges, 
Whitehall, Dillon, Philipsburg and White Sulphur Springs.

Thomas Jefferson Davis, Butte lawyer and civic leader whom Everett W. Hill called, a great man, a great friend, a great humanitarian, a great 
Rotarian who symbolized Rotary in every respect, " became a member of Rotary in 1915. was elected president of the Butte Rotary club in 1920, 
and District Governor of the 20th District (Montana, Idaho and Utah) in 1921. In 1926 he was one of two candidates for the Presidency of 
Rotary International but was defeated by Harry H. Rogers (left) of San Antonio, TX.
								<br><br>This defeat did not lessen Tom's interest in Rotary nor his service to the organization. He soon was on the International Board and became 
chairman of several important committees. By 1941 he was the unanimous choice for the President of Rotary International, and served in that 
office during the Rotary year 1941-42.
<br><br>These were the early years of World War II and were a critical time in RI history. It's certain that without the cool-headed guidance of 
Tom Davis, his officers and board, Rotary International could easily have been split asunder by the nationalistic forces and pressures of the day. 
								<br><br>Not even Paul Harris, who was a clear friend of Tom's, has had a greater influence for good on Rotary International. 
Torn Davis' untimely death in 1953 ended a brilliant career.
