		Home Page</a><br><br>The Rotary Club of Nambour, the first Rotary club 
		established on the Sunshine Coast, has a long history of service to the 
		community and involvement with many of the international service 
		programs of Rotary International. Through the active membership of 
		dedicated Rotarians the Club has continued to respond to opportunities 
		locally as well as internationally. <br><br>Major projects, undertaken 
		in Community Service and International Service during the past 
		twenty-five years, are described below.<br><br>During the 1979-80 year 
		Past RI President Clem Renouf put forward the idea of a welfare project 
		for the Nambour area. After consideration, the Rotary Club of Nambour 
		and the Rotary Club of Nambour 76 decided that it should be an aged 
		persons village similar to Sundale Garden Village previously established 
		by the Apex Club of Nambour.<br>This was designated as a Rotary 75th 
		Anniversary project, and the two clubs, with a gift from Clem, raised 
		$80 000 to get the project underway. Subsequently, the activities of 
		Rotary Garden Village and Sundale Garden Village were merged, and four 
		Rotarians now serve on the Board. This organisation is one of the 
		largest not-for-profit community groups on the Sunshine Coast, and there 
		are over 800 residents in the various facilities, 150 of whom are in 
		Rotary Garden Village.<br><br>The first Rotary food stall was conducted 
		at the Nambour Show in the 1977-78 Rotary year when the Club, operating 
		out of a tin shed, raised $1450. Over the years operating facilities 
		have been improved, and by 1996 a modern food stall was in operation. 
		Revenue from this activity, averaging in excess of $25 000 per year over 
		the past few years, is a major contributor to the Club’s fundraising.<br>
		<br>During 1985 the Club undertook the construction of new Red Cross 
		Rest Rooms in the grounds of the Nambour Hospital. For those people with 
		next-of-kin dangerously ill in hospital these comfortable amenities 
		provide urgently needed accommodation.<br><br>In 1992 the Club, together 
		with the Maroochy Shire Council and Meals on Wheels, undertook the task 
		of extending the Meals on Wheels building, contributing $30 000, plus 
		volunteer labour towards the project. The Club had contributed towards 
		the funding of the original building and provided a minibus to assist 
		with the delivery of meals.<br><br>Following the establishment of the 
		University of the Sunshine Coast, the Club initiated talks with the 
		Vice-Chancellor about the most appropriate way Rotary could assist with 
		the development of this facility, and enhance its links with the 
		community. From these discussions the Community Fund was established 
		embracing all Rotary clubs on the Sunshine Coast. After initially 
		providing substantial funds to assist in research projects, the Fund now 
		concentrates on providing annual scholarships to encourage postgraduate 
		studies in the various faculties. <br><br>In 2001 one of the most 
		ambitious projects ever undertaken by the Club was initiated. Hear and 
		Say, a Queensland-based community organization operating centres 
		throughout the State for children who are deaf or hearing impaired, saw 
		the need for a centre on the Sunshine Coast. The Club accepted the task 
		of underwriting the project through the purchase of land and final 
		construction of suitable premises.<br><br>Thanks to the tremendous work 
		of Club members and the support of local businesses, workers, charitable 
		trusts, the general public and other Rotary clubs on the Sunshine Coast, 
		the project was completed in 2004. Hear and Say now has a magnificent 
		purpose-built centre providing a full service for children on the 
		Sunshine Coast. <br><br>Hear and Say has a facility with a valuation in 
		excess of $0.75m and members of the Club are still directly involved in 
		the ongoing support of the organisation.<br><br>During the past 
		twenty-five years Rotary has moved to embrace the international aspects 
		of service and it is fitting that the Rotary Club of Nambour should have 
		been so heavily involved in international activities. While our own Clem 
		Renouf was R.I. President, the 3H program and The 75th Anniversary Fund 
		for the 3H Program were established. In Nambour this new direction from 
		Rotary International was supported enthusiastically. Following are some 
		highlights of the Club’s activities. <br><br>Nambour was the first club 
		worldwide to contribute to the 3H Program, and after initially 
		contributing more than $80 000 to the original PolioPlus, fundraising 
		has continued to support this through the PolioPlus Partner program.<br>
		<br>In the past twenty-five years contributions to The Rotary Foundation 
		have allowed the Club to recognise in excess of forty Paul Harris 
		Fellows.<br><br>Members have participated in at least six FAIM projects 
		to Papua New Guinea and the Philippines.<br><br>Matching Grants have 
		been provided for projects in various developing areas.<br><br>Youth 
		Exchange, Group Study Exchange, and Ambassadorial Scholarship Programs 
		have been fully supported.<br><br>In addition to the Club’s achievements 
		in Community and International Service, mention must be made of the 
		inclusion in its ranks of female members, the hosting of two District 
		Conferences, and the continued fellowship enjoyed by members over so 
		many years. These, too, are among the highlights of the Rotary Club of 
		Nambour.<br><br>attributed to Alan Hocking<br><br>And then of course, 
		our greatest honour - maybe it was a partial recognition of the Club's 
		greatness, its spawning ground for some of the best Rotarians. Maybe it 
		was just recognition that one our past presidents was so active, so 
		dedicated, such a good leader that Past President Clem Renouf was 
		elected Rotary International President for the year 1978/79.<br><br>
		Clem's full biography can be read in his book, but a short precis 
		follows -<br><br>He was a Charter Member of the Rotary Club of Nambour 
		in 1949.<br>Clem was president of the Rotary Club of Nambour, 1954/55.<br>
		Clem was District Governor 1965/66<br>Director of Rotary International 
		1970/72<br>Finally, RI President, 1978/79<br><br>acknowledgements to the
