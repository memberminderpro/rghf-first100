		<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Beginnings</span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In October of 1978 a group of business and 
		professional men began meeting on Fridays at </span></font>noon at the 
		Red Lion Inn in Blacksburg for the purpose of forming a Rotary Club. 
		These men were residents of Blacksburg and Christiansburg and the 
		surrounding areas. Some were members of the Rotary Club of 
		Christiansburg-Blacksburg and some were prospective members of the 
		proposed new club. The meetings were held with the support and 
		sponsorship of the Christiansburg-Blacksburg Club.</p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The discussion and planning for these 
		meetings at the Red Lion Inn had begun almost a year earlier and were 
		triggered by at least two important factors. The size of the Evening 
		Club was outgrowing the available facilities for meetings and there was 
		a belief that a club meeting during the lunch hour would attract many 
		good potential Rotarians for whom an evening meeting was inappropriate.</span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">There was some disagreement, initially, in 
		the Evening Club, but, after full discussion, the club concluded that 
		the most desirable decision for the community and for Rotary 
		International would be to sponsor a new club and this was the action 
		taken. The late Andy Reynolds served as the liaison member from the 
		sponsor club to the proposed club. Andys leadership, recruiting and 
		planning were vital to the beginnings of the new club. The club 
		historian is in possession of a videotape in which the founders discuss 
		the birth of our club.</span></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Under the leadership of its Charter 
		President and his immediate successor the club began almost at once to 
		experience a healthy growth and to make its mark among the clubs of 
		District 7570.<br>
&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"></p>
		<p align="center"><strong>We Remember the Charter Members</strong></span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Under the sponsorship of the Evening Club, 
		a charter was granted to the new group by Rotary International on </span>
		</font>January 25, 1979. Charter night was held on February 15, 1979 at 
		the Continuing Education center on the Virginia Tech campus. The club 
		had 51 initial members and its official name was the Rotary Club of 
		Blacksburg-Christiansburg Noon. The first officers and board of 
		directors were Bane Atkinson, President; Bob Sullins, Vice President; 
		Ken Martin, Secretary; Gordon Winbery, Treasurer; and Lew Shelor, 
		Sergeant at Arms.</p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">

		listed in its first bulletin were:</span></font></p>

		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">* These members marked with an asterisk

		<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">A Decade Later</span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Ten Years after being chartered, two 
		significant events took place. In 1988 the club voted to accept women 
		into full membership and In February of 1988, Joyce Hoerner was elected 
		as the first woman member of the club. Many women have accepted 
		membership since then. Also, just a decade after the birth of the club, 
		the club officially changed its name to the Rotary Club of Blacksburg.</span></font></p>
		<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">
		<font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Community Support</span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The earliest community support project 
		aided by the club acting as an organization may have been the YMCA 
		Garden Project for senior citizens. The seniors have small garden plots 
		for themselves in various locations, which are seeded and worked by 
		other people except for those who want to do this themselves. The club 
		began early putting $300.00 each year into this program. </span></font>
		</p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Two other programs, which began early in 
		the clubs existence, were the Christmas Store and the Clubs Fine Arts 
		Awards to high school students. The Christmas Store, which had its start 
		in </span></font>Montgomery County in 1982, received significant support 
		from the club and its members from its very beginning. One Noon 
		member, Dan Guin, played a substantial role in its origin and 
		development. Today the Christmas store is continuing to thrive and grow. 
		They served over 1,400 families during recent holiday seasons.</p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Fine Arts Awards are a purely </span></font>noon 
		phenomenon and are due largely to two members, Dan Schneck, with his 
		spouse, Judi, and to Dave Widder. Recognition and cash awards are given 
		each year to the outstanding high school students in the Visual Arts, 
		Instrumental and Vocal Music, and Dramatic Arts. The awards are now 
		recognized as playing an important part in improvement in these studies 
		in the countys schools. Also in the high school award area the club 
		recognizes an Outstanding Senior from each county high school each year 
		and has these students speak to the club as part of a program. A 
		worthwhile side effect of this activity is having club members see and 
		hear some very promising future citizens. </p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In the past the club had a program of 
		cooperation with high school guidance departments through which a 
		Vocational Service Directory was available to each school and in which 
		some 65 club members volunteered to share vocational experience / 
		expertise in career development activities with students and faculty.
		</span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">For many years the Excellence in 
		Vocational Education has been awarded annually by our club. Several $500 
		vocational scholarships are given to high school students for the 
		college of their choice. Another award, the Stuart Beville Memorial 
		Rotary Scholarship Fund at the </span></font>New River Community College 
		started in 1994. Each year $1,000 is awarded to a qualifying student. 
		Stuart was a member of this club and the club has funded the entire 
		scholarship. Our club gives support also to the Montgomery County 4-H 
		Clubs.</p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The University Office of International 
		Programs at Virginia Tech has established a scholarship fund for Tech 
		students wishing to participate in study abroad programs. Our 
		participation in this project will be one of our most recent 
		contributions to the community.</span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Four-Way Test /Vocation Service Award 
		is presented each year to a citizen of the Montgomery County area who 
		through his or here business practices, character, and lifestyle, best 
		exemplifies Rotary Internationals Four-Way Test. The award has now 
		become the Citizen of the Year Award. 1998s award recipient was Ben 
		Crawford, a full time volunteer, Boy Scout, 4-H member, beekeeper, and 
		leader in our community.</span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">This list alone would be considered worthy 
		by any club. But we are not done yet. Planning for the </span></font>
		Talbot Memorial Park on the Huckleberry Trail is now almost complete. It 
		will be a fitting tribute to a past president that served our club well. 
		Broomin and Bloomin, an event held citywide has become an annual event 
		for our group with cooperation from so many of us. The Prices Fork/Route 
		460 By-Pass Exchange Cleanup has been conducted since 1991 with many of 
		us taking part several time a year.</p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">As the years have gone 
		by, other support activities have been added as needs have appeared and 
		interest developed. Sponsorship of the Bloodmobile visits several times 
		each year; sponsoring high school students attendance at Rotary Youth 
		Foundation Leadership Conferences are some of these activities. The 
		clubs financial needs for these activities are supported by such things 
		as its yard sale in early autumn, the aluminum-recycling project, as 
		well as by individual giving where necessary.</span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Our clubs history would not be complete 
		without mentioning our involvement in sponsoring other clubs. In 1985 
		the Blacksburg Rotary Club joined with the Christiansburg-Blacksburg 
		Rotary Club in sponsoring the new Rotary Club of Montgomery County which 
		meets as a breakfast club. Our sponsorship of the Giles County Rotary 
		Club came in 1997 and Don Clements agreed to take on the leadership 
		role.</span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Our former President, Dick Talbot, in 1993 
		said it best and it is our truth still today. Our primary objective 
		will be to focus on local community service. Our strategy for this is to 
		provide as many </span></font>noon programs as possible on community 
		issues and to design one project aimed at better communication and more 
		community pride.</p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We no longer participate in all of the 
		above mentioned programs. The truth is that some programs have worked 
		and some have not. But our club continues to blaze new trails in 
		community service, searching for ways we can best serve those in our 
		society. We constantly keep watch for those in need of support or 
		recognition, with the further intention of grooming our future leaders. 
		We know our community needs any help, our help, and our service. </span>
		</font></p>
		<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">
		<font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Support for Rotary 
		International</span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Our clubs support for Rotary 
		International can be summed up in two words: The Foundation. This does 
		not mean that there has been nothing else because there have been many 
		other things. A number of activities to which the club has regularly 
		lent it aid are: District Conferences, District meetings for a variety 
		of purposes wherever they may have been held, and report submissions in 
		full and on time which takes the unsung but dedicated time and energy of 
		hard-working members. The club has given freely of its money and time 
		from members to District Programs like Reach Out to </span></font>
		Haiti. We contributed to the project for creating wells in Bangladesh 
		in 1997. The Polio Plus campaign was another successful campaign for 
		us with our specific target being Nigeria in 1998.</p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Project R.E.A.D. SA (Rotary Educational 
		Aid Donation South Africa) was initiated to provide needed educational 
		books to the public schools in Rotary District 9320 </span></font>South 
		Africa. We as caring Rotarians have a dream that all children of the 
		world should have an adequate educational experience to enable them to 
		have useful, productive, and happy lives. In striving to achieve this 
		dream we responded by collecting textbooks. In 1998 we shipped 140 
		sizable cartons of books to South Africa. </p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The club has from its very beginning and 
		under the dedicated leadership of its First President, Bane Atkinson, 
		led the district in club-wide giving to the Foundation and in proportion 
		of its members who are Paul Harris Fellows. The membership has come to 
		believe strongly in the programs of the Foundation. In 1982 it began its 
		Foundation Month Raffle for raising money. This tradition continues 
		today with success proven by the consistently increasing giving of its 
		members. </span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">As the club is ending its 25<sup>th</sup> 
		year of existence it can count 190 names of members, other family 
		members or friends who have been named Paul Harris Fellows. This club is 
		a leader in District 7570. This record of support demonstrates the 
		clubs commitment to Rotary International and the worthy causes they 
		have selected. </span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Rotary International updates our club 
		monthly on projects worthy of our attention and efforts. One of the 
		latest announcements involves youth programs and matching funds with 
		Rotary International to offer up support. It is only natural that Rotary 
		would look for ways to start with our young people of the world. To 
		develop a sense of concern and caring in their hearts would mean 
		insuring a future of service for the world.</span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The club has sponsored students and young 
		adults to go to many different nations. The members have regularly 
		received, thoroughly enjoyed and learned, too, from exchange visitors 
		from such diverse places, as </span></font>England, Holland, Sweden, 
		South Africa, and Australia. In the fall of 1994 we had student visitors 
		from Tamworth, Australia, Amy Louise McLean, Sarah Louise Bissett, and 
		Kelly-Anne Tait. We sent three students, Nathan Kyle, Elizabeth Newcomb, 
		and Matt Belay there in exchange during the summer of 1995. Then again 
		from Australia during the fall of 1995 we had Robyn Byrnes, Kate 
		Lollback, and Hayley Whitten. And we last sent during the summer of 1996 
		John Davis, Corinne Brown, and Brent Powell. The club then had the 
		opportunity to learn from each of these delightful young people. This 
		has been repeated many times because the members believe in the abundant 
		educational exchange created by the experience.</p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">This focus on Rotary Internationals 
		Exchange Programs with Americans visiting other countries and other 
		nationals coming here has given the membership a motivation they might 
		not otherwise have had. It allows our club to bring even more new and 
		innovative ways to benefit our community while keeping ever mindful of 
		Rotary Internationals motto - Service Above Self.</span></font></p>

		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">All of us enjoy the visits with the

		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">

		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Our clubs own members have given us 
		excellent programs to remember. Buzz Shaw and his demonstration on 
		Virtual Reality was a chance to show our club the newest and latest in 
		computer technology and engineering. Tamara Stinson discussed with us 
		what </span></font><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">being a Junior 
		Achievement volunteer is all about. Terri Walkers program featured a 
		puppet show and told us about the Summer Reading Program.</span></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">We held a reverse raffle to raise money 
		for the PolioPlus Program. We raffled off a new car that we bought from 
		Holiday Ford for the dealers price. That year we raised over $26,000 
		for the program. Actually the raffle programs were so popular we started 
		holding them twice a year. In the spring money raised at the raffle goes 
		toward the benefit of community programs. Our fall raffle always 
		benefits a project sponsored by Rotary International. </span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">All our awards programs were notable. Dan 
		Schneck came up with the idea of the Fine arts Awards for our high 
		school students for music, painting, and drama. Achievements in 
		academics and sports receive wide recognition but little attention was 
		ever given to those students who excelled in the Arts. So our club 
		decided to do something about that. Carl McDaniels came up with the idea 
		of the Vocational Awards. And the Stuart Beville Scholarship Award was 
		established at the </span></font>New River Community College to honor a 
		former member. Half the fun from these awards is the opportunity to 
		listen to what they have meant to the recipients. </p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Sponsorship of the Breakfast Club and the 
		Giles County Club were notable programs, too. We recognized the need to 
		share Rotary and saw an opportunity to expand its influence in the 
		community by starting two new clubs.</span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Exchange visitors always entertain us 
		Russia, Korea, Australia and more.</span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The club continues to grow and benefit in 
		its view of young people and the world. Hearing its youth report their 
		trips abroad on Rotary Exchanges contribute to our wealth of knowledge 
		and stimulate our desire to provide service.</span></font></p>

		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">No matter who the speaker, no matter what 
		the topic, each member present can honestly say that some point of 
		relevance was revealed that day. More than that, you can always count on 
		one thing. If you visit our club you will hear voices raised in unison 
		to welcome each and every person. Saying Hi! really makes visitors and 
		guests feel warmly welcomed. Dan Schneck started the tradition of saying 
		Hi, (Name) to our visitors and guests. The welcome that we have 
		extended to speakers and visitors has always been and will continue to 
		be a spirited one.</span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">It seems that the Rowdy Table (what a 
		tradition) started just about the time that Page Warner joined the club. 
		Every guest speaker is dually warned prior to their engagement that we 
		harbor a table of critics. Constructive <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">
		criticism</span> is the term we like to use to describe what this group 
		brings to the club. But you must arrive early to secure a seat in this 
		coveted section.</span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Sometime during the presidency of Dick 
		Bohlin or Dave Reemsnyder the tradition of gift giving started. 
		Specifically, a Rotary Cup was presented to guest lecturers. That gave 
		way to giving the Jefferson Cup. And this led to the present day 
		practice until 2004 when began giving brick pavers, in the name of our 
		speakers, that will be put in the walkway along Wong Park--- Blacksburg 
		Rotarys Centennial project. We offer this token of appreciation to each 
		speaker for having shared with us. </span></font></p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In 1987 under the leadership of President 
		Jim Moore and his Board the club voted to accept ladies into full 
		membership. Federal Courts had mandated that Civic clubs could no longer 
		exclude females and Rotary did not choose to contest the decision. In 
		February 1988 Joyce Hoerner was voted into full membership as the first 
		female of this club and several others have since joined. </span></font>
		Mary Miller became our first woman president in 2002.</p>
		<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" color="black" size="2">
		<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In 1991 Rotary International changed our 
		designation from District 757 to 7570. They did so to accommodate the 
		ever-increasing number of clubs. Surely this speaks well of Rotary in 
		general. Our membership count now stands at 125 give or take a few. This 
		is a pretty outstanding number for a lunch club. Meeting attendance 
		goals are always an issue. But we are doing great. We can boast of a 
		level of 81 to 82%, which for our District is very good.</span></font></font></b></td>
