		Rotary Clubs have hosted six international conventions. The 15th annual 
		convention and the second convened outside the United States was held in 
		Toronto - 		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/conventions/1924/index.htm">
		an Ojibwa word meaning &quot;Place of Meeting&quot;</a> - on 16-20 June 1924. A 
		total 9,187 registrants, representing 31 countries, and 1,543 of the 
		1,704 clubs in the Rotary world , made this Rotary International 
		Convention the largest to date. Participants came from as far away as 
		South Africa, Australia, China and Japan.<br><br>(Photo &quot;1924 Convention 
		in Session at the coliseum, Canadian National exhibition&quot;)<br><br>
		Delegates and visitors arrived by automobile, train and boat. There were 
		several special district trains and chartered boats, some of which were 
		used as living quarters during convention week. Those who came by train 
		were met at the station by a reception committee wearing blue coats, 
		white flannels, polkadot ties, and blue and gold-banded hats. One 
		observer noted that after a swift fraternal greeting the delegates were 
		lined up and marched off briskly to the shrill sweetness of a pipe band 
		to the King Edward Hotel, the premier convention hotel. Similar scenes 
		were seen at the wharves as various boats came gently alongside with 
		their loads of Rotarians and guests.<br><br>International conventions of 
		any kind were novelties in most cities in 1924. <br><br>Toronto reacted 
		to the occasion by proving itself to be truly a &quot;place of meeting.&quot; The 
		welcome and hospitality left nothing to be desired. The city was 
		beautifully decorated, and the route to the convention centre was 
		decorated by Toronto City Council with flags of the nations represented 
		at the convention. The stores, banks, and office buildings were 
		resplendent in a display of national flags, the Rotary emblem, and 
		Rotary colours.<br><br>Convention headquarters was in the government 
		building at the Canadian National Exhibition grounds. Here all visitors 
		registered and delegates presented their credentials and received their 
		official registration and delegates badges. The triennial Council on 
		Legislation had not yet been created. Then all legislation was brought 
		to the convention by a resolutions committee consisting of a small 
		number of men chosen by the president. Much time was spent at the 
		convention discussing the legislation but only official delegates could 
		vote. All plenary sessions of the Convention were held in the coliseum. 
		The large hall had been beautifully decorated, too.<br><br>The outgoing 
		President of Rotary International was Guy Gundaker, a restaurateur from 
		Philadelphia. The Canadian Director on the international board was J. 
		Gibson from Toronto. The Chair of the Canadian Advisory Committee was 
		Montreal Rotarian Bill Cairns, and the President of the Toronto Rotary 
		Club was Frank Littlefield. Many other Canadians participated in the 
		program including Canada's two Past Rotary International Presidents 
		Leslie Pidgeon and Crawford McCullough.<br><br>Registration took place 
		and a church service was held on Sunday. The convention proper started 
		on Monday 17 June. After a welcome by the mayor and others and the 
		invocation by PRIP Leslie Pidgeon, the work of the convention got 
		underway. Greetings were received from King George V of England, Prime 
		Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King of Canada, President Calvin 
		Coolidge of the United States and a host of other heads of state. And, 
		as was his custom, Paul Harris sent a message of support to the 
		Convention.<br><br>There was no overarching theme for the Convention 
		but, in addition to much business and several formal reports, three 
		themes were discussed and debated. First, mindful of one of the reasons 
		for Rotary's creation, business practice and ethics were examined. RI 
		President Gundaker delivered a major address on the subject. After a 
		brief review of the status of business codes by RI President-nominee 
		Donald Adams, a group of international Rotarians discussed the 
		development of business methods in their countries.<br><br>A second 
		emphasis of the convention was Rotary Extension and Membership, 
		especially in non-English speaking countries. Ever since Jim Davidson 
		and Layton Ralston's historic journey through the antipodes creating 
		Rotary clubs, Rotary extension had been a major interest of Canadian 
		Rotarians. As Chair of the RI Extension Committee PRIP Crawford 
		McCullough of Fort William, Ontario, reviewed Rotary's progress, and he 
		led a discussion on the subject.<br><br>The third theme and perhaps the 
		most important was &quot;International Friendship, Goodwill and Peace.&quot; Only 
		three years had elapsed since Halifax Rotarian Donald MacRae introduced 
		the Fourth (then the sixth) Object of Rotary at the Edinburgh Convention 
		in 1921, so interest in this new object was high. Some formal speeches 
		about international friendship were delivered, but in the main, the 
		meaning and means of developing friendships were conveyed through the 
		social atmosphere and activities at the Convention. For example, on 
		Monday evening 20,000 Rotarians, friends of Rotarians and visitors 
		attended the opening Goodwill Pageant at the grandstand on the Canadian 
		National Exhibition grounds. The pageant picturesquely demonstrated the 
		Fourth (sixth) Object of Rotary, using as its theme the understanding, 
		goodwill, and international peace that had existed between the United 
		States and Canada for over 100 years. It was agreed that the pageant was 
		the most elaborate spectacle staged at a Rotary convention to that date. 
		The story of the 100 years of peace was symbolically told in music, 
		brilliant tableaux, ballets, marching and countermarching of legions in 
		colourful costumes, the musical ride of the famous Royal Canadian 
		Mounted Police and, as a finale, a monstrous fireworks display.<br><br>
		Another vehicle for promoting friendship was the &quot;House of Friendship.&quot; 
		A Canadian invention, paid for by Canadian Rotarians, the House of 
		Friendship provided a place to meet friends, a place to make new 
		friendships, and a place to be entertained. As predicted, it became the 
		centre of social activities during the convention. The House of 
		Friendship soon became an established institution, featured at every 
		international convention and copied by many district conferences and 
		zone institutes. Rotary's very first House of Friendship was located in 
		the glass-domed horticultural building on the Canadian National 
		Exhibition grounds in 1924.<br><br>There was no shortage of 
		entertainment. A gala president's ball was held on Tuesday night. There 
		were district and reunion dinners, including a British Empire dinner, 
		organized by Jim Davidson. Three bands played at these luncheons and 
		dinners. The 2,300-voice Pageant Chorus, under the direction of Rotarian 
		Herbert Fricker presented a special concert at the coliseum on Thursday 
		evening. On Friday, Rotarians could attend a carnival of water sports, 
		take a moonlight cruise on Lake Ontario, join in group singing and there 
		were special programs for the ladies.<br><br>Canada's first Rotary 
		International Convention was a memorable one and set the standard for 
		other conventions that followed. <br><br>The Toronto Convention 1942<br>
		(Learning How to Live Together)<br><br>&quot;Learning how to live together&quot; 
		was the appropriate theme of Rotary International's 33rd annual 
		Convention hosted by the
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/conventions/1942/index.htm">
		Toronto Rotary Club</a> on the 21-25 June 1942.<br><br>World War II made 
		it difficult for Rotarians to attend. Sea lanes were blocked, rubber and 
		gasoline rationing dulled the desire to travel, but many came - 6,671 of 
		them. Three flew over from Britain for the event. Fifteen Latin-American 
		countries sent delegates, a smattering of exiled Rotarians from invaded 
		and war-torn lands in Europe and Asia managed to get there. In all, 33 
		countries were represented.<br><br>Rotary International President Tom 
		Davis from Butte Montana caught the spirit of the Convention when he 
		declared to the delegates &quot;Your presence is personal testimony to the 
		faith we jointly hold. Learning to live together is not just a catch 
		phrase but a declaration of purpose and challenge.&quot; And there were 
		plenty of challenges to face.<br><br>Tom Young, retiring Past President 
		of Rotary International in Great Britain and Ireland (R.I.B.I), revealed 
		how Rotarians in Britain were faring during the R.I.B.I. Rotarians had 
		contributed four X-Ray units and many other projects that contributed to 
		the war effort. Every fifth British dwelling had been damaged or 
		destroyed and Rotarians had suffered along with their countrymen.<br>
		<br>Several Rotary meeting places had been razed by bomb and fire. But 
		with Churchillian resolve, British Rotarians carried on. The Coventry 
		Club missed no more than two consecutive meetings, after the intense 
		bombing of the city. Though the membership of R.I.B.I. had decreased 
		somewhat, the number of new clubs increased by eight.<br><br>President 
		Davis delivered an encouraging report on Rotary around the world. 
		Despite the loss of some 400 clubs, primarily in occupied countries, on 
		1June 1942 Rotary International had 28 more clubs than a year previously 
		and the number of individual Rotarians had increased by 610. Despite the 
		optimism, a pallid gloom descended on the Convention when it was 
		announced that the port of Tobruk in Libya had fallen to the Germans.<br>
		<br>The Canadian National Exhibition could not be used as the convention 
		site as it was in 1924, because the spacious buildings had been taken 
		over by the military. The convention centre was moved to the Royal York 
		Hotel, the largest hotel in the British Empire, where the palatial 
		banquet rooms proved to be admirable quarters for the House of 
		Friendship, offices and booths. Plenary sessions were held in the Maple 
		Leaf Gardens.<br><br>A listing of the speakers and their subjects 
		indicate the kinds of issues Rotarians were concerned about in 1942.<br>

		the Board of Trustees of the Rotary Foundation and PRIP Crawford 
		McCullough Chaired Council on Legislation and presented the recommended 
		enactments to the Convention for approval.<br><br>There were a couple of 
		pleasant surprises at the Convention. A dramatic moment occurred when 
		Past RI Vice President Colonel Carlos P. Romulo of the Philippines spoke 
		to the Convention by short-wave radio from &quot;somewhere in Australia.&quot; As 
		usual, President Emeritus Paul Harris sent a message to the Convention 
		Chair to be read, but the Harrises surprised everyone when they walked 
		into the Convention unannounced. Jean Harris spoke to the Convention 
		briefly and Paul Harris read his Convention message himself. <br><br>
		Typically the entertainment was spectacular. Because the Maple Leaf 
		Gardens had a much larger seating capacity than was needed, tickets for 
		the opening and closing galas were sold to the public. The Toronto 
		Symphony orchestra under the direction of world-famous Sir Ernest 
		MacMillan thrilled the audience, with its rendition of classical and 
		semi-classical music. Mona Bates led the famous Ten Piano Ensemble in 
		two inspiring series. Then the sweetheart of millions the world over - 
		the incomparable Gracie Fields - performed. She sang beautiful war-time 
		songs with a clarity of tone and feeling and she sang humorous ballads 
		with verve. The grand finale on Thursday night was an ice carnival 
		presented by the finest professional and amateur skaters on the 
		continent. After a thrilling Victory Grand Finale came &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; 
		and &quot;God Save the King.&quot; <br><br>The Toronto Convention 1964<br>(Trends 
		for Tomorrow)<br><br>The 55th annual convention of Rotary International 
		held in Toronto drew 14,661 Rotarians and their guests, plus 1,295 young 
		people under 16 years, most of them Interactors. It was the sixth 
		largest convention in Rotary's history, and the second largest held 
		outside the United States. They came from 72 countries.<br><br>As in 
		1942, the plenary sessions were held in Maple Leaf Gardens, and the 
		House of Friendship and convention offices were housed in the Royal York 
		Hotel. Other activity locales were the Automotive Building at the 
		Canadian National Exhibition grounds, and Convocation Hall at the 
		University of Toronto and the O'Keefe Centre. Delegates and their guests 
		travelled around the city and to and from the convention sites by the 
		subway, which provided Rotarians with passes, and shuttle buses which 
		were also free.<br><br>Convention Chair Halsey B. Knapp, past 
		vice-president of Rotary International from Farmingdale, New York, got 
		the convention underway on Sunday evening. In a welcome address, W. Earl 
		Rowe, Lieutenant Governor of Ontario paid Rotary a fine tribute. &quot;I 
		believe,&quot; he said, &quot;that your organization and kindred societies have 
		done much more than people realize to eliminate racial distinctions, 
		class prejudices, and religious differences. The fact that you represent 
		different countries and have been able to get together those of 
		different classes, colour, and language has contributed much to the 
		understanding, the generous tolerance, and all that is so essential in a 
		troubled and excited world.&quot;<br><br>In a brief welcome R. I. President 
		Carl P. Miller, a newspaper publisher in California,
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/conventions/1964/1964.jpg" style="float: left">reminded 
		the delegates that, &quot;This had been a year of doing - a year in which 
		Rotarians found specific ways to advance international understanding.&quot; 
		Next, the presentation of the flags of the 72 countries in the Rotary 
		family of nations thrilled the assembly. Then the curtains opened on a 
		&quot;Canadian Musicalette, West by North,&quot; produced and directed by Toronto 
		orchestra leader Howard Cable. The audience enjoyed a bright and lively 
		evening of entertainment.<br><br>(Photo: &quot;President Carl. P. Miller and 
		Mrs Miller being piped into Maple Leaf Gardens, the site of the 1964 
		Convention&quot;)<br><br>Taking a clue from President Miller's international 
		theme &quot;Meeting Rotary's Challenge in the Space Age,&quot; the organizing 
		committee chose &quot;Trends for Tomorrow&quot; as the theme of the 1964 
		Convention. A number of prestigious speakers developed the theme.<br>
		<br>At the first plenary session on Monday morning, welcoming speakers 
		included Ontario Municipal Affairs Minister Wilfred Spooner, Toronto 
		Metropolitan Council Chair William R. Allen, Toronto Mayor Phillip 
		Givens, and Toronto Rotary Club President Clare D. Carruthers. The 
		keynote speaker at this session was Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. 
		Pearson who spoke about Canada's international relations, especially 
		with the United States. He informed the audience that Canada intended to 
		build a separate Canadian nation on the continent with a separate 
		Canadian identity.<br><br>U.S. Senator Clinton D. Anderson, Past 
		President of Rotary International, titled his talk Together to the 
		Stars. He predicted that space travel would bind together all earth men 
		and nations that together they may explore the stars.<br><br>Carlos P. 
		Romulo, President of the University of the Philippines and Past 
		President of the United Nations General Assembly related some inspiring 
		reasons for Why I am a Rotarian.<br><br>Canadian newspaper entrepreneur 
		British Lord Thompson of Fleet talked about Making Peace with the 
		Soviets. He was convinced &quot;that if we are to contemplate a peaceful, 
		happy existence for our children and our children's children we must 
		develop friendship and agreement with the Soviet Union.&quot; He made 
		headlines by suggesting that the time was ripe for a Rotary Club in 
		Moscow.<br><br>Special features, designed among other things to promote 
		and achieve international understanding and fellowship included the 
		following: <br><br>fifty-four craft assemblies at which Rotarians 
		displayed their hobby crafts;<br>Interact &quot;Buzz Sessions&quot; sought new and 
		better ways for the 400 Interact Clubs in 32 countries to serve their 
		constituencies;<br>twelve international friendship meetings;<br>
		international fellowship dinners;<br>reunion lunches;<br>more than 3,500 
		Rotarians, their wives and children participated in home hospitality 
		dinners in 375 homes;<br>reports by 12 participants in President Carl P. 
		Miller's great matched district exchange program and, of course, 
		informal meetings in the House of Friendship.<br><br>One plenary session 
		was spent discussing and voting on 39 enactments and eight proposed 
		resolutions recommended by the Council on Legislation whose 253 members 
		representing districts and regions from all over the world met all day 
		Saturday and half of Sunday debating. All the Council's recommendation

		The total paid registration at the 66th annual Rotary International 
		Convention held in the 333-year-old bilingual and multicultural City of 
		Montreal, Quebec, was 12,975. In addition there were 450 guests under 16 
		years of age for a total attendance of 13,425. They came from 87 of the 
		151 Rotary countries around the world. Sleek subway cars and buses 
		transported the participants to and from their 65 hotels and motels to 
		the Montreal Forum, the Convention Centre.<br><br>Pre-convention 
		activity on Saturday night consisted of a superb concert by the 60-voice 
		V'la l'Bon Vent Choir from Quebec attended by some 5,000 
		convention-goers. On Sunday afternoon, more than 200 youth exchange 
		officers, parents, and students met to exchange ideas on a program that 
		each year resulted in an exchange of 6,000 young people across national 
		boundaries.<br><br>The opening session of the convention convened in the 
		Montreal Forum at 8:00 p.m. on Sunday 8 June, with Jack Pride of Bath, 
		England, Chair of the 1975 Convention Committee, presiding. The flags of 
		Rotary nations were paraded smartly by young boys and girls. In his 
		welcoming remarks to the assembly, RI President William R. Robbins of 
		Ft. Lauderdale, Florida said: &quot;You have demonstrated over and over again 
		that the true strength of Rotary lives in the dedicated hearts of 
		individual Rotarians. The theme of this Convention is ‘Renew the 
		Spirit of Rotary.' Every convention event was designed to help the 
		individual answer the question, ‘What can I do?' to help meet the 
		needs and solve the problems.&quot;<br><br>The keynote speaker, Commissioner 
		Arnold Brown, Territorial Commander of the Salvation Army for Canada and 
		Bermuda and a member of the Rotary Club of Toronto, averred: &quot;This 
		assembly confirms that the sprit of Rotary is international - one of the 
		few truly binding forces in the world. It is one of its greatest 
		strengths. It subscribes to the principle that true fellowship and 
		service will survive the platforms of presidents and the decrees of 
		dictators.&quot; His inspirational address emphasized the importance and the 
		uniqueness of each human being. His trilogy of questions (What am I?) 
		(Who am I?) (Whose am I?) emphasized that any person can make a 
		contribution to a better world.<br><br>The Montreal Symphony Orchestra, 
		conducted by Rotarian Franz-Paul Decker presented a lively Viennese 
		program to round out the opening evening. Featured were Montreal soprano 
		Collette Boky and Holland-born John Van Kesteren, tenor.<br><br>On 
		Monday 9 June the sub-theme of the Convention was Renewing Vocational 
		Service. After welcoming speeches by Montreal's dynamic mayor, Jean 
		Drapeau and Montreal Club president Drew Webster, the vocational service 
		emphasis of he day was launched by the Governor of Bermuda, His 
		Excellency Sir Edwin Leather. &quot;Everything Rotary means by vocational 
		service is inherent in the adage ‘ Practice what you preach,'&quot; he 
		said. &quot;What is true of Rotary is equally true of human society,&quot; he 
		added. &quot;The crisis of our time,&quot; he claimed, &quot;can be fairly depicted by 
		the question, ‘Will the ideal of personal voluntary dedication to 
		public service in a free society survive?'&quot; He called for greater 
		self-discipline, stronger family bonds, and a sense of mutual 
		responsibility.<br><br>In his major address, President Bill Robbins drew 
		upon impressions gained in his travel to 32 countries during the year. 
		&quot;Rotary does not live in the high offices of the organization,&quot; he said. 
		&quot;It lives on main Street- in your heart and in mine -in your club and in 
		mine. Your Rotary Club is the sum total of the men of integrity who come 
		together, first as strangers and then as friends. It is here men find 
		mutual understanding, inspiration, and motivation. The true test of a 
		Rotary Club is the kind of men it produces.&quot;<br><br>On Monday afternoon, 
		Rotarians met in 55 different discussion groups called vocational craft 
		assemblies, each related to a business or profession for discussion 
		centred on ways of achieving high standards of work.<br><br>Also. in the 
		afternoon, the 400 young people in attendance at the Convention set off 
		on the first event of a four-day program that included visits to an 
		airline base, to an aircraft carrier in the St. Lawrence River, a bus 
		trip to the Laurentian mountains, a St. Lawrence Seaway/Montreal harbour 
		tour and bowling. On Monday evening, the Forum was once again the 
		setting for a beautiful program presented by Les Grande Ballets 
		Canadiens.<br><br>On Tuesday, the emphasis turned to renewing the 
		international service aspect of Rotary. The plenary session opened with 
		a report on The Rotary Foundation by Chair William E. Walk rand 11 
		trustees. During the previous year, 4, 000 new Paul Harris Fellows had 
		been created and an estimated $7 million had been raised. Three of the 
		original Rotary Scholars participated in a panel discussion, moderated 
		by RI Vice-president Wolfgang Wick, on the role of the individual in 
		promoting international understanding. The panel consisted of Sylvia 
		Bacon, Associate Judge of the Superior Court of the District of 
		Columbia, Owen S. Freed, an attorney in Florida, and the Honourable Marc 
		Lalonde, Minister of National Health and Welfare in the government of 
		Canada. All agreed that the individual can play an important role in 
		promoting international understanding and gave examples from their 
		experience. In the afternoon and evening, more than 2,000 Rotarians and 
		their guests were invited to the homes of Rotarians within a 100-mile 
		radius of Montreal.<br><br>&quot;Developing the Leadership Spirit&quot; was the 
		theme of Wednesday's plenary session. The entire audience was asked to 
		constitute itself as the nominating committee of the Rotary Club of 
		Conventionville. As such they were tasked with choosing the president of 
		the club for next year, from among three candidates. The club was having 
		problems: declining attendance, poor participation, little growth, 
		lack-luster activity. It needed good leadership. Max, Matthew, and 
		Orville - pseudonyms for three specialists in leadership motivation - 
		presented themselves as candidates for the office of president. Each 
		candidate offered a different style of leadership: Max was 
		authoritarian; Norman was a consensus seeker; and Orville a delegator of 
		responsibility. After each candidate read his prepared statement, the 
		three men engaged the audience in a lively discussion, moderated by RI 
		director-elect Dave Smith from Texas. A vote was eventually taken and 
		Orville, the delegator, won.<br><br>Ten international fellowship dinners 
		filled Montreal ballrooms in the evening. Following the dinners, 
		Rotarians and friends enjoyed dancing, fellowship and entertainment at 
		the Forum.<br><br>&quot;Action on Youth&quot; was the theme of Thursday's plenary 
		session. With Montreal as host of the Summer Olympic Games in 1976, it 
		was fitting that Rotary had invited Jesse Owens, winner of four gold 
		medals in the Olympic Games in Berlin in 1936 to address the audience. 
		Referring to his own experience, Owens spoke about faith and dreams. He 
		recalled his thoughts at the start of the 100-metre dash in 1936, when 
		his dream of being the world's fastest human being was about to be 
		realized. &quot;I thought about the hours of counselling, of work, of 
		coaching, and the men who helped me have faith in a dream.&quot; He told of 
		several Rotarians he knew who had helped youths reach their dreams. He 
		was particularly grateful that Rotarians had helped his fellow track 
		team members in a poor Cleveland school to acquire shoes and uniforms. 
		Jesse received a long standing ovation.<br><br>The final word of the 
		Convention went to RI President-elect Imbassahy de Mello of Brazil who 
		announced his theme for 1875-76 as &quot;To Dignify the Human Being.&quot; <br>

		<br>Toronto was the site of the 74th Annual Convention of Rotary 
		International and the fourth time in the history of Rotary International 
		that the Convention was held in that city. The theme of the Convention 
		was that of RI President Hiroji Mukasa of Japan for 1982-83 : &quot;Mankind 
		is One - Build Bridges of Friendship Throughout the World.&quot; Between 5 
		and 8 June 1983, 16,250 Rotarians and guests from 100 countries built 
		bridges of friendship as they gathered at the Royal York Hotel, site of 
		the House of Friendship and many other Convention activities and at 
		Maple Leaf Gardens, the location of all plenary sessions.<br><br>There 
		were a number of pre-convention activities and special events. District 
		Youth Exchange officers held a two-day meeting with more than 300 in 
		attendance. On Saturday evening the Toronto Rotary Club sponsored a 
		performance of the 100-piece Toronto Symphony Orchestra, under the baton 
		of Andrew Davis. On Sunday morning, an ecumenical church service at St. 
		Andrews Presbyterian Church was attended by many Rotarians, including 
		President and Mrs Hiroji Mukasa.<br><br>The first plenary session with 
		the theme &quot;Mankind is One&quot; took place on Sunday evening. The session 
		opened with the presentation of R.I. President Hiroji Mukasa and his 
		wife Kiyoko, the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, the Honorable John Aird 
		and Mrs Aird, who were escorted by the 1983 Convention Committee Chair, 
		Tibor Gregor a member of the Toronto Eglinton Rotary Club and Mrs 
		Gregor.<br><br>

		Bosley&quot;)<br><br>Following a welcome by the Lieutenant Governor and a 
		stirring procession and presentation of the flags of the Rotary World by 
		30 Youth Exchange students, Committee Chair Tibor Gregor declared the 
		74th Annual Convention of Rotary International open.<br><br>Addressing 
		the Convention on the theme &quot;Mankind is One,&quot; President Mukasa said, &quot;We 
		have seen how the human spirit proudly binds all peoples together 
		through service … we have seen Rotarians at work building bridges in 
		their own communities and in the world community at large.&quot; Highlighting 
		the unity of mankind, he said,&quot; I believe that the very future of the 
		human family depends on our accepting the concept that truly we are all 
		cousins, the concept that Mankind is One.&quot; He observed that &quot;only human 
		beings deeply feel the need for friendship and peace,&quot; and he added,&quot; to 
		get from the abstraction of what we believe to the reality of serving 
		others means we must mobilize the talents and resources within our 
		organization.&quot; <br><br>He stressed the need for emphasis on the 
		extension of Rotary and especially membership development.<br><br>
		Following the taking of the official photograph of the Convention, the 
		Rotarians and guests were entertained, delightfully, by a colourful, 
		vibrant, and exciting group of young Canadian entertainers in a special 
		program of music and dance entitled &quot;Singin' and Dancin' Tonight,&quot; 
		choreographed by Alan Lund.<br><br>The theme of the second plenary 
		session on Monday was &quot;Building Bridges of Friendship Throughout the 
		World.&quot; Incoming President of the Rotary Club of Toronto, Grant 
		Dickinson, welcomed the persons in attendance at the Convention on 
		behalf of his club and District 7070. General Secretary Herbert Pigman, 
		Evanston, Illinois, read messages from Governor General Schreyer of 
		Canada, Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada, and Prime Minister Nakasone of 
		Japan. Carlos Conseco Jr., of Monterrey, Mexico, was elected President 
		of Rotary International for 1984-85.<br><br>The first speaker was Dr. 
		John Evans, former president of the University of Toronto and recently 
		appointed director of the Population, Health, and Nutrition Department 
		of the World Bank. Evans' speech titled &quot;Health Versus Poverty: Can We 
		Tip the Balance?&quot; was preceded by a special audiovisual presentation 
		entitled &quot;The World Room,&quot; a film which shows how population, hunger, 
		and poverty are interrelated. Using statistics and drawing from his own 
		experience, Evans showed how poverty of the family and the individual 
		will perpetuate the cycle of illiteracy, high fertility, wastage, and 
		under-nutrition of children and limited opportunities for women. He 
		noted that the Rotary Foundation had risen to the challenge of the 
		health needs of the developing world through the Health, Hunger and 
		Humanity (3H) Program, launched in 1978.<br><br>Following Evans' 
		address, Hiroko Suenaga, wife of one of the R.I. Directors and one of 
		the most renowned pianists in Japan, played Chopin's &quot;Fantasie 
		Impromptu&quot; and Liszt's &quot;Hungarian Rhapsodie No. 6.&quot;<br>The final speaker 
		of the second plenary session was Dr. Rosey Grier, a star American 
		football player, entertainer, actor, and founder and chair of the board 
		of Giant Step, a not-for-profit organization that helps youth and 
		seniors. Rosey's address was titled &quot;Are You Committed?&quot; He soon had the 
		audience's rapt attention as he discussed why children turned to drugs 
		and other problems.<br><br>A sell-out crowd of 1,860 attended a luncheon 
		and fashion show at noon. In the afternoon there were the well-attended 
		International Idea Exchange Assemblies on &quot;Club Presidents&quot; and The 
		Future of Rotary.&quot;<br><br>In the evening a sell-out crowd of 4,800 
		Rotarians and guests attended seven International Fellowship &quot;Mystery&quot; 
		Dinners. When they arrived at the various hotel sites, they discovered 
		special entertainment features centred on national or regional themes.<br>
		<br>Tuesday's plenary session highlighted youth with the theme &quot;Youth 
		Shows the Way To build Bridges of Friendship,&quot; but the early part of the 
		program concentrated on management matters. Election of those who had 
		been nominated as Directors of Rotary International took place and 
		reports were presented by the General Secretary and the Treasurer of 
		Rotary International. John C. Spragge, member of the Rotary Club of 
		Toronto and vice-president of programming at the radio station CFRB, 
		talked about &quot;The Business of Rotary&quot; in which he discussed the meaning 
		of The Four-Way Test. President Mukasa presented a special presentation 
		citation to Mrs. Margerie Abramson, the daughter of James W. Davidson, 
		who as Honorary General Commissioner of Rotary organized Rotary clubs in 
		eleven countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East.<br><br>In a 
		Youth Exchange presentation entitled &quot;Pearls of Friendship,&quot; 125 young 
		people from Districts 7070,7040, and 7090 entertained the audience with 
		song, dance, and pageantry. Following the special presentation, Sharon 
		Keith, the winner of the President's Youth Exchange Essay Contest from 
		Zimbabwe, delivered her essay, entitled &quot;Mankind is One.&quot;<br><br>The 
		final speaker of the morning session was Dr. Bernard Lown, President of 
		the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, whose 
		subject was &quot;A Physician's Perspective on the Threat of Nuclear War.&quot; 
		Following Dr. Lown's address, the audience viewed a slide program 
		entitled &quot;Lighting Candles for Peace- International Service in Action.&quot;
		<br><br>After the plenary session there was a luncheon meeting, chaired 
		by PRID Harold H. Henderson, at which incoming RI President William E. 
		Skelton addressed the incoming club presidents and wives and district 
		governors-elect and wives. For the rest of the afternoon and evening 
		approximately 5,600 Rotarians and guests were hosted by Rotarians and 
		their wives in the Toronto area.<br><br>The theme of the final plenary 
		session on Wednesday was &quot;Building Bridges to the Future.&quot; The first 
		speaker was Finlander Rolf J.V. Klarch, incoming Chair of the Rotary 
		Foundation, who presented a report on the Rotary Foundation entitled 
		&quot;Living in a Changing World.&quot;<br><br>President Mukasa presented the 1983 
		Rotary Award for World Understanding to Canadian humanitarian Dr. Lotta 
		Hitschmanova, founder of USC, a Canadian sponsored program that provided 
		food, shelter, and medical care to refugees, especially to the children

		Skelton were introduced. Following his final address to the Convention 
		President Mukasa offered his heartfelt best wishes to Skelton who 
		addressed the Convention on the theme of Rotary International for 
		1983-84: &quot;Share Rotary-Serve People.&quot; To implement the theme for 
		1983-84, President-elect Skelton announced the launching of the 
		Presidential Citation Program that would challenge Rotary Clubs to meet 
		goals in growth and service.(The author served as club president in 
		1983-84 and had the honour of receiving a Presidential Citation.) In the 
		afternoon there were 15 discussion groups on the programs of Rotary.<br>
		<br>In the evening thousands of Rotarian and guests gathered for the 
		President's Reception and Family Night at Ontario Place, a lake-side 
		theme park of islands, walkways, boat harbours and uniquely-shaped 
		buildings.<br><br>The Calgary Convention 1996<br>(Act with Integrity 
		Serve with Love Act for Peace)<br><br>The eighty-seventh Annual 
		Convention of Rotary International was held in Calgary, Alberta, on 23 
		to 26 June 1996. The Saddledome, constructed for the 1988 Olympic Winter 
		Games, was the focal point for the historic international gathering. 
		With an attendance of 24,963 Rotarians and guests from 126 countries and 
		geographical areas, this was the largest Rotary International Convention 
		ever staged in North America.<br><br>Because of the large number of 
		registrants, the first plenary session took place in two seatings. The 
		first seating and opening feature of the Convention convened on Sunday 
		afternoon at 1530 hours with RI President Herbert C. Brown of 
		Clearwater, Florida, presiding. The session opened with &quot;Let there be 
		Peace on Earth,&quot; a musical multimedia celebration of the President's 
		theme. This performance featured 4-year-old piano virtuoso Wesley Chu, 
		Canada's Children's World Chorus, and a large cast of singers, dancers, 
		ice skaters, and musicians, accompanied with special effects.<br><br>
		Next, President Brown introduced Jack Forrest, Chair of the 1996 
		Convention Committee who welcomed the Rotarians and guests. Forrest 
		introduced RI Vice President Richard Slager who gave the afternoon's 
		invocation. Then Forrest introduced PRIVP Curly Galbraith and a member 
		of the Calgary Rotary Club and Vice-Chair of the Committee, who spoke 
		briefly. The next order of business was the roll call of Rotary's 154 
		countries and geographical areas by RI Director John Kenny of 
		Grangemouth, Scotland, who read the list as the flags were presented - 
		for the first time ever on ice - by members of the Calgary Skating Club.<br>
		<br>Following the presentation of flags, VP Slager introduced the 
		1995-96 RI President Herb Brown who performed, in sequence, the 
		following activities: asked the audience to stand for the national 
		anthems of Canada and the United States; as the audience watched a 
		screen, President Brown pressed a button that ceremoniously lit the 
		Calgary Torch of Peace, located in top of the Calgary Tower in downtown 
		Calgary. Reminiscent of the Calgary Winter Olympic Games, the torch 
		celebrated the opening of the Calgary Convention, and like the Olympic 
		torch, burned until the Convention was over; after introducing a short 
		video highlighting the history of Rotary in Canada, the President 
		introduced his Excellency, the Right Honourable Romeo LeBlanc, Governor 
		General of Canada who addressed the Convention.<br><br>After the 
		Governor General's remarks, President Brown introduced and thanked his 
		aide Frank Devlyn - a future President of Rotary International - who, in

		delivered his opening address to the Convention.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/images/1996hoopdancer.jpg" style="float: left">Concluding 
		both seatings of the Sunday plenary session was a dazzling entertainment 
		program called &quot;O Canada: Land of Beauty and Bounty.&quot; Canada's 
		multicultural heritage was the them of the program that included 
		spectacular performances by singers, musicians, dancers portraying 
		different nations and cultures, ice skaters, and an acrobatic display by 
		the Cirque du Soliel of Montreal.<br><br>President Brown called the 
		second plenary session to order at 0930 hours and invited Harold 
		Greyeyes, of North Battleford, Saskatchewan to give the day's 
		invocation. Then RI General Secretary Geoffrey Large read greetings to 
		the Convention from Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr&#7867;tien, United States 
		President Bill Clinton, and Florida Governor Lawton Chiles. Large made a 
		few routine announcements and informed the Convention that the reports 
		of the secretary and treasurer were available in the House of 
		Friendship. Then President Brown introduced Ralph Klein, Premier of the 
		Province of Alberta, who addressed the Convention.<br><br>After the 
		Premier's speech President Brown introduced and thanked the members of 
		the 1995-96 Rotary International Board of Directors. He then called to 
		the stage and recognized 12 Past Presidents of Rotary International, 
		from 1978-79 on. The next part of the session featured a special singing 
		group from Novosibirsk, Russia. Known as the Rotary Russian Peace 
		Ensemble, the group had recently completed a concert tour in the United 
		States and Canada. The five member ensemble delighted the Convention 
		with the singing of three songs of peace.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/images/1996challangeaward.jpg" style="float: left">Much 
		of the rest of the session was taken up by the presentation of awards to 
		winners of &quot; The Calgary Challenge&quot;- a Rotary district membership growth 
		challenge issued by then President- elect Herb Brown at the Rotary 
		International Convention in Nice, France, in June 1995. To qualify for 
		an award at the 1996 Convention, a district had to increase membership 
		to a goal representing the total set by all club goals in the district. 
		Each Rotarian was asked to sponsor a new member. A winning district was 
		selected from each of the 34 Rotary zones in the world, and 16 
		additional winners were selected as the top districts overall. In each 
		winning district, a winning club was identified. President Brown invited 
		Past RI Director Richard D. King, Chair of the Membership Task Force to 
		the stage to explain the program and announce the winners. As the band 
		played, King announced the 50 winning districts and their governors, 35 
		of whom filed on the stage to receive from President Brown the crystal 
		award, specifically designed for the Rotary Challenge.<br><br>King then 
		announced the three district runners-up. Next, King asked the audience 
		to join him in welcoming to the stage the world champion winner of the 
		Calgary Challenge, District Governor Dong-Kurn Lee and his spouse 
		Yung-la, from District 3650 in Korea. His District chartered 32 new 
		Rotary clubs and increased membership by nearly 1,783 new Rotarians. 
		Awards were given to two other Governors of small districts. King then 
		recognized the Zone Co-ordinators and announced the total increase 
		worldwide as 800 new Rotary clubs chartered and an increased membership 
		of 66,876. President Brown then presented PRID King with a Calgary 
		Challenge crystal award for his leading role in the membership drive.<br>
		<br>The President spoke briefly about his year-long effort to focus the 
		attention of Rotarians around the world on the plight of families. He 
		informed the audience that the RI Board of Directors had designated the 
		second week in February each year as &quot;Rotary Family Week&quot; - a time for 
		Rotarians to demonstrate their commitment to family and community 
		through projects, activities and events. The audience then viewed a 
		video depicting Rotary projects targeting families and communities in 
		need and calling on Rotarians to expand their efforts in these areas.<br>
		<br>President Brown then introduced his wife, Diane Brown, who gave a 
		speech titled &quot;Family Values: A Foundation for Peace.&quot; During her 
		address she introduced Margaret Aileen T. Castillo, the 12-year-old girl 
		from the Philippines who won the 1995-96 RI children's poster contest. 
		At the conclusion of Diane's speech President Brown adjourned the second 
		plenary session. <br><br>President Brown called the third plenary 
		session to order on Tuesday morning at 0930 hours, and asked Donald 
		Kwait of the Rotary Club of Chagrin Highlands, Ohio, to give the 
		invocation. After General Secretary Large made announcements, President 
		Brown introduced Calgary Mayor Al Duerr, who addressed the Convention. 
		Next he introduced Nobel laureate Betty Williams, who addressed the 
		Convention. The president gave her a crystal globe and his theme pin.<br>
		<br>The President then introduced Rotary Foundation Trustee Chair Paulo 
		V.C. Costa, who, in turn, introduced and thanked his fellow trustees for 
		1995-96. Next, Chair Costa recognized the 31 districts whose members 
		successfully met a challenge established four years before, in honour of 
		the 75th anniversary of the Rotary Foundation: to enrol 75 new 
		Benefactors in each district within a five year period. After that, 
		Chair Costa gave his speech to the convention.<br><br>President Brown 
		then announced United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs Sadako 
		Ogata, that year's recipient of Rotary's highest honour - The Rotary 
		Award for International Understanding. A video was shown, depicting 
		Sadako Ogata's work for Refugees around the world. At the conclusion of 
		the video, the President introduced Mrs. Sadako Ogata, and presented her 
		with the crystal flame statue, symbolic of selfless service. Mrs Sadako 
		Ogata then addressed the audience. After a musical interlude, Foundation 
		Chair Paulo Costa was again introduced.<br><br>The rest of the session 
		was taken up with a discussion by the trustees and PRIPs about the 
		programs of the Rotary Foundation, with great emphasis placed on the 
		magnificent PolioPlus Program. Two awards were presented by visitors and 
		supporters of the Rotary PolioPlus Program. Dr William H. Foege, one of 
		the world's foremost immunologists and Chair of the UN's Task Force for 
		Child Survival, presented an award to President Brown on behalf of 
		UNICEF, WHO, the World Bank, UNDP, and UNFPA in recognition of Rotary's 
		commitment and work in the eradication of Polio. On behalf of Rotarians 
		worldwide, President Brown accepted the award on behalf of Rotary 
		International and The Rotary Foundation.<br><br>Dr Bill Cochrane and Dr 
		Randal Chase, representing the President of the Connaught Laboratories, 
		one of the leading manufacturing pharmaceutical laboratories in the 
		world, with two awards. Dr Cochrane presented Foundation Chair Paulo 
		Costa with a plaque dedicated to the continuance of eradication of 
		polio, on behalf of children everywhere. Dr. Chase presented Costa with 
		one million doses of oral polio vaccine. Chair Costa accepted the 
		vaccine on behalf of The Rotary Foundation and the children of the 
		world.<br><br>Then children of all ages carrying balloons filed onto the 
		stage as a pianist played &quot;It's a Small World&quot; on the piano. The 
		youngsters lined up and joined hands with the Rotarians on the stage for 
		the remainder of the song as the audience applauded.<br><br>President 
		Brown then adjourned the third plenary session.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/images/1996chuchwagon.jpg" style="float: left">The 
		Family Fellowship Roundup on Tuesday evening gave visitors a preview of 
		the world-famous Calgary Stampede with a parade, chuck wagon races, and 
		a grandstand show. <br><br>President Brown called the fourth plenary 
		session to order on Wednesday morning at 0930 hours, and asked RI 
		Director Kalyan Banerjee of India to give the day's invocation. After 
		the invocation, President Brown advised that the next part of the 
		session would be devoted to preserving planet earth as he presented a 
		project undertaken by many Rotarians to promote awareness of 
		environmental problems. The project was the Preserve Planet Earth 
		Marathon.<br><br>In 1990, under the leadership of then President Paulo 
		V.C. Costa, Rotary International launched a program known as &quot;Preserve 
		Planet Earth,&quot; which encouraged Rotary clubs to help solve the 
		environmental problems of their communities. In 1992, the United Nations 
		Environmental Convention, ECO-92, was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It 
		was there, on World Environment Day, that Rotary announced its 
		inauguration of the Preserve Planet Earth Rotary Ecology Marathon. The 
		marathon spanned a five-year period from June 1992. Its purpose was to 
		encourage 1,000 Rotary clubs along the main route to organize 1,000 
		environmental-awareness events that would provide 1,000 solutions to 
		existing ecological concerns. For more than 1,800 days, Rotarians of the 
		Americas carried an environmental awareness award to these clubs, 
		districts and countries along the route. The award, accompanied by a 
		Rotary flag, depicts two pairs of hands holding up a clean, clear, 
		transparent globe. Since it began four years earlier, the Rotary's 
		ecology marathon , with side trips to Antarctica and Siberia, passed 
		through 17 nations and 150 cities of the Americas with the help of 57 
		Rotary districts and 7,000 Rotarians and volunteers.<br><br>A video 
		describing the marathon was shown, including clips of its leader, 
		Mexican Rotarian Jorge Rojo. At the conclusion of the video, President 
		Brown announced that they were about to celebrate the arrival of the 
		marathon in Calgary. Another video was shown, picturing Jorge Rojo 
		running on the streets of Calgary, carrying the Marathon flag and 
		statue. The camera followed him into the plenary hall and onto the 
		stage, at which point Paulo Costa joined him and jogged a few paces. 
		Rojo addressed the audience in Spanish and handed a Preserve Planet 
		Earth statue to President Brown, who gave Rojo a presidential crystal. 
		He then introduced Oscar Arias Sanchez, former president of Costa Rica 
		and Nobel Peace Prize winner, who addressed the Convention. Next, the 
		Rotary Russian Peace Ensemble sang &quot;Let There Be Peace on Earth.&quot;<br>
		<br>President Brown then announced the annual election of RI officers 
		and called General Secretary Large to the podium to conduct the 
		election. RI directors and district governors were elected and then, 
		there being no other nominations for the position, General Secretary 
		Large announced that the President had declared Glen W. Kinross of 
		Hamilton, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia to be the president-nominee of 
		Rotary International for 1997-98. President Brown presented 
		president-nominee Glen Kinross and his wife Heather to the Convention. 
		The president-nominee then delivered his acceptance speech to the 
		Convention.<br><br>RI president-elect Luis Vicente Giay from Argentina 
		introduced members of the 1996-97 RI Board of Directors. President Brown 
		introduced Glenn Estess Sr., aide to President Giay and his wife Mary 
		who then introduced the family of the President-elect. The 
		President-elect then addressed the Convention. Next, President Brown 
		directed the transfer of the presidential banner from his Rotary Club in 
		Clearwater, Florida, to President-elect Giay's Rotary Club in Buenos 
		Aires, Argentina.<br><br>Next, slides were shown promoting Glasgow, 
		Scotland, site of the 1997 RI Convention. Afterwards, Scottish bagpipers 
		and a drum corps marched on stage, followed by dancers in kilts who gave 
		an animated entertainment preview. After a humorous review of Scottish 
		history and customs, by host Organization Chair George Boyd, 
		President-elect Giay introduced Lord and Lady Provost of Glasgow who 
		were applauded as they appeared on stage wearing the Rotary tartan. Lord 
		Provost extended a welcome to all Rotarians to visit Glasgow, the city 
		of architecture and design. Following another video promoting 
		Glasgow-area attractions and another Scottish dance performance, 
		President Brown adjourned the fourth plenary session.<br><br>Prepared by
