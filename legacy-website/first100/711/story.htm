		They discussed Harris' idea that business leaders should meet 
		periodically to enjoy camaraderie and to enlarge their circle of 
		business and professional acquaintances. The club met weekly; membership 
		was limited to one representative from each business and profession. 
		Though the men didn't use the term Rotary that night, that gathering is 
		commonly regarded as the first Rotary club meeting. 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/schiele/index.htm#Schieles 1938">[From the May 1938 
		issue of The Rotarian Silvester Schiele describes the start of Rotary]</a><br>
		<br>As they continued to convene, members began rotating their meetings 
		among their places of business, hence the name Rotary. After enlisting a 
		fifth member, printer 5Harry Ruggles, the group was formally organized 
		as the Rotary Club of Chicago. The original club emblem, a wagon wheel 
		design, was the precursor of the familiar cogwheel emblem now used by 
		Rotarians worldwide.<br><br>By the end of 1905, the club's roster showed 
		a membership of 30 with Schiele as president and Ruggles as treasurer. 
		Paul Harris declined office in the new club and didn't become its 
		president until two years later. Club membership grew, making it 
		difficult to gather in offices, so the members shifted their meetings to 
		hotels and restaurants, where many Rotary club meetings are held today.<br>
		<br>These early &quot;Rotarians&quot; realized that fellowship and mutual 
		self-interest were not enough to keep a club of busy professionals 
		meeting each week. Reaching out to improve the lives of the less 
		fortunate proved to be an even more powerful motivation. The Rotary 
		commitment to service began in 1907 when the Rotary Club of Chicago 
		constructed that city's first public lavatory. With this inaugural 
		project, Rotary became the world's first serviceClub organization.<br>
		<br>Three years after Paul Harris' inspired idea, a San Francisco 
		business person by the name of Homer Wood happened to have a 
		conversation with a friend from Chicago who told him about their &quot;club.&quot; 
		Woods grasped the concept and organized the Rotary Club of San Francisco 
		in 1908. In a single year, 1909, Woods personally formed 6clubs 3, 4, 
		and 5, in Oakland, California; Seattle, Washington; and Los Angeles, 
		California. Then one of the San Francisco Rotarians, that same year, 
		started the ball rolling for Club #6 in New York, New York. By December, 
		Boston, Massachusetts was number 7 and Seattle formed Tacoma, Washington 
		as number 8. <br><br>Paul Harris had been hoping for this and now the 
		Chicago club really caught the bug, this thing was going to be big. The 
		first place they headed was Minneapolis, Minnesota, which became number 
		9. Some St. Paul folks heard about this meeting and hurried over in time 
		to meet with these people from Chicago and they became number 10.<br>
		<br>When the National Association of Rotary Clubs held its first 
		convention in 1910, there were 16 clubs. Those sixteen are known as the 
		&quot;organizational clubs as there was no provision for a &quot;charter&quot; to be 
		granted since no formal institution existed to issue a charter. Harris 
		was elected president.<br><br>At the following year's convention, speakers 
		used the phrases &quot;Service, Not Self&quot; and &quot;He Profits Most Who Serves 
		Best,&quot; which became the organization's mottoes. &quot;Service, Not Self,&quot; was 
		later changed to &quot;Service Above Self&quot; and has since been adopted as 
		Rotary's primary motto.<br><br>

		<img class="auto-style28" height="162" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/711/images/schiele_small.jpg" style="float: left" width="106">1&quot;There was Silvester, a coal 
		dealer, our first president, he was of German parentage. His was a 
		kindly nature and his face wont to light up with pleasure on meeting 
		friends. He told interesting stories of his boyhood home on an Indiana 
		farm, revealing the picture of a log cabin and family group around the 
		fire place. He Told of the hardships of early life; for example, of the 
		snow that used to pelt through he chinks in the roof of the attic in 
		which he slept, forming miniature drifts upon the floor. He treasure the 
		memory of those early days. Though his life in Chicago had been a 
		struggle, he had managed to be helpful to the younger members of his 
		family.<br><br>He had responded to his country's call in its time of need, 
		serving in Cuba during the Spanish-American war. Cleary he was eligible. 
		Succeeding years have demonstrated the wisdom of the selection; 
		Silvester fills a worthy place, and his life becomes increasingly useful 
		with advancing years. He is the center of community activities and 
		church work, the key man in charitable undertakings. Many young Men have 
		him to thank for years of wise counsel. Many crippled children have him 
		to thank for physical rehabilitation. To Silvester every human need is a 
		command. His telephone rings night and day, but he is never too tired to 
		respond although his health is not always the best, and he is very tired 
		at times. During the early days of the depression, and until the 
		charities in his part of the city were put on an organized basis, 
		Sylvester's office was made to serve as a clearing-house, and many 
		hundred needy were given relief.<br><br>While Sylvester's most manifest 
		contribution to the common weal has been through community service, his 
		contribution through vocational service, that is, in the management of 
		his own business has been scarcely less commendable. His &quot;turn over&quot; 
		among employees have always been negligible, though he has had many 
		trying cases to deal with.<br><br>His foreman in Charge, who has been 
		many years in Sylvester's service, never fails to avail himself of every 
		opportunity to speak a good work of his boss. More than once he has told 
		the writer that if anything ever happens to the &quot;Old Man&quot; to make it 
		necessary to him to discontinue the management of the business, he will 
		terminate his service, because he never could be satisfied to work for 
		another after having worked so long for the &quot;Old Man.&quot;<br><br>
		Sylvester's record in community service, vocational service, as a 
		humanitarian, neighbor and friend, will stand a lot of beating, as the 
		English put it. To put it in other words, it is a splendid 
		exemplification of the doctrine of Rotary in action. In the very early 
		days of rotary, Silvester sponsored the reading of papers on the 
		respective vocations of the members. Was it the beginning of the 
		Vocational service activity in Rotary? Perhaps not, but it certainly was 
		in perfect keeping with the developments which came further on&quot;.<br><br>

		merchant tailor who hailed from the state of Maine, was of the number. 
		He was an agreeable fellow. He had never quite reconciled himself to 
		life in a large city; in fact, through all the years his thoughts have 
		constantly reverted to the state of his nativity. There he spends his 
		summer vacations, and to the rock-ribbed state of Main he will 
		eventually return to spend his remaining days.<br><br>Hiram, due to 
		circumstances beyond his control, did not retain his membership in the 
		club, though he has frequently manifested interest in the movement and 
		shown that he cherishes the memory of the early days.&quot; PH<br><br>Hiram

		promoter. His personality challenged attention. His was a rare 
		combination, the good in him easily out-weighing the bad. He was a 
		stormy petrel, vehement, impetuous, imperative, domineering, in one 
		breath; then calm docile and lovable in the next. He was always 
		thought-compelling; his words were spoken with lightning-like rapidity, 
		and with such force that men frequently stopped in the street to look at 
		him. His educational advantage has been limited, but his English was 
		classical. Where he found expression, was a quandary. Gus' membership 
		was of brief duration. The feverish ups and downs of business resulted 
		first in his resignation from membership, and a few years later in his 
		Death. Requiescat in pace. Dear Gus, you rested little while here.&quot; PH 
		(An essay on Gus Loehr, the tenant of Room 711)<br><br>4The &quot;Rotarian 
		Magazine&quot; version of this story and those from first hand narrative in 
		books by Chicago, San Francisco and Oakland (clubs 1, 2 &amp; 3) vary. It 
		does appear that several years of informal discussions took place and 
		that the &quot;first meeting&quot; might have been part happenstance and part 
		planning, but was destined, in the mind of Paul Harris, to happen. This 
		&quot;dream&quot; had been brewing for years. Conversations with Silvester Schiele 
		are witness to that.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style28" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/711/images/ruggles_small.jpg" style="float: left">5&quot;Harry, a printer, was number five. He measured 
		up to every requirement, insofar as his business habits were concerned; 
		he was reliable, punctual, and straight-forward; dishonesty was to him 
		incomprehensible. The only question in the minds of the others was, &quot;How 
		does he stand in the point of fellowship?&quot; He seemed cold, unemotional, 
		and inexperienced in the ways of men. Harry had been raised raised on a 
		farm in northern Michigan. He father had been an upright and religious 
		man, whose weakness bed been his childish faith in all mankind. As a 
		consequence, his cupboard was so frequently bare that the belief that 
		man was created for the purpose of waging merciless warfare against 
		poverty was deeply embedded in young Harry's mind. Also see Harry 
		Ruggles, Early Leader<br><br><br><br><br>

		pledged himself to interest some suitable resident of the city of the 
		Golden Gate in the organization of a club. In homer Wood, a young 
		lawyer, he found the right man. Homer not only organized a club in his 
		own city, but in conjunction with other friends organized clubs number 
		three in Oakland, and number four in Los Angeles.<br><br><br><br><br>
