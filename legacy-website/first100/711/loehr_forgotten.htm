		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19"  width: 50%>On the frigid evening 
		of February 23, 1905, four men met in a small Chicago office to discuss 
		a visionary idea—the formation of a society of professional men for 
		business and social purposes.<br><br>Although many such groups exist 
		today, it was an unusual idea for the time; still, it seemed like a 
		simple plan. But from that informal gathering rose one of the greatest 
		service organizations in the history of the world; Rotary International. 
		Now with over 1.2 million members in over 160 countries, Rotary is 
		credited with countless achievements, from the war on polio to world 
		hunger to education, community health, and civic events. Nearly every 
		individual in the United States, and many others around the world, has 
		been touched in some way by Rotary’s efforts. <br><br>That meeting in Chicago is 
		credited as the first Rotary meeting and, in turn, the four associates 
		are now known as Rotary’s “first four.” They are indeed a group of men 
		who share the same traits of vision and character. First among them was 
		Paul Harris, an attorney who came up with the idea of the club, and its 
		eventual name, Rotary. Harris devoted the rest of his life to 
		championing the growth and causes of Rotary International and is revered 
		even today by Rotarians worldwide. Harris’ close friend, coal dealer 
		Sylvester Schiele, likewise was a lifelong Rotarian whose contributions 
		to the organization were indeed great in number and scale. However, a 
		third, tailor Hiram Shorey, was only briefly a member of Rotary in its 
		fledgling early days.<br><br>The fourth man was a mining engineer named 
		Gustave Loehr. He was the host of that first meeting, as his three 
		friends met in his small downtown office on that cold night. Like 
		Shorey, Loehr spent little time with the club; he is known to have 
		attended only the first three meetings before resigning due to his 
		business interests. Only a few years later, as Rotary was enjoying 
		explosive growth, Loehr suffered a sudden death.<br><br>In his lifetime, 
		Loehr received very little credit for his involvement in the founding of 
		Rotary, and little is known of him today. But Gus Loehr should not be 
		forgotten, as he was the host of the first Rotary meeting and one of the 
		founders of what grew into the world’s foremost service organization. 
		His is a story of an average man who was a player in a great beginning.<br>
		<br>One of Loehr’s acquaintances was Paul Harris, a thirty-six-year old 
		attorney who, like Loehr, had come from a small town. Born just to the 
		north of Chicago in Racine, Wisconsin, Harris had later lived in 
		Wallingford, Vermont as a youth and had earned his law degree from the 
		University of Iowa. After considerable travel across the United States 
		and through Europe, Harris finally settled in Chicago and built a 
		successful practice.<br><br>It is Harris who gives us one of the most 
		detailed descriptions of Loehr’s character; that of a bright and 
		well-spoken, yet emotional and high-strung, individual.<br><br>His 
		personality challenged attention. His was a rare combination, the good 
		in him easily outweighing the bad. He was a stormy petrel, vehement, 
		impetuous, imperative, domineering in one breath; then calm, docile, and 
		lovable in the next. He was always thought-compelling; his words were 
		spoken with lightning-like rapidity, and with such force that men 
		frequently stopped in the street to look at him. His educational 
		advantages had been limited, but his English was classical. Where he 
		found the vocabulary with which to give his furious thoughts expression, 
		was a quandary. <br><br>Another account of Loehr’s personality offers a 
		similar portrait, although with humane ideals.<br><br>Loehr was 
		temperamental and volatile. One moment he could be talking vehemently 
		and gesticulating wildly. Within seconds the mood would pass and he 
		would become gentle as a lamb. Loehr was generous almost to a fault. He 
		would cheerfully give his last cent to help a friend, and no one was too 
		lowly to be the recipient of his sympathy (including) elevator 
		operators, janitors, and cleaners. He was, without doubt, a man of 
		character. <br><br>While Loehr’s business interests brought him in 
		contact with many people, close friendships were hard to come by in the 
		swirl of humanity that was the city of Chicago. Harris had the same 
		problem; he knew many people, but he had few close friends. Accustomed 
		to the relationships of small towns, Harris took long walks through city 
		parks and attended church services of all denominations, but found it 
		difficult to form close ties to others. He had met many people in his 
		profession, and that led Harris to wonder; why could not his business 
		friends also be his social friends? <br><br>Loehr could not have known 
		it at the time, but, in his office, he had hosted the first-ever Rotary 
		meeting. From that informal gathering of the “first four” on that 
		freezing night in February, the organization known as Rotary would grow 
		into a membership of over 1.2 million members in over 31,000 clubs in 
		over 160 countries. Although community service was not discussed in 
		those early meetings, Rotary later evolved into one of the world’s great 
		service organizations, with countless projects to its credit. Its seeds 
		were planted in his Room 711 of the Unity Building; Gustave Loehr was an 
		original Rotarian. <br><br>But Loehr would not enjoy the growth of 
		Rotary. He was present at the third meeting, but there is no record of 
		him at subsequent gatherings. Harris writes that Loehr resigned due to 
		“the feverish ups and downs of business,” which Walsh describes as 
		“volatile as his personality.” Indeed, it appears that Loehr’s vocation 
		as a mining engineer was not a solid one. It would not be the last time 
		that Gus’ roller-coaster business affairs would cost him.<br><br>In the 
		annals of the organization, it appears that Loehr attended but three 
		meetings—the first three Rotary meetings ever. But his place in Rotary 
		is indisputable; he hosted the first meeting and was one of the “first 
		four” Rotarians in the club’s illustrious history. <br><br>After six 
		meetings, the Chicago Rotary Club discontinued its practice of meeting 
		in members’ offices and began to assemble in various restaurants and 
		hotels. More and more businessmen flocked to the club, and by 1908, a 
		second club was founded in San Francisco. From there, the drive to 
		organize led to Oakland, then to Seattle, Los Angeles, New York, and 
		Washington. Then Rotary went across the borders, to Ireland, England, 
		and Canada; within a few years, clubs were established in Asia, South 
		and Central America, and elsewhere in Europe. By 1912, there were fifty 
		clubs with 5,000 total members worldwide. Only two years later—and only 
		nine years after that first meeting at the Unity—the 100th Rotary Club 
		was founded in Phoenix. Indeed, these were great years for the 
		burgeoning Rotary movement in America and around the world. <br><br>Upon 
		his death on May 23, 1918, Gustave Loehr received very little 
		recognition for his role in the organization of Rotary. Neither of his 
		obituaries in the two newspapers of his hometown of Carlinville, 
		Illinois mentioned Rotary, nor did death notices in the nearby Gillespie 
		and Springfield papers. In addition, the tiny notice of Loehr’s death in 
		the Chicago Tribune did not include his involvement in the club. <br>
		<br>By comparison, Harris, the generating force behind Rotary’s 
		explosive growth and collective respect, became a sort of international 
		celebrity whose memory is cherished by Rotarians even today. Harris, who 
		authored three books on the history of Rotary before his death on 
		January 27, 1947, is buried in Mount Hope Cemetery in Blue Island, south 
		of Chicago. Sylvester Schiele, also a lifetime Rotarian, lies near 
		Harris’ grave; both men and their families continued a close 
		relationship throughout their lives. Local members of Rotary maintain a 
		beautiful monument and walking path at Mount Hope to honor the memories 
		of these cherished Rotarians. By contrast, Loehr’s grave in Carlinville 
		is nondescript; the gray headstone, which matches those of his parents 
		and three siblings in the family plot, simply reads “Gustave H. Loehr 
		1864-1918.” <br><br>Should Loehr hold a valued place in Rotary? He 
		attended only three meetings, the first three in club history. Even his 
		friend Paul Harris, sympathetic to Loehr in other writings, bluntly 
		declared in his 1948 My Road to Rotary that Loehr “failed to follow 
		through.” There is little doubt that Loehr’s brief membership is the 
		principal reason that his life, and his role in the formation of Rotary, 
		have often been overlooked. In addition, while Harris and others 
		remember Loehr’s fine qualities, there is little else in his life, 
		professionally or personally, that distinguishes him. One might argue 
		that Loehr simply had the good fortune to have a friend like Harris, the 
		good timing to host the first meeting, and the good sense to recognize a 
		great idea. <br><br>But to gloss over Loehr is to miss a crucial part of 
		the history of Rotary International. Many figures in history have been 
		fortunate, or otherwise, to be a part of a seemingly simple event that 
		later changes the world. Loehr—or any of the other three men that night 
		at the Unity—could not have possibly seen the future of what they were 
		creating. But what was to come was indeed spectacular, as the millions 
		of past and present Rotarians, and the billions of people and the 
		numerous causes they have helped, will tell you.<br><br>To overlook any 
		aspect of history is an injustice. It is only proper to remember Loehr 
		for his role in a visionary idea whose roots came from a meeting in his 
		cramped Chicago office on a cold February night a century ago. That 
		Rotarians today honor Loehr is a deserving credit for the part this 
		“original Rotarian” played in the creation of an idea that, in many 
		ways, helped shape the world we know today. <br><br>&quot;Excerpted from
