		all the 'Gang of Four', Gustave Henry Loehr (far left), usually 
		described as a 'mining engineer', is in some ways the least well 
		remembered since like&nbsp;Hiram Shorey, he only remained in Rotary for a 
		very short time.<br><br>Like&nbsp;Silvester Schiele, Gus Loehr was from a 
		German background. Unlike Schiele, he was a first generation American, 
		born in Carlinville, Macoupin County, Illinois, not too far from Chicago 
		on 18 October 1864, the son of Johann Christian Loehr, a dry goods 
		merchant, and his wife Frederika Knabner. Johann Christian was born in 
		Brunswick, Germany 1827, as the 1880 census describes him as being aged 
		53.<br><br>His wife is 
		also recorded in the census as born in Saxony and aged 49. The Loehrs 
		landed from Europe in New Orleans, Louisiana on June 13, 1852.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="214" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/711/images/gus550_small.jpg" style="float: left" width="170">They 
		made their way North in the next few years. Of the seven children from 
		the union of Johann Loehr and Frederika Knabner listed in the 1880 
		Census, Gus was the fourth. The oldest is Pauline aged 22 in 1880, and 
		shown as &quot;born in Illinois&quot; as were all the other children. This 
		suggests that the Loehrs arrived in Illinois before 1858 and settled 
		there.<br><br><br>In Carlinville, the Loehrs set up a general store, 
		while the children went to local schools. Gus's two older brothers, 
		Adolph and Theodore both worked locally as clerks. In Masonic records, 
		Gustave&nbsp;Loehr is shown as a&nbsp;'jeweler'&nbsp;on one document and as a 
		'promoter' and also as a 'mining engineer in some of Paul Harris' 
		writing. In 1886 at the age of 22, he became a freemason, but only ten 
		years later in 1896, he was suspended for non-payment of dues. <br><br>
		However, after a further seven years he was reinstated and remained a 
		mason until his death on May 23, 1918.<br><br>Gus Loehr Bio from &quot;The 
		Book of Chicagoans, a Biographical Dictionary of Leading Living Men of 
		the City of Chicago&quot; published in 1905 by A. N. Marquis &amp; Company (the 
		publisher of &quot;Who's Who in America)<br><br>

		was at Gus's office in the Unity Building on Dearborn Street, Chicago, 
		that on the night of February 23, 1905, the meeting took place which led 
		to the formation of the first Rotary club. Silvester<br><br>Schiele and 
		Paul had dined together at an Italian restaurant on Chicago's near north 
		side. Gus, by prearrangement, had invited a personal friend of his, 
		Hiram Shorey, a merchant tailor in the Loop.<br><br>Paul Harris 
		wrote about him that<br><br>&quot;<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/711/story.htm#There">Gustave's 		</a>personality challenged attention. His was a rare combination, the 
		good in him easily outweighing the bad. He was a stormy petrel, 
		vehement, impetuous, imperative, domineering, in one breath; then calm, 
		docile, and lovable in the next. He was always thought compelling; his 
		words were spoken with lightning like rapidity, and with such force that 
		men frequently stopped in the street to look at him. His educational 
		advantages had been limited, but his English was classical. Where he 
		found the vocabulary with which to give his furious thoughts expression, 
		was a quandary. Gus' membership was of brief duration.<br><br>The 
		feverish ups and downs of business resulted first in his resignation 
		from membership, and a few years later in his death.<br><br>Requiescat 
		in pace. Dear Gus, you rested little while here.&quot;<br><br>Gus Loehr died 
		suddenly in Chicago on May 23 1918 at the age of 53 when running to 
		catch a train. He was buried in the family home of Carlinville.<br><br>

		Forgotten Founder<br><br>The fourth man was a mining engineer named 
		Gustave Loehr. He was the host of that first meeting, as his three 
		friends met in his small downtown office on that cold night. Like 
		Shorey, Loehr spent little time with the club; he is known to have 
		attended only the first three meetings before resigning due to his 
		business interests. Only a few years later, as Rotary was enjoying 
		explosive growth, Loehr suffered a sudden death.
