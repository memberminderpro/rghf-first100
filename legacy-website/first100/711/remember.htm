		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">PDG Norman F. Kloker was President 
		of Rotary Club One (ROTARY/One) 1985-86, Governor of Rotary District 
		6450 1989-90, Chairman of RI’s 75th Anniversary Convention Landmark 
		Committee, and was Co-Founder of the Paul Harris 711 Club of which he is 
		Past President and Life Director. Also a director of the Paul Harris 
		Memorial Committee, Norm was the Founding Chairman of Rotary Heritage 
		and History International Fellowship, and he has been recognized by the 
		Rotary Heritage and History Hall of Fame for his more than 60 years of 
		service to Rotary.<br>
		<br>Preceding and relevant to the organization of the Rotary Heritage 
		and History International Fellowship, there were two committees, both 
		dedicated to the conservation and preservation of a historical site, the 
		place where Rotary was born on February 23, 1905. The first committee to 
		be organized was the Landmark Committee and later The Paul Harris 711 
		Club.<br><br>The Landmark Committee was a subcommittee of the Chicago 
		Host Clubs Committee for the 75th Anniversary Rotary Convention. It was 
		organized to function before the Convention under the direction of 
		Norman F. Kloker and these additional ROTARY/One members: Virgil 
		Peterson, John Nordberg, Norman A. Parker, Les Christensen, Mitchell P. 
		Davis, Jack O. Hedrick, Wilson Connell, John Sohl, William B. Weiss, 
		Arthur R. Rodstrom, Inar C. Hillman, and Horace C. Moses, Jr.<br><br>The 
		mission of the Landmark Committee was to offer Rotarians and their 
		families, from all over the world, the opportunity to visit the 
		birthplace of Rotary when they came to Chicago to attend the Rotary 
		International Convention in 1980.<br><br>The responsibility of the 
		Landmark Committee was to research the likely 1905 appearance of Room 
		711 in the Unity Building located at 127 North Dearborn Street in 
		Chicago, Illinois USA and to reconstruct interior walls, woodwork, 
		ceiling and furnish it as if it was again the 1905 office of Gustavus E. 
		Loehr. Room 711 was the place where Paul P. Harris, a lawyer, first 
		presented his idea of a businessmen’s club to three friends: Mining 
		Engineer Gustavus E. Loehr, Coal Dealer Silvester Schiele, and Tailor 
		Hiram Shorey. The idea that became known as Rotary.<br><br>Room 711 was 
		leased effective January 1, 1980 with restoration to be completed by 
		February 23, 1980, the anniversary day of the founding of Rotary. 
		Attending the opening of the completely reconstructed room was: Ruby 
		Carnahan, widow of 1906 ROTARY/One member and star of an audiovisual 
		presentation about the heritage and history of Rotary. <br><br>Rotarians 
		from Des Moines, Iowa area (the University of Iowa Law School is Paul 
		Harris’ alma mater), from the Racine, Wisconsin area (birthplace of Paul 
		Harris), from the greater Chicago area including Evanston, Illinois, 
		site of the Rotary International Headquarters. Personnel from R.I. 
		Included: Past General Secretary Harry A. Stewart , then current General 
		Secretary Herbert A. Pigman, and many District Governors. R. I. 
		President Jim Bomar and many incumbent Directors were unable to be 
		present February 23 but visited the site prior to the dedication. At a 
		luncheon following the dedication, Ruby Carnahan spoke warmly of the 
		early days of Rotary and in a personal audiovisual presentation. This 
		multi-projector slide presentation was also projected daily, on a large 
		screen, at the McCormick Place Convention Hall. During the convention 
		this attracted nearly 5000 Rotarians and guests to visit Room 711.<br>
		<br>After the 1980 international convention the Host Clubs Landmark 
		Committee no longer had funds to continue maintaining Room 711, this 
		special place in Rotary Global History. Therefore on November 15, 1983 
		the following ROTARY/One members and their wives furnished the seed 
		money and assumed the responsibility of renting and maintaining Room 711 
		and organized the Paul Harris 711 Club: Mr. &amp; Mrs. Max S. Bloom, Mr. &amp; 
		Mrs. Donald W. Bruechett, Mr. &amp; Mrs. L. N. Christensen, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Jack 
		H. Cornelius, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Gordon E. Crofoot, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Anthony A. 
		Digrazia, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Marvin Gordon, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Norman F. Kloker, Mr. &amp; 
		Mrs. Rochard S. Lopara, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Wayne Maxwell, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Horace C. 
		Moses, Jr., Mr. &amp; Mrs. Norman A. Parker, Mr. &amp; Mrs. John Sohl, Mr. &amp; 
		Mrs. Anthony J. Rudis, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Ralph A. Sello.<br><br>The mission of 
		the Paul Harris 711 Club (Foundation) was to obtain the funds necessary 
		to rent and maintain Room 711, the place where Rotary was born, and 
		later to move Room 711.<br><br>After several years of receiving funds 
		and greeting Rotarians from around the world the Paul Harris 711 Club 
		was facing the fact that the city of Chicago was about to demolish the 
		Unity Building. <br><br>Locating a place to rebuild Room 711 was 
		unsuccessful. Before demolition began the 711 Club arranged to remove 
		all of the marble entrance, glass, woodwork, and some of the furniture 
		and put it in storage. Gus Loehr’s desk, a file and some of the pictures 
		from the walls were moved into the office of the Rotary Club of 
		Chicago—New Chicago, located in the Midland Building, near the building 
		being demolished and near the club’s meeting place.<br><br>After their 
		meeting and whenever called upon, New Chicago Club members escorted 
		visiting Rotarians to their club office to see the Mining Engineer’s 
		desk. After considerable time spent searching for an appropriate space 
		to rebuild Room 711 and move the furniture, the Board of Directors of 
		Rotary International agreed to furnish space for the 711 Club to 
		reconstruct Room 711 at One Rotary Center.<br><br>The room originally 
		preserved and remodeled by the Landmark Committee, later maintained and 
		reconstructed by the 711 Club, was then made available to more Rotarians 
		than ever before. RI President Bill Huntley cut the ribbon at 
		rededication ceremonies 29 October 1994. Paul Harris 711 Club Past 
		President Norm Kloker presented Huntley with a replica of the original 
		key to Room 711.<br><br>President Huntley told the group, “There can 
		never be another occasion such as this in Rotary Global History, to 
		rededicate this room. We can applaud the vision of the members of the 
		711 Club who had this idea of preservation. It is with great pleasure 
		that I, as President of Rotary International and on behalf of all 
		Rotarians, accept the care and maintenance responsibility from the 711 
		Club — and I have the key to open it for you all.”<br><br>Throughout the 
		1997-98 Rotary year, directors of the Paul Harris 711 Club and directors 
		of the Memorial Committee, another Chicago-based preservation 
		organization, discussed the creation of an organization that would 
		recognize all Rotary historical sites throughout the world. They decided 
		that it would be effective if it were a Fellowship of Rotarians 
		dedicated to the conservation, preservation and sharing of Rotary 
		heritage and history.<br><br>Fifty seven Rotarians from the 711 Club and 
		the Memorial Committee held a meeting during the 1988 RI Convention in 
		Philadelphia resulting in establishment of the Rotary Heritage and 
		History International Fellowship with the 711 Club and the Memorial 
		Committee as affiliate members of the fellowship. The 57 Rotarians 
		became the first individual members of the fellowship. The Memorial 
		Committee is custodian of the burial sites of Rotary founder Harris and 
		first club president Schiele and the Monument and 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/index.php/rotary-founder/ph-memorial">Presidential Walkway</a> 
		they constructed at Mount Hope Cemetery.<br><br>The mission of Heritage 
		and History International Fellowship is to enjoy fellowship with 
		Rotarians who are dedicated to the conservation, preservation and 
		sharing of Rotary heritage and history.<br><br>The first issue of the 
		fellowship’s publication Share Rotary Heritage and History was issued 
		May 1989. RHHIF has published at least one issue per year since that 
		time. Most issues were edited and published by RHHIF Director Stanley T. 
		Tulak. Having served as Editor for his Rotary Club of Madison Heights, 
		Michigan, Stan was an experienced editor and publisher. A Rotarian since 
		1957, he had 40 years perfect attendance. He served as president of his 
		club and governor of his district. Stan received a Doctor of Dental 
		Surgery degree in 1957 and practiced dentistry in Madison Heights until 
		1964 when he moved his practice to nearby Warren, Michigan where he 
		practiced until his retirement in 1994.<br><br>July 29, 1996 was the 
		first annual meeting of the fellowship’s charter directors other than at 
		RI conventions. It was held at One Rotary Center in Evanston. RHHIF 
		original directors attending that meeting were: Japan Branch Manager 
		Tadao Tomiyama, Advisory member Wilmon White, Korea Branch Manager Hyun 
		Bang, Stanley Tulak, Ryoichi Takeyama, Donald Knapp and Founder/Director 
		Norman F. Kloker. Anthony Rudis, Robert Lecicrone, and Mexico Branch 
		Manager Jose Alfredo Sepulveda were absent.<br><br>The RHHIF Hall of 
		Fame was established to recognize RHHIF members who have served Rotary 
		for 50 years or more. By December 1997, over 150 Rotarians had been 
		recognized. In July 1998 RHHIF member Mike Gallagher turned 98 years of 
		age and had spent 74 years as a Rotarian. A past governor of D-5390 and 
		past president of the Billings Montana Rotary Club, Mike was believed to 
		hold the Rotary longevity record for longest continuous membership. A 
		Paul Harris Fellow, Mike had been a Charter Member of Detroit Lakes, 
		Minnesota, in 1922.<br><br>In 1992 RHHIF created eight 40” x 50” 
		displays for use in convention exhibits. These displays included 
		photographs and information concerning: the Racine Wisconsin birthplace 
		of Paul Harris and his early life in Waterford, Vermont including the 
		little red school house he attended, the Chicago house he and his wife 
		Jean called “Comely Bank,” the history of Room 711, the history of the 
		Rotary Foundation and its founder, 1916 International President Arch 
		Klumpf, Rotary-on-Postage-Stamps, and the official framed register of 
		RHHIF’s Hall of Fame. This display was first exhibited at the 1992 RI 
		Convention in Orlando, Florida, USA.<br><br>Further information about 
		this fellowship appears in Rotarian magazines dated: 1985, 1988, 1989, 
		1990, 1991, 1995 and 1996.<br><br>Also read &quot;<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/ruggles/remember.htm">The Harry Ruggles I Knew&quot;
