				<span class="style12"><span class="style13">Ron was born in Arkansas, USA	but settled in Louisiana before 
	graduate study at Louisiana State and Ohio State Universities.</span><br class="style13">
				<br><span class="style13">He was called after one year to return to his alma mater and appointed 
	at SLU near New Orleans for 35 years as Music Professor, and later, GM for 
	KSLU Public Radio.</span><br class="style13"><br class="style13">
				<span class="style13">His tenure in Rotary began in 1986 in Hammond, Louisiana. His father was a Rotarian, and now his son; three generations in Rotary.</span><br class="style13">
	<br class="style13"><span class="style13">Following the normal progression as Secretary and VP, Ron	became 
	President in 1995 for the 84 member Hammond, Louisiana club, serving as GSE 
	Team Leader from District 6840 to District 1050, Assistant Governor for two 
	terms, Outstanding Rotarian in 1998, and named Outstanding AG in 1999.<br></span><br class="style13">
				<span class="style13">Ron was awarded a Visiting Rotary Professorship to the University of the

				Major Donors in 2009.<br></span><br class="style13">

				anniversary list, stalwart and general ROTI sage since he joined 
				ROTI in 1998.<br>&nbsp;</span><br class="style13">
				<span class="style13">During that time his efforts at District events raised the ROTI

	to have the highest number of ROTI members in the world.</span><br class="style13">
	<br class="style13"><span class="style13">Travels have taken him to twenty five of the fifty US states.<br></span><br class="style13">
				<span class="style13">International travels as a Malone Fellow, academician, and musician, have taken 
	him to twenty-two countries during which he sought out the venues of Rotary clubs 
	and was able to attend Rotary meetings in fourteen of them.</span><br class="style13">
				<span class="style13">Ron was a frequent visitor to Honduras and organized “Horns for Honduras” 
	and collected used band instruments for Honduras schools.<br></span><br class="style13">
				<span class="style13">That led to a request from El Salvador to survey the needs of the schools 
	in San Salvador a year later.</span><br class="style13">
				<span class="style13">In 1999 he assisted with relief efforts after Hurricane Mitch.</span><br class="style13">
				<br class="style13">
				<span class="style13">Ron said that his favorite ROTI moments was when Gloria and he 
	presented the ROTIan of the Year award to Mingo in Malaysia; developing 
	matching grants with D6060, D1020, D6980, and attending RI Conventions in 
	Chicago, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, Montreal, and New Orleans.<br></span><br class="style13">
				<span class="style13">Work in District 3790 has included DG Special Citation in 2002, 
	DGSR in 2003, GSE Chair in 2005-06 and 2008-09, Fellowship Chair 2008-09,

				&quot;Gives me something to do on Monday and Thursday&quot; he says.<br>
</span><br class="style13">

	Davao, Cebu, Bacolod, Iloilo, and Manila.</span><br class="style13">
	<br class="style13"><span class="style13">Ron and his wife have been named “The Dynamic Duo” in tribute to 
	their frequent seminars they give re Matching Grants, TRF, and using 
	computers to become better Rotarians. Ron was named Chief Photographer for the Philippine Rotary Magazine 
	in July of 2011.</span><br class="style13"><br class="style13">
				<span class="style13">Presently Ron is a Consultant at Angeles University where he directs 
	the Center for American Studies and also for radio DWAU-FM 104.1.&nbsp;He is also a columnist for the Central Luzon Business Week and P.R.O. 
	for CILA (Clark Investors and Locators Association). His professional 
	educational and musical background may be found at his personal web site.<br>
		<br>Ron learned about the 
				<a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/library/music/rotarywatch.htm" target="_blank">
				<strong>Rotary Watch</strong></a> program and the work being done by Albert 
				M.G. Gacia in coordinating the Philippine National Police Force 
				with Philippine Rotarians. After meeting with Albert he 
				introduced the program to District 3790. Ron was appointed 
				District Director and subsequently arranged the signing of 
				several agreements between the National Police and Rotary Clubs 
				and Districts, virtually increasing the effectiveness of the 
				Philippine Police by an additional 1,000+ volunteer surveillance 
				personnel.</span><br class="style13">
				<br>
	<br class="style13"><span class="style13"><strong><span class="style14">
				<a name="Gloria_Anacleto-Nethercutt">Gloria Anacleto-Nethercutt</a></span></strong> was born in Pasay City, Metro Manila, Philippines 
	and grew up in Makati City where she achieved her college 
				engineering<span class="style14"> </span> 
				degree 
	from FEATI U and MLQU, Manila.&nbsp;She was involved in the construction industry for 12 years before starting 
	a family business in leather-goods export and manufacturing - in Paranaque City, 
	sometime in 1986.&nbsp;The family moved the factory to Angeles City in 1995, which later on 
	became a permanent residence place for most of her siblings.<br></span><br class="style13">
				<span class="style13">Gloria first attended a Rotary meeting in Las Pinas, Metro Manila, 1994, to 
	collect her construction billing check from a client who was president then of 
	that club. It became a practice for a month or so until Gloria found herself 
	inducted as member, and later on doing the club weekly bulletin.&nbsp;Her brilliant work earned her an award as 
				outstanding Rotarian and 
	bulletin editor.&nbsp;After moving to Angeles City, Gloria, was invited by her sister May 
	to join the Rotary Club of Mabalacat.&nbsp;Again Gloria was asked to do the club weekly bulletin which was 
	adjudged as most outstanding in the district, an award that the club 
	consistently received year after year, among other recognitions in 
	community service.</span><br class="style13">
	<br class="style13"><span class="style13">Gloria was President of her club in 2003, and she asked her spouse Ron, 
	a veteran Rotarian, to be her Secretary. She was named District Outstanding President.&nbsp;Ron and Gloria met in Rotary in 1998.&nbsp;As members of the global fellowship 
				Rotarians On The Internet (ROTI), 
	they made Rotary work in their personal lives.&nbsp;When Ron was music professor at the University of the Philippines under 
	RI’s volunteer educational program, he and Gloria spent more time together and 
	later on tied the knot in 2000.</span><br class="style13">
				<br class="style13">
				<span class="style13">Because of their international connections, District 3790 assigned Gloria as 
				matching grant chair and Ron as GSE chair.&nbsp;Gloria kept the position for 3 years and assisted the clubs and the 
	district in more than $500,000 in humanitarian grants.</span><br class="style13">
				<span class="style13">Throughout the Philippines Gloria and Ron are known as “<strong>The Dynamic Duo</strong>” in 
	tribute to their frequent seminars on Matching Grants, TRF, and using computers 
	to become better Rotarians.&nbsp;At one district meeting when it was asked about appointing someone to 
	an important committee position, PDG Mar OCampo said, “appoint either Glo 
	or Ron, that way you get two.” Their combined enthusiasm in many different locations, convinced many 
	Rotarians to go outside the district and enjoy the fellowship of their 
	peers at international Rotary events.</span><br class="style13">
				<br class="style13">
				<span class="style13">In 2009 Ron and Glo became Major Donors to The Rotary Foundation; one 
	of the first non-DG or PDG couples to do so in District 3790.</span><br class="style13">
	<br class="style13"><span class="style13">Gloria’s work in District 3790 included DG Special Citations 
	2003-2010, TRF newsletter editor in 2003-04, DGSC 2004-2008, DGSR in 2008 
	and 2010, Permanent Fund chair 2010-11, PolioPlus chair 2011-12. She is presently the editor of &quot;the Breadbasket&quot;, a monthly newsletter 
	of the Rotarians On The Internet, a position she will hold until 2013. Gloria is a licensed real estate broker and uses her engineering 
	degree to integrate construction planning, urban space/interior layout, and 
	cost analyses to her consultancy work.<br><br>
				<strong> 
				<img height="166" src="images/ronngloria2.jpg" width="221" style="float: left">Jointly</strong>,&nbsp; Ron as the primary contact and Gloria as the district grants 
				coordinator, have been responsible for the following projects in the Philippines 
	which were made through ROTI or through persons at conventions, GSE, etc. The 
	Club sponsors are listed as below -<br>
	RC Longriddry of D 1020 Scotland;<br>
	RC  Sanford of D 6980  FL (USA) 3 grants (RY 2008-09  2009-10  2010-11);<br>
	RC Strongsville of D 3564 Ohio (USA);<br>

	The <strong>Bahay Bata Center</strong> in Angeles City, Philippines is a home for street kids of Angeles City which 
	also provides education, welfare, sports, medical and other facilities. 
	The home was created as a major project by the Rotary Club Clark Centennial under the guidance of its 
	Charter President Reynaldo Pineda.<br><br>
	The center was inaugurated on 25 July 2001 but struggled to provide 
				sufficient nutritious food to its children until Ron and Gloria 
				arranged the first of seven (7) Matching Grants which eliminated 
				the problem while also providing educational material and 
				computers. Many of the former &quot;street kids&quot; have moved on to 
				full time employment and attending college.&nbsp;<br><br>Ron 
				and Gloria are both presently members of the Rotary Club of Mabalacat,   D 3790,
Angeles City, Philippines.</span></td>
