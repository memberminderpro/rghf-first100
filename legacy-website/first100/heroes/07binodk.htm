				&nbsp;In the early 60s, Binod Khaitan was a member of the 
				<span class="style14">Jaycees</span> International<img height="21" src="images/jc.jpg" width="75">and after moving to New Delhi in the early 
				70s, he joined <span class="style14">Lions</span> International
				<img height="60" src="images/lions1.jpg" width="65" style="float: left">.<br>An interest in 
				Rotary began as a teenager when he attended several Rotary 
				Fellowship Meets, which took place at home. After joining 
				business in the early sixties, he accompanied his grandfather 
				and attended several Rotary weekly Tuesday meetings at Princes – 
				Grand Hotel. His home had offered home hospitality to several 
				foreign &amp; Indian Rotarians.<br><br>
				Returning again to Kolkata in the early 80s, he hoped to join his 
				Grandfather's Club - RC Calcutta known in India as &quot;Rotary number 1&quot; 
				but his classification as &quot;plywood manufacturer&quot; was unavailable.<br><br>
				He was invited to join the Rotary Club of Central Calcutta (RCCC) by President Mahesh Saharia in 1986 who 
				had invited him to a Rotary <span class="style14">Polio program</span> at Kala Kunj, Kolkata. 
				Mahesh left RCCC but in 1987, Girish Khaitan renewed the 
				invitation while Raju Rajgharia was the President.<br>
				<br>Upon joining Rotary, his aim was to help develop rural 
				West Bengal. However, when he was called to lead RCCC after PE 
				Ramesh Bahety developed cold feet and decided to resign from the 
				Board, his aim was delayed.<br>
				1989 – 90 was a period of turmoil in RCCC. His first task was "to 
				bring back sanity &amp; decorum in the Club!!"<br>
				As 1990-91 President he was successful and paved a way for the 
				future leaders to SERVE through RCCC.<br>
				During his presidency he developed three very good friends in Rtn 
				K.Chandramohan (Mohan) a grass-roots, service oriented Rotarian; 
				Rtn Prabhat Rohatgi, then President of Rotary No.1, a family friend; 
				and RCCC President Elect Rtn Shekhar Mehta.<br>
				<br>He relates his most memorable program as president of 
				RCCC as being the "International Inter District Preserve Planet 
				Earth Seminar", at the Kolkata Ice Skating Rink.<br>
				&quot;We had a very big contingent, Rotarians with their 
				families from Bangladesh and the participation of Interact, 
				Rotaract and Rotarians was unexpected &amp; over whelming.<br>
				<img height="100" src="images/rppe.jpg" width="100" style="float: left">The very colorful Road March with &quot;Preserve Planet Earth&quot; 
				messages &amp; picture posters painted by Interactors, colorful 
				printed balloons, colorful satin silk flags, banners appropriately 
				printed and two Bands.<br>

				reached the Ice Skating Rink, the end was still at Ballygunge 
				Phari!!"<br>
	<br>&nbsp;While attending a LIMB Camp at Birlapur jointly organized by RCCC 
	and RC Budge Budge in December 1991, Mohan requested Binod, Raju and Shekhar 
	to consider sponsoring a Rotary Club at Baghati, Hooghly where a visit to 
	the village had been planned.<br>
	Raju and many other RCC Leaders realised that the village could only be 
	accessed after a walk of two kilometers on a narrow path and doubt of 
	the ability to form the club arose.<br>
	Binod however, accepted the challenge. The village lacked rudimentary 
	facilities such as proper road access, clean tube well drinking water, 
	toilets, school etc. There were hardly any fruit trees and people 
	sustained themselves with a single Khariff paddy crop, which many a time 
	was washed away due to excess rain.<br>&nbsp;<a href="images/baghati1.jpg"><img class="style15" height="74" src="images/baghati1_small.jpg" width="100" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/baghati1.jpg" style="float: left"></a>Within one year of entering 
	the village in May 1994, four tube wells&nbsp; were installed for safe drinking 
	water and toilets were constructed after educating the villagers.<br><br>
				<br><br>
	Agriculture Training to cultivate appropriate high paddy seeds &amp;hybrid 
	vegetables during winter, planting fruit trees, training to 
				<a href="images/baghati2.jpg">
				<img class="style15" height="65" src="images/baghati2_small.jpg" width="100" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/baghati2.jpg" style="float: left"></a>effectively 
	use ponds for pesiculture and poultry farming were all introduced. <br>
	Women were given training in sewing, knitting, mushroom cultivation and 
	bamboo craft.<br>
	The dilapidated mud school was replaced with a pucca two Room school and 
	several children activities (i.e. sports, games, singing &amp; drawing 
	competitions etc.) were organized.<br>
	Baghati saw a revolutionary economic living standard improvement and as 
	a result of Binod's team, RC Baghati was declared the Districts best club 
	in 1993 -94 &amp; again in 1994-95!<br>
	<br>RCCC ventured to start another two Rotary Clubs – Dakshindihi & 
	Bhanderhati in Hooghly where similar developmental activities and projects 
	were taken up at these clubs with addition financial support through TRF 
	Matching Grants.<br>
	<br>While President, Binod had dreamt of creating ROTARY SIKHSHA KENDRA 
	(RSK) in his own Club’s School building.<br>
	The project was started in a hired room at Vishnupur by Raju. However, 
	the president of the club, for want of funds, intended to abandon the 
	project. Rtn Binod arranged funding and kept the project going.<br>
	Subsequently, land was located and RCCC Planned a Lottery to raise about 
	Rs Nine Lakhs (Rs900,500). The Lottery, took place in 1991-92 when Shekhar 
	was President and Rs600,500 was raised.<br>
	The land which had been offered at a very low cost, went into difficulty - 
	the West Bengal Govt issued acquisition orders for widening Diamond 
	Harbour Road. This was ultimately sorted out and thanks to Subhahsh 
	Kankaria & his son Sandeep, the school building was a reality within a few 
	months of it’s foundation being laid by RI President Robert Bath.<br>
				<a href="images/rsk.jpg">
				<img class="style15" height="83" src="images/rsk_small.jpg" width="100" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/rsk.jpg" style="float: left"></a>RSK remains the flag ship project of RCCC! <br>
	<br>During the year 1994-95, Rtn Binod took the opportunity to spread 
	amongst Clubs & Rotarians the <span class="style14">Grant Programs</span> of TRF.<br>
	As Dist Chair TRF Grants he learnt about the 3H Grant and the possibilities 
	of bigger projects.<br>
	RCCC had contributed a substantial sum for the purchase of land for the 
	District Hospital Project – EASTERN INDIA ROTARY WELFARE TRUST (EIRWT) and 
	had committed to set up a M & CH Center in a portion of the 3 Acre plot at 
	Salt Lake Sector V, that had been allotted to the Trust by the Govt. of West 
	Bengal.<br>
	Despite some pessimism among several Trustees and with encouragement from 
	Mohan & Prabhat, he convinced PDG Amiya Shankar Gupta to apply for a TRF 3H 
	Grant for a Diabetic Hospital. With further encouragement, guidance and 
	help from PDG (Kitchluda) Iftekharul Alam of RID 3280, RCCC found an 
	International Partner – RID 6380 via the then District Governor - Terry 
	Youlton. Youlton was very interested in joining hands, as his daughter died due to 
	diabetes.<br>
	It was an unforgettable experience at the Foundation Laying ceremony of 
	the Hospital and regular visits to the site during construction. 
	Several meetings & functions were organized for fund raising. 
	Thanks to the first cheque from PP Dr R S Majumdar, the EIRWT was able to 
	generate funds for the foundation & ground floor of the first building. 
	The foundation & the ground floor of 9,000 sq.ft. estimated to cost about 
	one crore (Rs10 million) was completed and the hospital equipped through the TRF 3H grant 
	was started as a Diagnostic Center.<br>
	RCCC contributed another Rs 18 lakhs (Rs1.8 million) for the floor area to 
	accommodate the Pathology Lab. The Hospital started it’s activities from 
	January 2001. Later the same year EIRWT joined hand with Asia Heart 
	Foundation (AHF) to manage the Hospital. In 2003 a tripartite agreement 
	was signed with EIRWT, AHF & Shankra Nethralya. The hospital was converted 
	into a ‘State of Art’ Eye Hospital – "Rotary Narayan Sankara Nethralaya".<br>
				<img height="163" src="images/rnn.jpg" width="250" style="float: left">The hospital grew. Three more floors were added through donations collected 
	by AHF. The Hospital has a covered area of 40,000 sft. Unfortunately, the 
	agreement was determined and thus EIRWT decided to enter into another very 
	favorable agreement with AHF. The Name of the Hospital now is "ROTARY NARAYAN 
	NETHRALAYA". Rtn Binod reflects that "to visit the Hospital, the only permanent 
	project of RID 3291, makes me feel really very proud to be a ROTARIAN of RID 
	3291!"<br>
	<br>  &nbsp;<span class="style14">Experience as District Secretary </span>-<br>
	"With Prabhat leading the District, we were able to involve most of the 
	Clubs into TRF Grant Projects with over 120 TRF Matching Grant Projects.<img height="151" src="images/nagar1.jpg" width="202" style="float: right"><br>
	The saga of TRF Projects continued the following year under the dynamic 
	leadership of Shekhar. The final nod of the TRF for the biggest ever 3H 
	Grant - US$ 530,000 saw Shekhar’s dream <span class="style14">ROTARY</span>
				<span class="style14">NAGAR</span> Project
				come true.<br>
	It was indeed a very sentimental and satisfying occasion to receive a call 
	at 12.15 in the night, from our International Contact Person and a great 
	friend PDG Ton Ewen of RID 7010 Canada.<br>
	<br>Binod acknowledged Ravi Sehgal who in 2001-02 appointed him as DICO – 
				<span class="style14">District Internet Communication Officer & Webmaster</span>. "Rotary gave me this 
	opportunity to learn Computers & Websites, which has come to very good 
	stead in day to day life."<br>
	<br>"The challenge of introducing <span class="style14">ROTARY LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE
				</span>(RLI) during 
	2002-03 by Governor Amitava Mookerjee, gave me a fresh insight to face the 
	mirth and mocking of several Past Governors. RLI today is in 31 Districts 
	of Rotary South Asia Zone. What a wonderful program to convert RINOs – 
	Rotarians in Name Only into knowledgeable Rotarians who appreciate the 
	meaning of Rotary FELLOWSHIP & SERVICE towards fulfilling RI’s aim of a 
	World with UNDERSTANDING, GOODWILL & PEACE."<br>
	<br>"The <span class="style14">TSUNAMI</span> disaster on 26th December 2004, gave me an unforgettable 
	opportunity and experience of true Rotary SERVICE. An SMS from Shekhar set 
	the ball rolling of collecting, sorting out, packing, transporting and 
	distributing relief material to those who lost everything and even their 
	close dear ones at Andaman & Nicobar Islands.<br>
	The traumatic scenes at Port Blair gave me another angle of real service 
	and it’s meaning. The sense 
				<img height="139" src="images/pblair.jpg" width="186" style="float: left">of satisfaction of being able to be of help & 
	use in such trying conditions. The several visits to Port Blair and to be 
	a part of REHABILITATION activity gave more satisfaction unfounded. 
	Unexpected contributions flowed both locally & world over. <br>
	Our efforts made it possible to build 500 Low Cost Shelters at Little 
	Andaman, Two Children’s Hostels and a Medical Center with latest diagnostic 
	facilities & telemedicine at Port Blair.<br>
	<br>My contact with a great friend - PP Samar Das of RC Guildford RID 1250 has 
	become a commitment to Rotary’s Preventable Blindness Projects.<br>
	The most satisfying project, with which I am still closely connected, is the 
	"Rotary Hooghly Eye 
				<img height="194" src="images/blind.jpg" width="259" style="float: left">Hospital". I am proud to be a part of RID 3291 efforts, 
	which now has seven (7) Rotary Eye Hospitals and several other Eye 
	Hospitals where equipment was provided through TRF M/G Projects.<br>
	It was District 3290’s Centennial aim to achieve 10,000 Intra Ocular Lens 
	Implant surgeries to give LIGHT to those who unfortunately suffer.<br>
	However, I am happy that currently the <span class="style14">Rotary Hospitals</span> give LIGHT to over 
	15,000 people every year and the target is to achieve 50,000 IOLs!<br>
	<br>Experiences & memories in organizing several Rotary 
				<span class="style14">District and Zone 
	events</span> have given me a lot of Rotary insight, lasting wonderful memories 
	and friends, whom I cherish & preserve.<br>
	These events have been hard work but a saga of frustrating satisfaction to 
	be a Rotarian.<br>
	<br>The experience of hosting Rotarians form various parts of the earth & 
				<span class="style14">GSE Teams</span> at HOME is a fantastic way to make lasting International friends 
	the world over. Though it can be a time consuming effort, but pays great 
	dividends towards making life long friends and insight & knowledge of 
	people, values, culture & religions around the world.<br>
	<br>Binod attended <span class="style14">Rotary Conventions</span> held at Singapore, San Antonio, 
	Chicago, Copenhagen & Birmingham. He reflected "I look forward to attend 
	the Convention at New Orleans. The true INTERNATIONALITY OF ROTARY can 
	only be appreciated, understood, seen and believed by attending a Convention.<br>
	Having integrated these travels with opportunities to visit Clubs around 
	the world and HOME STAYs with my several International Rotarian friends has 
	made me a different human being with tolerance and appreciation of different 
	living, values, culture & thoughts.<br>
	In addition, it would NOT have been possible for Chandrakala & myself to see 
	so much of this beautiful planet earth if it was NOT for Rotary!"<br>
	<br>Rotarian Binod Khaitan quotes William Arthur Ward - "Real optimism is aware of problems but 
	recognizes solutions; knows about difficulties but believes they can be 
	overcome; sees the negatives, but accentuates the positives; is exposed to 
	the worst but expects the best; has reason to complain, but chooses to 
	smile."<br>
