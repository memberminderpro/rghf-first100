		was a loan to start a sewing business that enabled her to feed her 
		children. To North Koreans, it was an ambulance that equipped a hospital 
		to be able to take care of them. To thousands of college students in 
		almost every country on earth, it was the chance to study abroad, with 
		all expenses paid, and learn their educational specialty up close and 
		personal.<br><br>Ask anyone who has been touched by The Rotary

		<img class="auto-style26" src="/first100/foundation/endowment/images/klumph.gif" style="float: left">The Rotary Foundation was born as 
		an endowment fund in 1917, the brainchild of RI President Arch C. 
		Klumph. It was reborn 12 years later in the form we know today, The 
		Rotary Foundation of Rotary international. However, it wouldn't be until 
		after the passing of Paul P. Harris in 1947 that TRF would reach the 
		financial health and world importance that it enjoys today. Technically 
		speaking, it is a not-for-profit corporation that supports the efforts 
		of Rotary International to achieve world understanding and peace through 
		international humanitarian, educational, and cultural exchange programs. 
		It is supported solely by voluntary contributions from Rotarians and 
		friends of the Foundation who share its vision of a better world.<br>
		<br>Its expenses are borne solely by the interest earned on its 
		contributions over a three year period. As an endowment fund for Rotary 
		&quot;to do good in the world,&quot; its initial contribution was US $26.50 in 
		1918. When it became The Rotary Foundation in 1928, it had a value of US 
		$5,739.07. In the most recent year that we have complete figures, the 
		Foundation had more than US $73 million contributed in 2000-01. But, 
		that's not what The Rotary Foundation is all about. Its event-filled 85 
		years has been a story of Rotarians learning the value of service to 
		humanity, and the citizens of the earth benefiting from that service.<br><br>The Humanitarian Programs of the 
		foundation help fuel international Rotary projects to improve the 
		quality of life, providing health care, clean water, food, education, 
		and other essential needs primarily in the developing world.<br><br>A 
		major Humanitarian Program is PolioPlus, which seeks to eradicate the 
		polio virus worldwide by Rotary's 100th birthday in 2005. Through its 
		Educational Programs, the Foundation provides funding for some 1,200 
		students to study abroad each year. Grants are also awarded to 
		university teachers to teach in developing countries and for exchanges 
		of business and professional people. Even its former participants in the 
		Foundation's programs can continue their affiliation with Rotary as 
		Foundation Alumni.<br><br>In his 1917 address, RI President Arch 
		C. Klumph said:<br><br>&quot;We have called the attention of the organization 
		this year to the possibility of a future endowment fund for Rotary. 
		Carrying on, as we are, a miscellaneous community service, it seems 
		eminently proper that we should accept endowments for the purpose of 
		doing good in the world, in charitable, educational or other avenues of 
		community progress; or such funds could be well used for extension work. 
		I know of no more commendable use for the vast millions possessed by men 
		in this country than that certain sums might be endowed to Rotary for 
		the purpose of establishing Rotary clubs in all nations of the world&quot;.<br>
		<br>From the Proceedings of the Eighth Annual Rotary Convention in 
		Atlanta, 1917, page 19: &quot;Arch ... has always been firm in the belief 
		that his persistence would eventually be rewarded, that it would not 
		always be necessary for him to walk alone. Long after Arch's journey is 
		ended other men will be following the trail he has been blazing 
		throughout the years.&quot; <br><br>Paul P. Harris, Page 237 &quot;This Rotarian Age&quot; 1935.</td>
