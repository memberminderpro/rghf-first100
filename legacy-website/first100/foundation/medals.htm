		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19" colspan="4">The most 		<a href="medals.htm#important" name="important">important</a> step to promote 
		voluntary giving to The Rotary Foundation occurred in January, 1957, 
		when the Paul Harris Fellow recognition was established and bestowed to 
		those who showed appreciation for and encourage substantial 
		contributions to what was then the Foundation's only program, Rotary 
		Foundation Fellowships for Advanced Study, the precursor to 
		Ambassadorial Scholarships. Early Paul Harris Fellows received a 
		certificate of recognition with three categories of distinction based on 
		cumulative giving: Individual PHF ($1000), Honorary Fellow ($500-1000), 
		Memorial Contributor, ($100-300). The first Paul Harris Fellows include 
		1937-38 RI Director Allison G. Brush and longtime RI Treasurer Rufus F. 
		Chapin, both for donations they made in 1946. Mrs. Adan Vargas was the 
		first woman to receive the recognition, for a gift made in 1953. Mrs. 
		Harry L. Jones was the second, and one of only five people recognized 
		for contributions made in 1957. In January 1958, a new form of 
		recognition of Sustaining Contributor for minimum annual contributions 
		of $100 was authorized. The Sustaining Contributor recognition was in 
		the form of a pocket card. <br><br>Under the direction of then-past 
		Foundation Trustee Kyozo Yuasa, the noted metal artist, Fiju Tsuda, of 
		Japan was commissioned to create the PHF recognition medallion in 1968. 
		The medallion was designed, sculpted and struck in Ginza, Tokyo and 
		unveiled at the 1969 Rotary International Convention in Honolulu. At a 
		special Foundation Trustee Convention breakfast, the bronze medallion 
		suspended from a triangular blue and gold ribbon was presented to 46 
		attendees of the then existing 300 Paul Harris Fellows, including Mrs. 
		Coyles Collins who was the first woman recipient of a Paul Harris Fellow 
		medallion. At an unknown later date, this first version of the Medallion 
		was accompanied by a blue velvet lapel pin adorned with a small gold 
		likeness of Paul Harris, a specially-commissioned, blue-colored folding 
		keepsake box designed and manufactured by Wako Company of Ginza, Japan, 
		and a certificate.<br><br>In a near simultaneous effort to promote 
		charitable giving to The Rotary Foundation in 1968, the Paul Harris 
		Sustaining Member (PHSM) replaced the Sustaining Contributor 
		distinction. More than just a nomenclature change, PHSM was earned by 
		donating a minimum of $100 with the stated intention of becoming a Paul 
		Harris Fellow by accumulating a donation total of $1,000. In November 
		1998, The Foundations' Trustees clarified the definition of Sustaining 
		Members and renamed them Rotary Foundation Sustaining Members (RFSM). 
		Beginning in 2004-2005, Rotarians who give $100 or more to the Annual 
		Programs Fund automatically become Rotary Foundation Sustaining Members.<br>
		<br>The original triangular-shaped ribbon with suspended medallion was 
		succeeded by a second version - a traditionally-shaped medal ribbon that 
		was provided in a blue velvet presentation box along with a new blue 
		enamel and bronze lapel pin. At an unknown date, a blue and gold 
		neckwear ribbon was attached to this second version so that the 
		medallion could either be worn pinned to the individual or freely 
		adorned around the neck.<br><br>The neckwear ribbon came in two 
		variants; one in which the ribbon gathered at one point by a small metal 
		ring to be attached to the medallion and the other which was pre-sewn at 
		the point of medallion attachment so that the metal ring did not move 
		and made a preformed v-shape to lie flat on the chest. At an unknown 
		point in time, the traditionally-shaped medal ribbon was discontinued 
		leaving the medallion to be suspended by the neckwear ribbon only.<br>
		<br>The blue enamel and bronze lapel pin and blue velvet presentation 
		case continued to be part of this neckwear only version of recognition 
		along with a certificate. Several variants of ribbon color and width 
		exist: a one or two inch wide ribbon of blue/gold, solid blue, 
		blue/yellow colors. Rotarians have a tradition of supporting the 
		Foundation by honoring others. Ida LeTulle Taylor became a Paul Harris 
		Fellow in 1978 when her husband, then-District Governor Vann Taylor, 
		made a donation in her name in honor of their 34th wedding anniversary.<br>
		<br>The gift also made her the 25,000th Paul Harris Fellow. 
		Additionally, At the International Assembly in 1979, then-RI 
		President-elect James Bomar challenged each Rotary club to make one 
		non-Rotarian a Paul Harris Fellow. Although women were not admitted to 
		Rotary International membership until 1987, they were permitted to 
		attend meetings, give speeches and presentation, and receive awards. 
		Women relatives of Rotary members could form their own associations and 
		were authorized to wear the Rotary lapel pin.<br><br>At sometime before 
		1983, a women's version of the Paul Harris Fellow recognition was 
		authorized and produced. Both non-Rotarian women and women accepted into 
		Rotary International Membership in 1987 received this woman's version. 
		The medallion was suspended on a faux gold 22-inch chain and a new 
		women's lapel pin resembling a shiny gold brooch that was much larger 
		than the men's version was presented in a maroon velvet presentation 
		case. Thus, for a period of time until 1997, two gender-specific Paul 
		Harris Fellow recognitions coexisted. <br><br>Introduced in 1984, the 
		blue-stone Multiple Paul Harris Fellow pin recognizes additional 
		donations by existing Paul Harris Fellows. Each stone represents an 
		additional US$1,000 donation, up to $5,000. Red-stone Multiple Paul 
		Harris Fellow pins were introduced in 1988 to bridge the gap between the 
		blue five-stone pin for Multiple Paul Harris Fellows and Major Donor 
		recognition. <br><br>In 1997, the Foundation Trustees standardized the 
		designs of the medallion and lapel pin and unveiled as the fourth 
		version a new unisex version of the Paul Harris Fellow. The large Paul 
		Harris Fellow medallion originally designed by Fiju Tsuda was replaced 
		by a smaller design of Paul Harris's likeness surrounded by a blue 
		enamel circle and an outer ring of faux gold emblazoned with wheat 
		design.<br><br>The new medallion was suspended by a one-inch blue/yellow 
		neckwear ribbon. Additionally, a new lapel pin that was identical to the 
		multiple Paul Harris pin developed in 1984 accompanied this unisex 
		version when presented in the blue velvet presentation case along with a 
		certificate. This version continues to today, except for the 2009 
		Foundation Trustees decision to only provide the lapel pin and 
		certificate as the Paul Harris Fellow recognition, discontinue the blue 
		velvet presentation case, and allow the blue/yellow neckwear ribbon and 
		medallion to be purchased directly from the Rotary Foundation at the 
		option of the recipient.<br><br>The number of Paul Harris Fellows 
		reached the one million mark in 2006 when thirty-four individuals (one 
		per RI Zone) were recognized with special plaque and certificate as the 
		one-millionth Paul Harris Fellow. RGHF member Lloyd T. Navarro, Jr.,
