					On early morning Christmas day, I sit here in the living 
					room with the lighted tree and all the wrapped presents 
					until others get up to begin the ritual of opening gifts. 
					This season I am more interested in giving than receiving. 
					We will see how that plays out. Christmas is a time where 
					Samantha becomes a child again with the excitement of the 
					season (and now she is a 31 year-old mother). She will pass 
					this joy to Erin I am sure, just as we passed it on to her. 
					Yule time is a magical season, much more than the presents 
					under the tree. It is the songs of Christmas, the atmosphere 
					of counting our blessings and everyone on the street saying, 
					“Merry Christmas.” Coming home is the best present we could 
					give ourselves. As one friend told me long ago, “After the 
					money is spent, you forget its amount.” The wonder of the 
					work in the new exhibit on December 19<sup>th</sup> begins 
					to fade. “What’s next?” is my mindset. I am beginning to 
					think of the spring exhibition, my final showing in Georgia. 
					How do I top what I did in December? I don’t but maybe Joe 
					and Friends will be a new experience as rich as the last (as 
					all my Georgian artist friends come together to say 
					goodbye). It should have wide public appeal and show the 
					variety and skill of what is happening in Georgia.&nbsp; That 
					will make three major projects for the spring: finalizing 
					the placement of the American Art Archive Collection, 
					creating the first playground in the inner city in Tbilisi, 
					and the “Joe and Friends” exhibition. That is plenty to keep 
					me occupied until we fly to Beijing in May and then home to 
					Texas.</p>

					We get a rare treat on Christmas afternoon, an encore 
					performance of the Concert for New York City. It is five and 
					a half hours of pure pleasure and tears. I do not like all 
					the music but no one can deny the wonder of the whole 
					experience of America coming together to mourn those who 
					died and celebrate freedom. It is hard to find the words to 
					say how I feel. There is pride in America, certainly, and 
					there is wonderment in how 
					quickly America rebounds from the terrorist attack. I think 
					that bin Laden thought that the structure of the nation 
					would crumble when the two towers did, but he is wrong. We 
					are only soft on the surface. The Rumanian columnist’s 
					article on America, sent to me from the Rumanian Embassy in 
					Tbilisi, sums up my feelings in his “Ode to America”. He 
					calls the five and a half hour concert “a celebration of 
					freedom and heroes”.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					Since that concert, I have been thinking about America’s 
					position in world affairs, particularly in light of 
					international terrorism. I know that bin Laden understood 
					that he was attacking a symbol of America’s wealth and 
					power, but what he might not have see is that America is a 
					system which does not depend on the leadership from the top 
					but the courage of all citizens when freedom is attacked. It 
					is the system which will survive, even when individuals die. 
					It does not make any difference in our policy if Gore had 
					beaten Bush for the Presidency. The job shapes the man 
					through our history as it does today. You can see that in 
					the faces of those who have been chosen to lead. They age 
					and gray in the decision-making position. In Georgia, if the 
					head man changes, the system changes. I also question bin 
					Laden’s decision to attack the World Trade Center because 
					the optimum word there is “world”. It is interesting to see 
					that all attacks since then have been on American Airlines 
					or the US Postal system. Certainly, there is an attempt to 
					separate America from the world by the terrorists, but the 
					logic of killing sixty different nationalities in the Trade 
					Center tragedy escapes me. America is no longer protected by 
					isolation. That is now clear but in turn it is now a partner 
					in a world without borders. Green is the color of 
					international business and bravery is the color of freedom.

					Now, it is the last day of a year of turmoil for the world 
					and adventure for us, mostly good but some not. It is a year 
					that set us on a course that we needed as a break from what 
					we had been doing. It has not been an easy year, but nothing 
					worthwhile is easy. My creative work is at a quality height 
					that I have wanted for some time and my work has been shown 
					internationally. Returning to Tbilisi, Georgia, to finish up 
					the teaching and all the other projects will not be hard. In 
					fact, it will be much easier than if we stayed there over 
					the holidays. </p>

					Every morning I wake to the lithograph of Matisse’s drawing 
					of a woman’s face, the essence of beauty and simplicity. The 
					line work captures all the elements that traditional 
					Renaissance classical drawing conveys. It does what I saw in 
					the classic beauty of the faces of women in Georgia. This 
					morning I try to draw it from memory, a memory device for me 
					to etch it in my mind. It is the same device that I used in 
					Kutaisi to learn the names and faces of the artists with 
					which I shared a month. I see the little upturn of the line 
					at the edge of the mouth, the long pure line of the nose 
					(ending in the small hook that directs attention back to the 
					mouth), and the almond-shaped eyes that stare out at the 
					world with child-like innocence. The line of the hair pushes 
					in upon the oval of the face. It is so perfect and complete, 
					just the right combination, just the correct proportions, 
					and just the ultimate degree of confidence in the line. I 
					did three sketches and only came close on one to what 
					Matisse had so easily done without seeming effort. I marvel 
					at his genius. Picasso, another artist I admire, used 
					innovation in his drawings to astound his viewer whereas 
					Matisse uses subtle line and unerring craft. He is the 
					master of the line. It is a wonder that a man could capture 
					the plastic unity of a woman’s face, hold it all together 
					and share that beauty in a few perfectly chosen lines. I 
					remember the men standing around in Tbilisi and the peace 
					and openness here.</p>

					To end our stay in America, we fly to Pittsburgh on Friday 
					and on Saturday, Anne and I celebrated our 45th anniversary, 
					high above the city and its lights on Mount Washington. 
					Below is the meeting of the three rivers, Phillip Johnson’s 
					glass masterpiece of the PPG Center and memories of earlier 
					times when all of us were young. Lou, my brother in law, and 
					I ate at the Oyster House on Market Street, across from the 
					market where my grandfather sold fish. It is a place where 
					my father took me many times. They still make the largest, 
					most delicious fish sandwich in the world. The waitress is 
					still a “smart aleck” but now quite old (ancient, in fact). 
					Memories of good times flood my mind. Why is it as we age

					On the way back, I find that travel is not as much fun as it 
					once was. Security is high everywhere now. I am searched 
					three times, twice by taking off my shoes. There is a 
					tension in the air. People are afraid that they will make a 
					mistake and they make mistakes. One couple on the plane got 
					very upset when an Indian couple changed seats, with the 
					permission of the stewardess, and he had to sit beside them. 
					Another man who saw the interchange gave up his seat so that 
					they could sit together but the first man was still uptight.</p>

					While relaxing on the airplane, I ask myself, “What had been 
					accomplished on this stay in America?” Rest is the first 
					answer, while relaxing the inner life as well as the body. 
					We viewed three exceptional movies. I cataloged, cropped and 
					enhanced all my photographs from Georgia and created several 
					slide shows for the computer. I played with my new visual 
					computer toy, which I will turn into paintings on arriving 
					back in Tbilisi. Mostly I go back to Georgia refreshed, 
					knowing what must be accomplished and ready to do the work.</p>

					On the nine hour flight from Detroit to Amsterdam, I find 
					that time is a subjective dimension. An image flashes up on 
					the television and movie screen, stating “Ten minutes to the 
					movie.” Having nothing else to do and nowhere to go, I try 
					to count the seconds in my head for a minute. I come to the 
					conclusion that air time is longer than actual time. I 
					mention this astute observation to Anne, who has a science 
					background, and she hands me her watch without a word. I 
					time the minute again. Of course, it is exactly one minute 
					by the watch. Now with the 600 miles to Amsterdam, I know 
					that my psychological time is different than real time and I 
					think, “We do crazy things to pass the time.”</p>

					Early morning has become a routine for me, waking with the 
					sun and the sounds of 1.6 million heartbeats of Tbilisi. 
					Being back in the city is easier and harder than before. I 
					have none of the adventurer’s illusions. I will just add to 
					the knowledge base of a few key players and students which 
					might make change happen in the long run. Tbilisi is an 
					overpopulated city with an unemployed male workforce that is 
					dynamic ready to explode. As I drive the streets with 
					Raphael and Anne, I see it in the park and at the bazaar. In 
					the few months that I have left here, I will built the 
					playground, establish the American art resource library, 
					teach my classes in museum management, American art and 
					architecture, and 20<sup>th</sup> century art criticism,

					As we stroll along Rustevili Avenue, every ten feet there is 
					a beggar. Going under the street to get to the other side, 
					there are mothers with rag doll children in one arm and a 
					hand out with the other, out of work musicians play for 
					their hat of coins, and small shop keepers try to make a 
					meager living. Anne always puts something in an extended 
					hand. I mention all this because the contrast is so great 
					when you take your seats in the Opera House. It is always 
					filled. The tickets cost from 5 lari ($2.50) to 20 lari 
					($10.00 for an expensive production) but it makes no 
					difference in the cost. It is always filled to the fifth 
					tier of seats. Mothers and fathers bring their children. I 
					am still astonished by this. This image of support will stay 
					with me when I go back to America. Here are a people who

					chains as the first act ends. My giant of a man hangs his

					When we were in Waco at Christmas time, Anne picked up a

					nearly as immediate metamorphosis of most foods from solid

					One of the reasons that I wanted to come to Georgia was to 
					see wonderful examples of Byzantine and Georgian 
					architecture of the 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> 
					century.&nbsp; In front of an ex-hotel which the Russians built, 
					in the center of Tbilisi, now filled with poverty-stricken 
					IDPs (Independent Displaced Persons, who are different than 
					refugees who come across borders), stands the grand statue 
					of the Bagraid king David II Aghmashenchechi (1089-1125). 
					Each time we pass, my driver Raphael points out how he, 
					although only 16, defeated the Seijuk Turks at the Battle of 
					Dadgori in 1121, ushering in Georgia’s golden age of 
					architecture. This period was short-lived for the Mongols 
					came sweeping through the South Caucasus in the 12<sup>th</sup> 
					and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries. What followed are the Ottoman 
					Empire and the Persian invasions, interspersed with brief 
					period of freedom, and then the iron grip of the Russians 
					from the 18<sup>th</sup> century to 1991. All that one can 
					call Russian utilitarian structures is “concrete ugly” and 
					the worst form of architecture for humans to live within. 
					The hotel behind the statue of King David is a good example 
					of bad architecture and Georgians shake their heads because 
					the Russians left many examples of that.</p>

					On the hill, grandly overlooking the city of Kutaisi, stands 
					Bagrati Cathedral, a church built in 1003 A.D., destroyed 
					many times and rebuilt. There is a long winding, cobblestone 
					road to the church which is walked by the citizens on holy 
					days. We walked it when the yearly procession of the 
					Madonna’s icon, the city’s official relic, is taken to the 
					church. Standing in the services, the sky as the only roof, 
					you feel like you are in grand open air Gothic cathedral, 
					although the rounded arches tell you this is pure Romanesque 
					architecture. In this structure, you can see the improvement 
					in opening the walls with arches when contrasted to the 
					Kharagauli church built in the 8<sup>th</sup> century where 
					the structure is more closed in although the cupping out of 
					space has begun.&nbsp; Frank Lloyd Wright calls architecture “a 
					womb with a view”. The close space and semi-domes cupping 
					out cave-like areas of the Romanesque style do give a 
					feeling of sheltering comfort. Anyone thinking about it 
					knows that “mother” is the first home, the cave follows 
					shortly, and then constructed structures to keep out the 
					elements and retain warmth and coolness. </p>

					In Eastern Georgia (Bagridi Cathedral was in Western

					the central-domed churches so typical of Georgia. In “old

					Therefore it was with great interest that I went to see 
					Victor Djorbenadze’s “Wedding Chapel”, on the left high-bank 
					of the Kura River in Tbilisi. Rolf Gross makes the 
					statement, “Victor Djorbenadze was one of the remarkable 
					architects of the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century…the 
					Wedding Cathedral shows him to be one of the great 
					architects of Europe, with a sophisticated architectural 
					brut, which orients itself on Le Corbusier and Frank Gehry.” 
					That is high praise indeed. Le Corbusier was the main 
					architect of the International style which made the glass 
					buildings of New York, Dallas and Houston possible and Frank 
					Gehry is the originator of the revolutionary Guggenheim 
					Museum in Balboa, Spain. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					It is a miracle that this work of art was built at all. 
					Djorbenadze was a homosexual in a culture where that is 
					unofficially condemned. Fortunately, he was backed by Edward 
					Shevardnadze, present President of Georgia but then chairman 
					of the Communist Party (a act of courage on Shevardnadze’s 
					part because Djorbenadze was not a member of the Party). The 
					castle-like outside, sheathed in limestone facing, is 
					spectacular but the inside is purely Georgian with rounded 
					curves (similar to Georgian letters and the Georgian love of 
					“mother”). When asked about the floor plan, Djorbenadze 
					confessed that the female reproductive system was his basic 
					form.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					Djorbenadze’s cathedral has been somewhat ignored today 
					because of the Georgian justifiable dislike of anything 
					“Russian in design” but this building, although built under 
					Russian rule, is pristine Georgian. Looking up into 
					cross-wise overlapping wooden beams that form a “false 
					dome”, one is reminded of those early cone-like structures 
					of Georgian farm homes (which can be seen at the Tbilisi 
					Open Air Museum and in Miskheta). Victor Djorbenadze died 
					forgotten and disparaged in 1999. The neglected Wedding 
					Cathedral is slowly crumbling. As Rolf Gross writes, “There 
					is nothing like it in the former Soviet Union”.&nbsp; But as a 
					wedding cathedral, it may have seen its time. There are too 
					many unpleasant memories of the Communists repression of 
					Georgian Christianity. Georgians are returning to their 
					traditional churches for services and marriage (as it should 
					be) but it is time to rehabilitate the man and find a new 
					use for this original and remarkable work of art.*</p>

					Now came the second surprise. I had journeyed to Tbilisi, 
					Georgia to learn about the art and its people. All the 
					research that I did before coming told me that the art was 
					about 100 years behind the times, black and white with a 
					little color thrown in and no modern art concepts. When 
					Kakabadze went to Paris in 1921, he was a leader in the 
					Cubist movement, exhibiting alongside Picasso, Braque and 
					Leger. Long before Kandinsky finally came to Paris in 1930s, 
					Kakabadze was doing biological cubism with images that came 
					alive under an artist’s microscopic eye. Kakabadze had been 
					trained as a biologist as well as a painter. His work was 
					not of cubism but went beyond cubism in its concepts.. The 
					excitement that his work created, being so far in front of 
					what was happening in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, 
					made me want to see his studio in the next room. If a man 
					can create all this from 1921 through 1927, what miracles of 
					art could he create for Georgia when he returned in 1928? 
					His revolutionary historian friend who lived several houses 
					away tried to get word to Kakabadze that he should stay in 
					Paris. “The Soviet Regime is oppressive and does not allow 
					any new ideas to flourish in Georgia” was the message. But 
					the young artist could not believe how bad the situation was 
					in his beloved country so he returned.</p>

					The first thing that the Soviets did was outlaw any painting

					Only Socialist Realism was allowed. If a young painter 
					wished to feed his wife and children, he painted the party 
					line. It was impossible for him. Cubism kept coming into his 
					compositions. He had secured a teaching job at the Academy 
					where I now teach. He was popular and loved by his students 
					for his understanding and ideas. Yet, he was forced to teach 
					only Socialist Realism and in 1948 he was dismissed because 
					he was not a zealot of Socialist Realism. He was banned from 
					any profession to make a living. He lived from the kindness 
					of strangers and friends. This lasted for four years until 
					his heart gave out and he died in 1952. Oh, I forgot to tell 
					this part of the story. All his students got failing marks

					No American can imagine what this hero of Georgia went 
					through for his country. He had to silence his ideas about 
					art (which were beyond their time and at the edge of what 
					was happening in modern art), give up his teaching and 
					finally give up his life just because he returned to the 
					country he loved so deeply. The Communists would not allow 
					him to leave the country. He was threatened with death if he 
					spread “modern ideas” to the young. He was blacklisted so he 
					could not make any living from his talents. In Paris in the 
					1920s, the American Katherine Drier and her friend Marcel 
					Duchamp purchased many works by Kakabadze. They are some of 
					the treasures of the Yale University Art Collection, taking 
					their rightful place side by side with Picasso, Braque and 
					Leger. And now in Georgia, David Kakabadze is known as a 
					great artist, a patriot and a tragic victim of Communism. I 
					learned that the cobblestone street where his studio, his 
					widow and Ronald McDonald live is called Kakabadze Street.

					Anne and I go to the Georgian National Museum, open from 
					11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., which specializes in archeological 
					finds before the time of Christ. We have attempted this tour 
					four other times but each time the electricity is off. The

					although this is a national museum. This time we are 
					determined to view some aspects of the collection but there 
					is still no electricity for the upper floors. Only the gold 
					collection has lights; no heat but lights. We pay for our 
					ticket and a woman who speaks English consents to guide us 
					through the gold and silver treasures. She has worked there 
					for 35 years. The tour takes over two hours and we leave 
					only then because the museum is closing for the day. I now 
					know more than I ever wish to know about the art of 
					goldsmithing in Georgia but she is determined to be thorough 
					and we are determined that if she can take the freezing 
					chamber we will follow her. It is much colder there down in 
					the subbasement than outside (again, because of the 
					architecture and the practice of building four to five foot 
					thick walls to hold the night’s coolness which works if you 
					have some way to warm the air a little). As our legs get a

					for a computer briefing. Getting there early, I am asked by 
					the man setting up the computer, “Why are you here?” “I am a 
					Fulbright Scholar who uses the computers when mine is down 
					and I need to read my emails.” “You have no government 
					clearance.” I am sure that was a statement, not a question. 
					“All you do is get into Hotmail?” That was a question, I 
					knew, from the look on the man’s face. “Yes, I read 
					Hotmail.” “Then you don’t have to be here.” “OK,” I said 
					smiling, “I will leave. Someone said that I was required to 
					come to this before I could use the computers again.” At 
					this moment, a second man who had said nothing, pulls the 
					first man aside and begins whispering as I gather up my 
					sketchbook and pens. He returns before I am ready to leave. 
					“I’d appreciate it if you stayed,” he says in a government 
					tone which means ‘you better’, “officially, you do not have 
					to but I would appreciate it.” I sit down again, “OK.” You 
					get used to this in Georgia but as the King says in The King 
					and I, “It is a puzzlement.”</p>

					Yesterday, we went to the bazaar to try to find acrylic

					I spend two days interviewing candidates for the Junior 
					Faculty Development Program to send Georgian faculty to 
					America. It is administered by the American Council. Over 
					the two days, a Georgian professor and myself thought that 
					we had six top candidates, out of twenty-one, for four 
					positions. The final decision will be made in Washington. 
					One excellent faculty member who teaches film and acting 
					told a story about finishing her movie which was praised 
					finally at the Cannes Film Festival, Moscow Festival, St. 
					Petersburg International Festival and the Kiev World 
					Festival. She told a story about making 15 to 16 films a 
					year in Soviet times, with the backing of the Communist 
					government (not everything was bad then). Now in the last 
					ten years, only six films have been created and she did two 
					of them. The Georgian government has put no money into a 
					film industry which was world class for years before the war 
					for independence. We asked her, since she was applying to 
					study arts management in America, how she got her film 
					finished that won so many honors. She said, “I went to all 
					the sources that I could find but for two years I had no 
					luck. Finally, I found a man to back my film.” Naively, I 
					asked, “And he was a patron of the arts? In the States, we 
					call that ‘an angel’.” “No,” she said with straight-forward 
					honesty and a serious look, “I sold my flesh.” I glance at 
					my co-examiner and she did not make any reaction to this 
					statement. Obviously, she has heard stories like this 
					before. </p>

					After that, I would have given her any scholarship to 
					improve herself and her exceptional art. There must be 
					stories like this all over Georgia. My partner just shook 
					her head, “Yes,” and went on to the next question as if the 
					young woman, age 50, had said, “I received a grant which 
					took two years to successfully obtain!” This woman is a 
					survivor where survival is king and queen and pawn and 
					everything. Americans cannot understand the dignity with 
					which this lovely, strong, courageous woman said, “I sold my 
					flesh.” How many artists would give up something that 
					precious to pursue excellence in their art? She saved her 
					inner soul and her inner dignity as an artist and a person 
					but she sacrificed something too. Selling your flesh is not 
					something which should be looked upon as degrading but a 
					statement of strength in this case to move into the future 
					with her head high. Was I impressed? More than words can 
					ever say; more than anyone will know. She said those words 
					as if they are normal and matter of fact but each word is 
					filled with resolve and purpose. It says, “I will anything 
					for my art. My inner being is more important than my body. I 
					will do what needs to be done and will move on.” Her film 
					won an award at the Cannes Film Festival but for me her 
					greatest reward is her resolve to create something personal, 
					yet a film that transcends the individual to a universal 
					statement.</p>

					side of the road, it drops off to a white field. Now we are 
					in the valley of the “high hills” with icicle-dripping rocks

					It has taken me a while but I have come to the conclusion 
					that there are two centers of life in Tbilisi. There is 
					Rustavili Avenue, the six-lane Broadway of this city of 1.6 
					million people. In terms of many cities in the world, that 
					does not seem like a lot of individuals living in the same 
					place but this is a country with a population of 3.5 
					million. Rustavili Avenue is the tourist center and young 
					people’s gathering place. All the theaters and most of the 
					upscale restaurants border its sides. Its main architectural 
					symbols are the multiple rounded arches and the refuge hotel 
					behind the statue of King David on the turn-around circle 
					for traffic. The arches were the Soviet way to signify the 
					center of commerce. Now the arches houses a restaurant 
					called Montmarte. The “refuge” hotel is a continual eye sore 
					for Tbilisi, with the plywood partitions enclosing the 
					balconies and laundry always hanging from the metal fences 
					and windows. “Refuge” is not the correct term, although it 
					is used by visitors and citizens alike to describe the 
					place. Technically speaking, a refuge is someone who comes 
					from outside the country and is given asylum. These are 
					“displaced persons” from northern Georgia where the battle 
					still wages on who owns that region. The Georgian government 
					claims Abkhazia as part of Georgia, Abkhazia wants it as 
					their own country, and Russia says that it is still part of 
					their empire. Most of the terrorists who plague Tbilisi and 
					Russia come from this remote mountain region. Also this is 
					the region where the Russian have been bombing in recent 
					months in their “war on terrorism”. Russia says that this 
					northern Georgian region is the haven for Chechen 
					terrorists. On November 27-28, two Russian military jets 
					SU-25’s and four assaulting helicopters MI-24 broke into 
					Georgian air space, pounded the mountain slopes of Pankisi 
					gorge. Rustavili Avenue is dangerous after dark we are told. 
					The American Embassy of Georgia put out an alert about a 
					threat to all Americans in Tbilisi of kidnapping in October 
					and another alert after a German diplomat was murdered in 
					December.&nbsp; During the day, this area is alive with citizens, 
					paying bills at the telephone building, walking the streets 
					to look in shop windows, buying things from street stays and 
					of course getting a Big Mac from MacDonald’s main 
					restaurant. </p>

					But after you get to know Tbilisi better, you find that the 
					heartbeat of business, commerce and shopping is not in this 
					city center but the other one across the river, Tbilisi’s 
					largest bazaar. The bazaar is roughly three to four square 
					miles of open-air stands that sell “everything” from food to 
					the kitchen sink. I mean literally kitchen sinks, bathrooms, 
					plumbing supplies, hardware, tape, paint, wire, lumber, 
					plywood, food and anything else&nbsp; Russians, Turks, English, 
					Dutch, Georgian, Greeks, Germans, etc. wish to sell. My 
					driver, and in Tbilisi you must have a driver for protection 
					as well as transportation, Raphael, takes me to the bazaar 
					for whatever is needed in our daily lives. We break a 
					connector on our commode. Go to the bazaar. Need material to 
					put up an exhibition of art. Go to the bazaar. Need clothes. 
					Need daily things. Need food. Go to the bazaar. Surrounding 
					the bazaar, starting early in the morning, are men looking 
					for work with their signs and tools lined up beside the 
					road. The bazaar itself is a labyrinth of shops. In fact, 
					sometimes two or three shops are in the same space and only 
					when you pay do you understand that it is run by more than 
					one owner. The walkways are dirt. There is no protection 
					from the weather. To find what you need, you must take the 
					time to stop and look at each place, each object for sale, 
					while walking the winding, narrow passageways. Actually this 
					bazaar is three bazaars, one for food, one for small objects 
					and one for construction materials and large items. There 
					are no signs telling you what is where so you must allow 
					time to shop. It opens at about ten in the morning and 
					closes when the sun goes down. It stays open in all kinds of 
					weather in every season of the year. If you come when it 
					opens, you can watch merchants shoveling potatoes from the 
					back of large, enclosed trucks into canvas bags and then 
					marvel at shoppers who somehow tie on top, on the side, and 
					cram produce bags inside overloaded cars. They come from 
					Tbilisi or nearby villages. Whole families come and whole 
					families sell the wares. It is life at its elemental base 
					with some luxuries for those with the money to buy. 
					Merchants know a foreigner by how we shop. We are infrequent 
					shopper. Three or four times a week, the average citizen 
					buys at the bazaar. Almost all the time, it is less 
					expensive than shopping along Rustavili Avenue. Also, there 
					is little danger because it never stays open at night with 
					its limited electricity and no bathrooms. But if you listen 
					carefully as you meander through its maze, you can hear a 
					heart beating. It is the people’s commercial organ of 
					Tbilisi. </p>

					Waking early in the morning, which is the pattern for my 
					sleep schedule in Tbilisi, I lie a moment, thinking about 
					the strange dream that still slips in and out of my 
					consciousness. I was the bureau chief for a national 
					newspaper, newly positioned, and I sent out a correspondent 
					to get a story. It gets a little cloudy in terms of the 
					detail from here on when I try to place myself in the 
					correspondent’s body. What is clear is the next scene. I am 
					sitting under a large, gnarled old tree in the courtyard of 
					a small town in the Middle East and a drop of blood appears 
					on my hand. As I look up, I see the body of the 
					correspondent in the limps of the tree. Somehow the person 
					who killed him placed the body there for us to find. Only 
					one drop of blood came from the body but it was enough. I 
					sent off another human being to get a story and he became 
					the story. Even the murderer knew that. He sent back the 
					body to tell the world that this is what happens to 
					Americans who come to this part of the world for stories. 
					They become the story.</p>

					On waking I returned to CNN on my laptop. In Tbilisi, 
					Georgia, we have no television or radio. In the last eight 
					days, the electricity has been off each day more than it has 
					been on so television or radio is not a sure source of 
					information. And even if we did have electricity, all the 
					news is in Georgian therefore no television, no radio, just 
					internet. Shortly after the abduction of Daniel Pearl, the 
					Wall Street Journal reporter, who was kidnapped in Pakistan, 
					the US Department of State sent out one of its periodic 
					warnings to alert all Americans about the danger of 
					kidnapping. In three months in Georgia, it is the third 
					warning, with one briefing to go with the printed word. The 
					message is clear, “Do all that you can to not become a 
					kidnap victim?”</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					You wonder at time if those announcements are really for us 
					or are our government’s way to say, “We told them to be 
					careful.” In the normal course of events, you make contacts 
					with individuals in the country where you are staying. 
					Daniel Pearl came to the Middle East to fill out a story on 
					the terrorist Richard Reid. He had to make contacts. That is 
					how one gets a story. He contacted a man named Bashir, who 
					it was found out later to be Sheikh Omar, a terrorist leader 
					in Pakistan. The contacts were simple: emails passed back 
					and forth. One from Bashir read, “I am sorry to have not 
					replied to you earlier. I was preoccupied with looking after 
					my wife who has been ill. Please pray for her health.”</p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					Pearl consented to meet Bashir outside a restaurant and he 
					was kidnapped on January 23. I noticed that the Olympics are 
					the lead story now on CNN and Pearl is secondary news. Yet 
					he is still a story in the making. What will propel Pearl

					Even the kidnappers know, like my killer in my dream, that 
					the real story is America’s concept of the value in a single 
					life. We do hold some truths as self evident. One of them is 
					that American life and American freedom is precise. Pearl 
					was not kidnapped as a person but as a valued pawn to play 
					on some global chessboard.. Yet once he was kidnapped, other 
					Americans value Daniel Pearl as an individual. If Pearl had 
					gotten his story about Richard Reid’s connection to al-Queda 
					and bin Laden, he would have had his reporter’s byline at 
					the top or bottom of a story. Now it is clear that he is the 
					story.</p>

					We value one drop of American blood. We value human life in 
					a way that is strange to many in this part of the world. As 
					I teach American art to Georgians, it is critical to teach 
					American values and American democracy. The work of art is 
					only the story when the artist is less famous than his 
					painting or sculpture or performance. I teach about Texas 
					artists who become the story when they are seen in the

					To live abroad, you are constantly reminded by other 
					Americans and by the Department of State, “You can become 
					the story.” But how is anyone know if the person following 
					you is a terrorist who is targeting you for kidnapping or a 
					friendly person just interested in improving his English? 
					Americans cannot conduct daily life abroad in fear and there 
					has to be some degree of trust. You wish to keep your 
					humanity alive no matter where you are. Especially after you 
					learn that a contact has a wife who is ill, has children 
					that he loves, and wishes to call you, “Friend”. But trust 
					is difficult and takes time when there is the threat always 
					of one drop of blood. The problem is, when looking for a 
					story, time is not a luxury that a reporter has. The bureau 
					chief wants it while the story is hot.</p>

					presence. Your skin is so wonderful and fresh.” “Have you 
					seen the age spots on my hands?” she asked. “No,” I 
					answered, “you are always YOU to me.” “That’s not logical,” 
					she replied as she turned a page in her new book. “Logic 
					does not interest me right now,” I smiled, rolling on my

					to sleep when the moon shines or not. It is the style of

					make, it is corrupt and will put the money in their own 
					pocket? I tried to consider this logically but was

					Tbilisi, Georgia: We went out tonight to our favorite 
					Georgian pizza place. We had three beers, a small bowl of 
					garlic bread, Capri pizza for me, and pasta with spinach for 
					Anne, all for $15 USD. As I ate the pizza, enjoying the 
					olives and the artichokes, I thought about how the small 
					things in life shape our existence. It is not September 11<sup>th</sup>, 
					or the putting together the American Art Collection here as 
					part of my Fulbright grant, or building the first playground 
					in Tbilisi with the help of B. Rapoport, or teaching my 
					classes at the Academy, or the work with the 
					Non-Governmental Organization’s and the art dealers, or the 
					chance to paint and show in national exhibitions, or 
					attending ballets, operas and shows. It is all of that plus 
					olives and artichokes. I think that I have come to the point 
					where I am a rock where water is slowly (and in the case of 
					9/11 quickly) dripping to shape my existence. We cannot 
					change the shape that we take in a general sense although we 
					can open new currents of water and the pace of the dripping. 
					I cannot believe that my shape is predetermined so I fight 
					against the dripping of the day-to-day and try to shape my 
					own existence but I know that in one sense my struggle is 
					futile. Maybe that is why I keep the day-to-day journal. It 
					records the dripping and the shaping. And in the recording, 
					the observations, I step outside the action and shape the 
					inner life. As the king says in The King and I, “It is a 
					puzzlement.”</p>

					Being far away from your home country, in a land where the 
					language is strange even in the world of languages since 
					Georgian is one of the fourteen world languages but is only 
					used in Georgia, you think and read a lot. Recently on 
					reading again a 1976 publication by Edward T. Hall, called 
					Beyond Culture, I was reminded of the artist’s, the 
					creator’s need to forget. Children learn it as they play. 
					You purposely forget so that you can see the world with 
					fresh eyes. Hall’s says, “The failure to understand the 
					significance of play in maturing human beings has had 
					incalculable consequences, because play is not only crucial 
					to learning but (unlike other drives) is its own reward.”</p>

					To an artist, forgetting is critical to any pursuit. I have 
					the kind of mind that can remember brushstrokes as I walk 
					through a museum exhibition. It gets in the way when I pick 
					up a brush for a new painting. Therefore the first hour or 
					so of painting is to forget all those other painter’s 
					solutions in my mind’s eye. This allows me, or any creative 
					person, to come to material with fresh eyes. The poet, 
					dancer, writer, musician, inventor or learner can find 
					individual and new solutions to “stuff” that others have 
					only seen through established patterns or forms. The Russian 
					scientist Luria in the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century 
					established the importance of forgetting in his book The 
					Mind of a Mnemonist, the life story of a man who could not 
					forget anything and remember everything that was placed 
					before him. On first sight this would seem a blessing but on 
					closer look, the man was a mental cripple. If you gave this 
					man a problem to solve, as a visualizer he could solve it. 
					But he could not understand poetry and abstract ideas. 
					“Infinity” and “nothing” were beyond his mental grasp. </p>

					I remember in school when the teachers would reward the 
					students who could memorize the best. I could not. It took 
					me years to find ways to keep things in my mind. I was 
					always seeing the world with fresh eyes and drawing/painting 
					it with those visions. I finally learned that if I put a 
					context to the data that I could remember it and by taking 
					away the context forget it as easily. This has practical 
					implications. At one point in my life I&nbsp; build houses from 
					the ground up. I did five over the years, from the 
					architectural plan to the last nail or the trawl of 
					concrete. After the first house, I found that I had to 
					forget all the bad things that happened, all the aching 
					muscles and long hours, all the feelings of disappointment 
					when something did not come out as I planned before I could 
					start a new project. Since I am a visualizer who remembered 
					pictures of things placed in front of me, I had to learn to 
					forget them so they did not get in the way when I wanted to 
					have a new vision.</p>

					I found that it helps to know how the brain works and that 
					there are ways to help you forget. Japanese Zen monks repeat 
					a phrase until the words are lost and only the sound 
					resonated in the soul of the priest. As Hall says, “The 
					reason man does not experience his true cultural self is 
					that until he experiences another self as valid, he has 
					little basis for validating his own self.”&nbsp; At points in my 
					life I travel to find my other self, to forget the Western 
					man that could only see with Western eyes. In the West, we 
					place logic and irrationality at two opposing poles. Recent 
					mind studies find that they are positioned in the same place 
					in the brain. Irrationality is a way to start the process 
					toward logic and visa versa. In the front of the brain are 
					the faculties for perception, body movement, performance of 
					planned action, memorizing, and problem solving. If you 
					dance, it helps with problem solving or your performance of 
					a planned action. You can memorize better if you clear the 
					mind of old “stuff” that clutters up the corners. Forgetting 
					is essential to creativity. It is too bad that the warring 
					factions in the Middle East never learned that lesson. In 
					the long run for a human to enjoy the freshness of spring, a 
					new rain, another sun-filled day, your child’s small hand is 
					yours, love and sex, forgetting is as important as 
					remembering. </p>

					The one historical fact about America is our ability to

					team, “Today we play our cross-town rivals UCLA for the 
					national championship. It is the most important game in your 
					life, in your football career. Nothing can change that at

					The room at the National State University where I am

					row upon row of seats for students, and on the side another 
					row of chairs for visiting professors and guests. The idea 
					is to create a physical and psychological wall between the 
					professor and the student. I discussed this arrangement this 
					morning, pointing out that this has not been how artists 
					have arranged space since the late Renaissance with 
					Caravaggio’s paintings or Elizabethan times with 
					Shakespeare’s Globe Theater or his plays. The artist sets 
					out to break the imaginary “picture plane” between the 
					viewer (audience) and the action. I do all that I can this 
					morning to do this. I have student’s invade the professor’s 
					space to hold up cards. I wear a funny hat from Disneyland 
					to make them laugh and shorten the distance between student 
					and teacher. I show them the “cow project” of Zurich, 
					Chicago, New York and Waco which is an artistic as well as a 
					financial/tourist event. Lastly, I discuss the sculpture of 
					Nancy Graves, using a video by Penn and Teller. The class

					wall which has been built by Russia and Georgia for years 
					since no student interrupted me with a question as we make 
					this journey, and in another way I succeed. After the class,

					to create a large photography exhibition of Robert Capa 
					photos (200-300) of Georgia with the writings of John 
					Steinbeck. The two Americans traveled all through the 
					Caucasus region with Capa taking over 4000 photographs. 
					Lastly, I worked with Maka Dvalishvili, Director of the 
					Georgian Arts and Cultural Center, who is a whirlwind of 
					projects on which she needs my help. I just proofread her 
					narrative to the Brooklyn Museum to send her museum 
					reproductions and we are jointly working on a grant to 
					create a newsletter, hard and website, for information to 
					organizations, artists and an interested public. Now, she is 
					beginning to plan a large exhibition to send to the United 
					States but someone from America must request it in writing. 
					She says that she trusts me to do it for her. I probably 
					will since we do trust each other. That is the coin of 
					working together in Georgia. In truth, it is the criteria 
					for working together anywhere in the world. The last 
					appointment of the day is to be at the American Embassy&nbsp; for 
					a grant on arts management in the performing arts.</p>

					Sharon Hudson Dean, the director of the Cultural Affairs 
					Division, asked my opinion on a proposal to bring three 
					performing arts professionals to Georgia for a four-day 
					workshop in arts management. She explains the idea and the 
					cost, $10,000. My first reaction was again, “This is 
					ridiculous.” I see no way that anyone can do any good in 
					Georgia in four days. It has taken me four months to build 
					trust with only a few of the arts managers and other 
					professionals. All you can do in four days is come, drink 
					cocktails at the Sheridan Metichi Hotel, eat good Georgian 
					food, visit a few locations (the walk-through where nothing 
					is seen of how the organization really functions), and give 
					a lecture with some practical suggestions and leave. I see 
					no worth in the project. It has not been thought out for a 
					lasting change. I will meet with the woman who is planning 
					it but I have great misgivings on its worth.</p>

					I am asked to extend my stay in Georgia and complete some of 
					the projects which I have jointly started with Georgians. It 
					is flattering but it is not in the best interest of Anne, or 
					me, or the people I work with. At some point in any venture, 
					it is time to leave. Georgians must solve Georgian problems, 
					using ideas that come from anywhere and techniques which I 
					might have helped them with in the course of my stay. On 
					email, it makes no difference if I am here or anywhere else. 
					Distance does not exist on email or a conference call. At 
					one time in history, distance was a determinate to 
					communications. Now, no! I am sure that Maka, Keti and Irina 
					will continue to communicate with me and I will continue to 
					help them from an American base. In what this society needs, 
					it is more important that they have people they trust in 
					America than working beside them here.</p>
