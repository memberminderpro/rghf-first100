					An alert goes out to meet at the Sheridan Metechi Palace 
					Hotel on September 28<sup>th</sup>. It is a meeting of all 
					Americans. There is a system where wardens are chosen to get 
					out the word to all American citizens if there is a threat 
					of any kind. At this general meeting, attended by over 300, 
					we are informed that the Georgian police have discovered 
					that Embassy personnel have been followed with the purpose 
					of kidnapping. We are told, “At this time, we know of no 
					threat to non-Embassy people but a warning of increased 
					caution is in order.” One lady asks, “How can you tell if 
					you are being followed?” The answer is vague, since many 
					Georgians follow Americans to hear English and improve their 
					own skills in that language. Afterwards we journey with a 
					number of Americans and their friends to a restaurant that 
					has great pizza. With the alert still in our minds, it is 
					good to hear English spoken and sit in the midst of a group 
					where you think you knew their intent. Raphael, our driver, 
					picks us up when we call on our cell phone. No one can rely 
					calling on a regular phone. Raphael is a fine guitarist who 
					cannot find work in his field because of the economy. One 
					couple at the restaurant has an architect driving for them, 
					another a doctor, another a scientist, and so it goes. 
					Raphael is very good at his job. He drives us home and then 
					watches while we get into the apartment. He is part of our 
					protection against the threat for which we were alerted.</p>

					I learned yesterday that the reason that I got $500 for the 
					International Plenary of Artist in Kutaisi instead of the 
					$700 that was promised was that I was re-categorized at the 
					end of the session as a “graphic artist” instead of a 
					“painter”. It made no difference to them that I create 
					paintings. The criteria I now know is that graphic artists 
					work on paper and painters work on canvas. The old Soviet 
					system is still alive, well and functioning. It also makes 
					no difference that the canvases were awful to work upon and 
					the paper a little better but with perseverance one could 
					create a quality work of art. It also makes no difference 
					that I was never told of this distinction and outmoded 
					definition. I had stepped into the 19<sup>th</sup> century 
					with the Communists still in positions of power. What would 
					they have done with my friend Robert Wilson who does not 
					even do his own creations but hires skilled craftsmen to do 
					his work for him? Who is paid more in the space program at 
					NASA: the craftsman on the line or the artist/scientist who 
					dreams of the way to the stars? Sweat is not the criteria 
					for quality and value in the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> 
					century. The concepts are not only out of date but truly 
					primitive. I will teach that the 20<sup>th</sup> century 
					recognizes works on paper as paintings, not a definition 
					rooted in the dim past without any present rationality to 
					justify it. Of course, I will teach at the Tbilisi State 
					Academy of Fine Arts which still classifies its professors 
					as “graphic artists” and “painters”, paying them accordingly 
					(paying each classification too little to live upon).</p>

					At one time in history, there was a need for the artist to 
					be the producer as well as the creator of the idea. Now, I 
					do not know of one architect who paints his ideas in the 
					design phase to present to a client or places one stone on 
					another when the construction phase starts. Title is not the 
					coin of the realm today; information is. But should I really 
					be surprised with this? The rules were constantly changed 
					all the time in Kutaisi. They functioned by the old Soviet 
					system. Wait and I will tell you what to think and do! There 
					was no concept of purpose or goal about the program. Artists 
					were not encouraged to exchange ideas but to work, to 
					complete the required five works of art. It was a program 
					for workers of the world…. I created over 40 paintings in 
					the 30 days (of which, they only received the five that was 
					ordained). As one artist from France said, “This is a 
					pattern etched into an antiquated past.” Maybe one thing 
					that this Fulbright Scholar can do in his time here in 
					Georgia is to help some young people step into the 21<sup>st</sup> 
					century. </p>

					In this century, idea is everything. Material is only the 
					skin for the idea. It is not without reason that “a work of 
					art” is called that, separating the “work” from the “art”. 
					At one time in history, work and skilled laborers was rare 
					(ending in the 18<sup>th</sup> century or earlier) therefore 
					the artist was the maker and material was tied to the 
					“idea”. This is no longer true. Anyone with an idea can hire 
					skilled craftsmen to execute “work” for the “art”. Wilson 
					has proved that over and over again. He created one idea in 
					theater while workers sculpt or paint another idea while 
					still others prepare the opera house for his scenes for a 
					classic opera. The future belongs to the idea man. All of 
					Europe, America and Asia has embraced this concept. 
					Information and creative thought is the future. I have been 
					reading F. L. Wright’s “The Future of Architecture” where he 
					separates the past from the present in terms of the 
					percentage of skilled laborers available. He says the 
					machine is the tool of the 20<sup>th</sup> century and 
					information is the currency of the 21<sup>st</sup> century 
					(using the computer). When he said that in the early years 
					of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, he was ahead of his times 
					but now the times have caught up.</p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					What bothers me about the symposium for artists in Kutaisi 
					is that we were sent out into the mountains to paint 
					“scenes”, not exchange ideas. No time was planned for the 
					painters and graphic artists to exchange information from 
					different countries and different points of view. For an 
					artist, the idea is everything.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					Part of the problem is that the Communists did not allow the 
					visual artists to think any new thoughts. Socialist Realism 
					was the party’s approved form of visual expression and 
					nothing else was allowed to exist. In the performing arts, 
					it was the same and yet the traditional performing arts were 
					allowed and encouraged to exist and excel. I am amazed at 
					the level of performance in dance, singing and playing 
					instruments but these arts are repeating old forms, old 
					compositions. You can learn your “craft” without having an 
					original idea, only small variations were allowed according 
					to personality. Seeing the teacher of Georgian dance with 
					his stick enforced my image of art education in Georgia. I 
					know; you learn. Me Tarzan, you student. I will be different 
					with the students, asking them to be partners in the process 
					of their own learning. Nato, the professor of English 
					literature at Kutaisi State University said after one of my 
					lectures, “It is interesting to see you teach. We are not 
					used to your methods. It is refreshing. There is no lack of 
					knowledge and information given the student but you make 
					learning fun. I will try a little of it. Georgian education 
					is not based on the joy of learning.”</p>

					Yesterday, I met a Georgian architect Temur Jordaze who 
					wanted to know more about architectural lighting. I told him 
					the little I know and directed him to architects in the 
					States, particularly the firm of OlsonSundberg in Seattle 
					who have their own daylight lab which can create the daytime 
					lighting for any spot on earth. I learned later that he 
					followed my introduction and journeyed to Seattle. I may 
					have started something. He may just bring back to Georgia 
					new ideas in daylight lighting technology to create future 
					buildings. Information is still the way to the future. When 
					I ask him, as he is a professor at Tbilisi State Academy of 
					Fine Arts as I am, “When my classes in the second semester 
					start?”, he told me, “About February 1<sup>st</sup> or March 
					15<sup>th</sup>.” He said it with a straight face and it was 
					all that I could do not to laugh. Yet, I learned later that 
					it was a ridiculous statement and absolutely correct. At 
					that time, I thanked him and though, “OK, all I need to 
					teach is a place, students and a time. If the Academy makes 
					its schedule of opening second semester on the temperature 
					of winter and has no electricity and therefore no heat, I 
					will move to a place that has heat and space.” The Academy 
					did not start classes until March 1<sup>st</sup> and 
					therefore I taught all of February at the National State 
					University, letting my Academy students know where I was 
					lecturing and allowing them to come. Each class had over 
					seventy students.</p>

					I taught my class on museum studies at the Academy today. We 
					circle the desks which appeared to have never been moved 
					from their authoritarian positions facing the front of the 
					classroom. We build a board of trustees, make policies, 
					recruit new board members and do other American Museum 
					Association ideas. What is for me a way of life is all new 
					to them. The Director of the Art History Department, who was 
					sitting in, asked, “Do museums that are supported by the 
					government have this kind of system?” My answer was, “Yes.” 
					“Do art galleries?” “No,” I said, “businesses do not have to 
					have American Association of Museum’s standards or 
					accreditation.” “What is accreditation?” It was at this 
					point that I knew that some complex ideas had to been 
					explained after finding any close equivalent in Georgian 
					life. Our ideas are tied so strongly into American freedom, 
					democracy and individual rights that it is hard to explain 
					them here. All decisions for years have come from the top 
					down, not with the people on the bottom up. The daughter of 
					a good Georgian friend went to have minor operation. She has 
					lived in America for her high school years. Now, she is 
					annoyed that the doctors would not tell her what they were 
					doing. She told them it was her body. One doctor said, “For 
					now, it is ours.”</p>

					My techniques of teaching have been perfected over the years 
					by taking time off to learn how to get across material in 
					short segment (by becoming a disc jockey for a time) and how 
					to use my voice as an instrument of learning (acting in 
					plays to learn projection). I use the whole space of the 
					classroom, an idea that is revolutionary here. I break the 
					imaginary plane between teacher and student all the time. 
					For me, using the space that normally causes a separation 
					between the teacher and the student is a way to identify 
					with the student and his or her needs. The Georgian system 
					is to stay in front and tell the students information (which 
					is&nbsp; out of date by the time they get out of school). Their 
					job is to memorize, not think. I make them work at thinking 
					and, eventually, they enjoy learning. Also I use humor to 
					get across major points. An individual who can laugh is open 
					to new ideas. I enjoy teaching and these students are so 
					appreciative.</p>

					“Who has me now?” I ask some days. Who owns me for this 
					precious second or minute? The car, the computer, a promise 
					makes “To have or have not” the question of the day. Some

					the keys to the apartment?” is more complex when you begin 
					to think about who has what and when. Do I have a name or 
					does my name own me? It is a puzzlement. Have you ever 
					answered questions to an insurance form where they want your 
					medical card number and the company, your social security 
					number, your telephone number and your address before they 
					ever try to learn who you are or why you want to see the

					August-filled trees and bushes, and another hill to climb in 
					this Russian-made chariot. The moment is held as long as it 
					can be held. It is extended in time by the joy of the scene 
					with Georgian churches perched on the edge of the hills.. 
					The serene horizontal of the far bank, the water that dances 
					with light and soft color fills my being. I have done it. I

					minds of the participants alive as their bodies were 
					oppressed by outside forces. What is happening is an 
					internal stagnation of the tradition. It should have some

					the supra should be honoring guest, country and family, the

					honor the tamada, since this is a demanding and taxing job, 
					but the middle should be free to celebrate ideas, to build 
					upon themes, to let the creative minds of the participants 
					fly and soar. That is how it began. That is how it should

					That night, I work on a new series of paintings called

					do not work alongside students. One young girl meets me and 
					shows me where I am to work. It is a studio in the 19<sup>th</sup> 
					century style (I am saying that often but it is true). It is 
					a large room with a skylight, dirty floors (I will never 
					bring my jacket or red bag again), high Gothic arched 
					ceilings. For the painters in the class, their palettes are 
					arranged in a Renaissance style from white to yellow to red 
					to…etc. until black. The painting is also locked into the 
					last century. The drawing is Renaissance. Well done, but it 
					is Renaissance and classical (not a bad tradition if the 
					students are also allowed to do 20<sup>th</sup> century 
					ideas). It is interesting to see how the students react to 
					my drawing style. I call it “cluster thinking”. They have 
					been taught to build the figure from proportions and basic 
					forms. For me, all this is in my head and not on the page. I 
					try to find the clusters that make up the heart of the 
					experience of seeing. It is how the human body begins as a 
					cluster of lines and forms. All else can be drawn around the 
					key cluster to the vision. You have to have Renaissance 
					proportions but it is internal and not on the page. You know

					I have a good session with the gallery directors. It is an

					Tonight, in what the Georgians call “old town”, we attend

					Georgi Alexi-Meskhishvili is the strongest contemporary art 
					that I have seen. He is now teaching at my alma mater, 
					Dartmouth College, but for years he was the senior set 
					designer for the Opera House and the National Theater. What 
					shows so strongly is his sense of play with images, words 
					and surface. Another art exhibition, by an artist named 
					Levon, shows art work from the 1980s that had been banned by 
					the Communists. It also is strong in content and execution.

					am back to the place in my life where I wake at night, 
					visualize a whole or part section of a painting, and paint 
					it in my mind, the colors materializing as I put them in 
					place. There is a study of a woman who has been tested to 
					hold 10,000 bits of visual information in her mind and can 
					recall any segment. I can walk through a gallery quickly, 
					almost running by the paintings, and later tell you all 
					about the colors, lines, brushstrokes, forms and content of 
					the works. It takes me about two walk-throughs to collect 
					this visual information. Sometimes years later I can walk 
					again through that same exhibit in my mind’s eye and tell 
					you where each painting was placed and how it was painted. I 
					have never thought much about this ability because it has 
					always been a part of my sight but now I understand that it 
					is a gift. School never rewarded visualization except in art

					three fates (the cruel masked sisters who spin our destiny 
					and cut the thread of our lives). The four masks are worn 
					first by the fates, then Medea, then the dancers, then put 
					away. The dancer of destiny and Medea look into a momentary 
					tableau. An aged masked figure appears, carried by the youth

					come again, exchanging symbols of Medea’s crime against her

					I have found what I sought, a tool to teach arts management

					the others are players. Today I use the supra for them to 
					begin to think of “how to find grant funds”. The idea of 
					sweat labor to balance a request for funds from a foundation 
					is totally foreign to the student’s thinking. The Communists 
					and their parents gave but never asked what was needed. To 
					analyze strengths and weaknesses and then to pursue only the 
					strength is again a new concept. Getting money through the 
					grant process is second nature to me. I do not need to think 
					about it. I just do it. I start with what is needed, work up 
					the budget and then proceed to the narrative. Teaching these 
					concepts is so hard because asking for funds is new and I

					I was teaching at a state museum to gallery owners and 
					non-governmental agencies when the great October march on 
					the Parliament Building came. The museum was closed with us 
					in it.&nbsp; Most Georgians stayed away from the marchers and 
					that area (most of my students did not), but after the 
					second day it became normal to adjust to “no government” 
					(since members of the Parliament resigned after the 
					protests). One of my friends in the States asked by email, 
					“What is it like living abroad now?” I wrote back, “Tense 
					but normal (and not tense all the time).” The one thing that 
					is comforting is the knowledge that these are the warmest, 
					friendliest, most hospitable people in the world. Situations 
					are situations. There is never a totally safe time in the 
					modern world. You make decisions based upon your priorities. 
					One of our priorities is the refusal to live in fear. Tense, 
					yes, but normal.</p>

					Halfway I realized that we were going in the wrong 
					direction. There had been so much talk about kidnapping of 
					Americans that I had to calm my nerves before gesturing to 
					the driver, “The other way.” I had been to Rustavi, about 
					twenty miles from town, and that is where we were headed. At 
					another time in my life and another time in history, I would 
					have let the situation continue to see if a new adventure 
					could be found but now I wanted to be where I felt safe. A 
					German diplomat had been murdered with a rock two nights 
					before as he got into his elevator to go to his apartment. I 
					knew one word for direction, “Adjara Hotel”, which was 
					across from our apartment. With gestures and that one word, 
					the taxi was turned around and we drove home. He charged me 
					for his mistake as I got out of the taxi but I did not care. 
					This is typical of life in Georgia at this moment in time,

					There is always a way. Contemporary Georgian life is closer

					my youth. Living in the moment is still a glorious way to 
					savor each segment of living, but I now also believe that 
					luck comes to those who are prepared. It is my tradition to 
					plan. From a free society comes hope. In Georgia, tradition 
					is the one thing that has held this society together as it 
					was attacked from all sides. Georgia stayed Georgian through 
					its holding onto traditions. Now that the attacks are not 
					here, traditions must grow or die. That is why I called the 
					exhibition “An American Supra”. The supra is a ritual for 
					celebrating all that is enriching in life and all that 
					should constantly be held close: freedom, country, 
					childhood, mountains, heroes, the future, play, love, color 
					and form, those who have died, icons, family, and being 
					truly alive. </p>

					walked into our apartment in Tbilisi that first night. I 
					could see Renior or Monet living here in the mid 1860’s. 
					When I worked with artists in Kutaisi in September, we went 
					on outings like the Impressionists. Reality has changed 
					since then (although it is refreshing to step back in time). 
					It is no longer only that which is outside the eye but also 
					what we know, what we dream and what we imagine. A Georgian

					“foreign-born” and “liberal”. Georgia at this time in its

					One of the first things that I, as a man, had to learn is 
					the rules of the Supra, the traditional men’s toasting 
					ritual. It happens almost at all times when Georgians gather 
					to eat and drink. There is a pattern controlled by the 
					“tamada”, a wise and flexible leader who runs the 
					celebration dinner like a conductor of a great symphony 
					orchestra. The best that I have witnessed is Shasheasvili, 
					Governor of 14 districts in Western Georgia and great 
					supporter of the arts. He went through toasts to guests, 
					America, Georgia, family, parents, grandparents, those who 
					died, artists, special persons, peace, love, women, and 
					other creative subjects (all this over an eight hour period 
					while he had to drink twice as much as anyone else). Our 
					shortest public dinner so far has been two hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

					The poverty in Georgia tears at your heart. Those who toil 
					so hard to change this receive little salary in return. A 
					few examples are: the President of Georgia makes $2000 lari 
					a month ($1000 USD), the governor of a large district: $230 
					lari ($115 USD), the Governor’s driver: $70 lari ($35 USD), 
					the Director of Water for a city outside of Tbilisi: $14 
					lari ($7 USD), and a teacher in the provinces: $40 lari ($20 
					USD). The pension waiting for my Georgian artist/professor 
					friend on reaching 65 is $7 lari. I could not tell him what 
					I get from Social Security. As Sasha, a farmer, told me in 
					the mountains: “All we have here is hope.”</p>

					A vivid image that stays with me at this special time of 
					year is Motsameta and its priest, Father Mamao. Perched on a 
					strip of land, 500 feet above the stream and valley on three 
					sides, this 8<sup>th</sup> century church stands as a vivid 
					image of strength and the determination of the Georgian 
					people to survive and thrive against war from all sides and 
					the ravages of time. I met an 89-year old priest, whose 
					laughter and wit are as clear as his long while beard. He is 
					guarded by his location, God and four “sometime-loving” 
					Doverman Pinchers. He is a legend in Kutaisi, walking 
					barefoot on special religious days from the town to his 
					oasis on the mountain. He makes his own beer and writes 
					poetry in his spare time. Recently, he visited relatives in 
					San Francisco. I still picture this imposing figure, long&nbsp; 
					white beard and pastel robe flowing in the bay wind, walking 
					the modern streets as a figure out of time but timeless. He 
					showed Anne and I two paintings of saints that he created 
					for the church (other precious paintings and church icons 
					from the 8<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> century were 
					saved by the people of his parish during the Communists 
					purges of all religions and religious objects). Words cannot 
					describe the twinkle in his eyes and his smile of 
					contentment. For those looking for “peace on earth, good 
					will to mankind”, look no further than the face at Motsameta.&nbsp; 
					Yes, there is a Santa Claus. I found him in Georgia.</p>

					Before coming to Georgia to teach American art and 
					architecture plus museum studies at three universities, and 
					lectures on Chinese art, American art, American architecture 
					and museum management at two national Georgian museums and 
					to Georgian architects, I was ready for a short vacation. We 
					decided on Istanbul and Cappadokia, Turkey.</p>

					Istanbul is the end of the silk road which starts in China, 
					crosses Tbilisi, Georgia and terminates in Turkey’s meeting 
					place for Asia and Europe. Divided by the Bosphorus River 
					which joins the Black and the Marmara Sea, Istanbul has been 
					an important crossroad for trade all through history and 
					many nations fought to control it. We sail the Bosphorus and 
					marvel at the grand palaces on each side built by the 
					conquerors and rich traders. We walk through the vast, open 
					spaces of the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, two of the 
					architectural marvels of the ancient world, on our tourist 
					days; walk the narrow streets on our people days; and relax 
					beside the outdoor pool on our crash days. I came to see one 
					building which has fascinated me most of my life. Hagia 
					Sophia cups out space so that the wall, which traditionally 
					holds up a roof, is not needed and the magnificent dome 
					seems to float above the viewer. For years I taught about 
					the importance of Hagia Sophia to the history of 
					architecture, getting rid of the wall for support so that 
					the age of Gothic cathedrals and modern skyscrapers was 
					possible. What no slide or internet connection can tell you 
					is the vast space and how small you feel in its interior. 
					Just down from Hagia Sophia is the spice market. One has not 
					shopped until you go to a large Turkish market where all the 
					world’s goods are hustled to all comers. You feel 
					claustrophobic as the street is jammed with the humanity of 
					many races and colors. </p>

					We flew Turkish Airlines to Ankara, the capitol of Turkey, 
					and then took a five-hour bus ride to Cappadokia. I had 
					researched St. Nino studying there in the 4<sup>th</sup> 
					century before she brought Christianity to Georgia and been 
					reading the poetry of al-Rumi for the last nine years (this 
					was his birthplace). As soon as our bus crested the last 
					hill over Goreme, a town in the center of Cappadokia, with 
					the mountains towering over the scene in the distance, 
					wonderland appeared. I was ready for many things but no 
					information can relate this special, magical place. As story 
					goes, this was a sea between Asia and Europe. In some 
					distant past, the earth shifted so that the bottom of the 
					sea rose bringing soft and hard rocks into the air and wind. 
					Through the centuries, the hard rock stayed on top of the 
					soft, making cone-like “fairy castles”. It was only in the 
					18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries that Europeans 
					were told of this special place on earth. Coleman Burkes, 
					who translated al-Rumi’s poetry, tried to order bottle water 
					one night here and instead ordered “the secret of the 
					universe”. He may not have really made a translation 
					mistake.</p>

					Our first night after resting at the Ottoman House, we 
					attended belly dancing and singing in the Yasur Baba 
					Restaurant, carved into a gigantic rock. As the food, 
					drinking and singing progressed, the communal dancing moved 
					outdoors around a bonfire to the hypnotic sounds of drum and 
					flute. I thought, “This is what the United Nations should 
					be- all the nations of the world dancing together.” Another 
					night we attended the “whirling dervishes” choreographed by 
					the 12<sup>th</sup> century mystical Calaladdin al-Rumi (who 
					the Turks call Mevlana) where the dancers spin with the 
					right hand pointed to heaven to receive God’s word and their 
					left hand toward the earth. The idea is to turn around your 
					heart. In the afternoons, we visited the pottery works of 
					Cappadokia, where they make the famous “half moon plates”, 
					and walked through the “king’s palace”, homes of ordinary 
					people and other structures carved from the soft rock. In 
					one house (which the New York Times mistakenly calls “a 
					cave” but is a home built by people), which was owned by one 
					extended family for 900 years, we met the great (followed by 
					many more greats) grandson of the original owner. The 
					Turkish government is making Cappadokia (Kappadokia) a 
					national park therefore his family has to stop living there 
					but he is still allowed to give tours. We sat in a small 
					womb-like room, where the wash place was dug from one wall 
					and covered with a fine Turkish rug, looked out a large 
					carved window and marveled at the ingenuity of mankind. 
					Later that night, sipping Turkish coffee in the shop of 
					Omar, the Turkish rug merchant who also owns the hotel where 
					we stayed and the tourist service we used, I learned some of 
					the stories about these resourceful people. Many of their 
					tales are the legends that grace the patterns in Turkish 
					rugs. Each morning at sunrise this cultured man of peace 
					walks among the fairy castles of Cappadokia. It was with 
					envy that I left Omar and nature’s wonderland.&nbsp; </p>
