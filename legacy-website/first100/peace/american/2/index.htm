					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					Flying into Tbilisi is a strange experience since the 
					Turkish airline flight plan above our heads reads “1:53” for 
					landing and we know from the American Embassy of Georgia 
					that we are to arrive at 3:05 a.m. Our ticket reads 3:05 
					a.m. The thought flashes across our minds, “Did we get on 
					the wrong flight?” We are not really sure so we ask, 
					“Tbilisi?”, pointing to the ground, and are happy when the 
					answer comes back, “Tbilisi”.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					But it is so dark. Coming into Paris and Istanbul, the 
					cities were filled with a flood of lights. This is in stark 
					contrast. We are not in Kansas, anymore. Toto!</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					We are met by a man hired by the Embassy to drive us to our 
					apartment. The car moves silently across bump-filled roads 
					in semi-darkness, then on narrow streets until suddenly we 
					stop and are led through a dark entrance with dirty, peeling 
					walls and broken steps. It is a concrete dwelling with 
					multiple stories, pre-Soviet design I learn later, but there 
					is little at this time of night to identify it. We walk up 
					one flight of steps, open two massive steel doors with four 
					keys, and are greeted warmly by our landlady, Landia. She is 
					in her eighties and speaks no English. Our tour person 
					translates, somewhat. The inside is in stark contrast to the 
					walk up the steps. It is bright and large. In many ways, it 
					is our first lesson in learning about Georgia. Never accept 
					the outside for what is contained inside.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					The ceilings are fifteen feet high. There is a crystal 
					chandelier in the living room. I feel like Gauguin or Degas, 
					stepping into the 19<sup>th</sup> century with Anne as my 
					mistress/model beside me. Everything is old, antique really. 
					There are two single beds in the master bedroom and the 
					total apartment is bigger than our townhouse of 1600 square 
					feet in Waco, Texas. We are so tired by the time everyone 
					left that we do not have the energy or desire to eat the 
					bread, cheese, fruits and snacks stacked in the ancient 
					Russian-made refrigerator. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					We sleep like the dead until 9:30 a.m. (all four and half 
					hours of rest) but we are comfortable, although apart for 
					the first time in over forty years of marriage. Our bodies 
					are still exhausted from the trip but our heads are alive 
					with things that need to get done in the next day, week, 
					month, and year. We stand in the middle of the apartment, 
					looking at the 100 boxes of books and other things sent by 
					American museums, architects, and artists for a Collection 
					which will represent American art long after I leave in May. 
					We sit looking at the piles of work and wonder what is to 
					come next. It is a scene that will be repeated often in the 
					next nine months.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">

					When we awake, it is to a Rococo bust of a lady, a ceramic 
					eagle from the 1800’s, some art nouveau vases on top of an 
					antique twelve foot by nine foot wardrobe, vintage late 19<sup>th</sup> 
					century. Now, the windows are open and light is beginning to 
					own the darkness. Bread, cheese, fruit, and bottled water 
					are a welcomed breakfast. This is a ritual which will become 
					routine in our stay in Georgia. I take my morning pills and 
					go to the study, which is quiet and piled with boxes. I 
					begin opening the gifts from American architects, museums 
					and Texas artists. It is Christmas for me. Surprise after 
					surprise. Michael Graves sent his book, Robert Venturi sent 
					six and Stephen Holl sent his ideas about what the future of 
					architecture should be. Holl has just been featured in Time 
					Magazine as “Architect of the Decade”. The Museum of Modern 
					Art in New York, Hirschhorn Gallery and Sculpture Garden, 
					Houston Museum of Fine Arts, New Orleans Museum of Art, 
					Newark, Albright-Knox, Honolulu, more and more gifts are 
					opened. I am filled with wonder on America’s help in this 
					adventure in a new democracy. </p>

					Magda, Nata, and Georgi come from the American Embassy of 
					Georgia to tell me about my duties which will start in 
					October. I had been told September before I came but it was 
					not clear even then. I knew about classes at the Academy, 
					the National University, some other lectures and session 
					with non-governmental agencies, working with museums, 
					secondary school talks, and then Nata says, “Oh, would you 
					mind going to Kutaisi to represent the United States at an 
					International Artists Workshop where you paint and lecture 
					for the month of September?” All kinds of questions filled 
					my mind but all I said was,”Yes, that would be fine. Of 
					course, Anne goes too.” “Of course, you will be joining two 
					Russians, two Germans, one Greek, one French, 10 Georgians 
					and some other artists.&nbsp; All the painters and graphic 
					artists will complete at least five works, three going to 
					the Georgian Artists Union and two for the artist. The 
					sculptors will just complete one work to be left in 
					Kutaisi.” A thought did appear, “We have just arrived on the 
					23<sup>rd</sup> of August and now we leave again on the 27<sup>th</sup>!” 
					but I am elated. I came to Georgia to meet other artists, 
					work at my own painting, and teach new ideas. This is that 
					opportunity.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					In the evening, we try to find a restaurant that I wrote 
					about before coming to Georgia (my editor wanted all my 
					Letters from Tbilisi in his hands three months before 
					publication therefore our first impressions of Tbilisi were 
					described through images from the internet). Now, we wanted 
					to go to make the article true. We knew that it was outside 
					of the city. What we found is that six restaurants had the 
					same name therefore we choose one below the patron female 
					saint who welcomes visitors. Her statue is perched high on 
					the mountain (which I learned later to call “a high hill” in 
					contrast to the Caucasus). The restaurant is on the second 
					floor, a large room with numbered tables set up for groups 
					of ten or more. We look at each other with the expression, 
					“Did we find a hall which only caters to banquets?” There 
					were two groups of men already seated at tables, toasting 
					and singing. We seemed strangely out of place and time, two 
					alone Americans being seated at a table which was set up for 
					twelve. “No, it is all right,” said a young waiter, “we are 
					set up for smaller parties.” Strange, I thought later, that 
					he should use that word “party” for that is what the evening 
					became. We order a full bottle of Old Tbilisi wine (thinking 
					that we had only ordered half a bottle but learned quickly 
					that nothing comes in halves in Georgia) and settled down to 
					eating some of the best food of our lives. The supra, an 
					ancient toasting and drinking ritual while eating, which has 
					symbolic and real value to keeping Georgia Georgian, was in 
					full motion at the other tables and it did not stay at one 
					table. Toasting was done between the tables, across the vast 
					hall and around each table. The live entertainment was 
					professional and marvelous, soloists and singing quartets 
					with piano/organ and a drum. The voices of the singers 
					rivaled any opera stars. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					At some moment in time, another birthday party came in; a 
					bottle of wine was presented from one table to another, 
					although it was obvious that except that they were all 
					Georgian they did not know each other before that moment. 
					Time was at a human pace. Two and half hours passed 
					enjoyably, listening and eating. Then a major figure came 
					into the room, passed from table to table, surrounded by his 
					subordinates, and slipped away as a whisper in the joy of 
					the night. Anne nudged me and said, “Godfather”. We finished 
					the last of our wine, ate the last delicious morsel of food, 
					prepared to leave when a new bottle of wine of Old Tbilisi 
					Red was presented from a man at the table in the corner. We 
					blew each other kisses, a universal symbol that transcends 
					spoken language, and settled back for a longer evening. We 
					had never drunk two bottles of wine at one meal.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					Later I found a waiter who spoke some English, got some 
					Xerox paper to draw on, went over to our host’s table and 
					drew his portrait. He had a strong, robust smiling face. We 
					were no longer strangers in that moment. People at the front 
					table, seven men and one exquisite young woman in a red 
					dress, were gathered around an enormous, lighted birthday 
					cake which had been brought to the table with great 
					ceremony. The men got up to dance together. Finally, the 
					birthday lad and the young woman in red danced to a slow 
					Georgian tune. It was hypnotic; the two of them were ballet 
					dancers in their own realm on a stage made just for those 
					two. The graceful movements of their hands, arms and 
					intrigue steps were a thing of pure joy. I had never seen 
					such beautiful dancing except on a professional stage and I 
					had looked the world over for this kind of beauty. Matisse 
					would have envied my vision at that transfixing, magic, 
					extended moment. Others cut in to dance with the lady in

					When we left the hall that first night in Tbilisi, full dark

					It is Sunday now, the day before we leave for Kutaisi. I go 
					to the lot behind our apartment to unload our trash cans 
					into the four large containers. I just make it in time as 
					the garage truck is loading. The men are so courteous and 
					helpful. I have two loads of empty boxes and they help me. 
					They carry the loads and somehow communicate that “Is that 
					all?” As I walk back to the second floor, six men work on a 
					disassembled motor, another dressed as a chef unloads fresh 
					meat from the trunk of his car and cuts it on a large tree 
					cross section, and two boys play war games with toy machine 
					guns and a toy rifle. Each bobs his head, “Good morning,” 
					except the boys who are winning their own imaginary war. 
					Later, I find that the taxi drivers are tolerant of 
					“non-Georgians”. I give them another address for one of the 
					six restaurants with the same name and they try to make out 
					where we want to go. None speak English. We speak no 
					Georgian. One driver went in the opposite direction at first 
					until he realized his mistake (or our mistake in writing the 
					address) and still we were charged the normal 5 lari ($2.50 
					USD).</p>

					<b>October, 2001: Letter From Tbilisi</b>:&nbsp; In truth, this 
					letter should be titled Letter from Kutaisi, Georgia. After 
					arriving in Georgia, we were invited by the Fifth Annual 
					International Plenary for Artists to come to Kutaisi and 
					paint five works of art, two for myself and three for the 
					Georgian Artists Union. I am the first American artist to be 
					invited and participate. It is such an honor and opportunity 
					that I jumped at the chance. Anne and I would see parts of 
					Georgia that no Fulbright Scholar or American had seen 
					before and at the same time live and work with twenty of the 
					best artists in France, Greece, Germany, Russia and of 
					course Georgia (10 sculptors and 10 painters/graphic 
					artists). As an added gift, Anne and I were asked to be the 
					guest of the Governor (and his wife Dea) of 14 Western 
					Georgia districts, Mr. and Mrs. Shasheashvili..</p>

					Nine of us left Tbilisi by bus, sent by the Municipality of 
					Kutaisi, the old capitol of Georgia. To say that the roads 
					in Georgia are bad is the largest understatement that I can 
					make in these letters.&nbsp; It did not take long for the beauty 
					of the mountains and valleys to make us forget our 
					backsides, the luggage sometimes coming down the aisle and 
					the slalom-driving to miss the potholes that could stop our 
					adventure. Also the warmth and comradeship of the other 
					passengers makes up for the lack of smoothness. We stopped 
					to eat warm bread, khachapuri (a bread with cheese inside) 
					and fresh cheese that rivals any in the world. We drove into 
					the towering mountains for five and a half hours before 
					reaching Kutaisi, a much smaller city than Tbilisi. Cameras 
					for television and newspapers greeted us, as well as the 
					Governor, the Mayor and other district dignitaries. It does 
					not take long to realize that one must wear several hats at 
					these international events: artistic, political and social. 
					It takes a juggling act to shift roles but it is essential 
					to understanding the situation.</p>

					Soon after the individual and group photographs were taken, 
					we were escorted by the Governor’s driver to a modest home 
					at the outskirts of the city (it had been his parent’s 
					house) and first met Dea, his wife, who would become a 
					friend and companion over the next month while we were in 
					Kutaisi (which ended up for only two weeks since we took 
					side trips to places where no Americans have gone, the high 
					mountains). That night we were the honored guests at the 
					annual religious ceremony at the 6<sup>th</sup> century 
					reconstructed church high on the mountain protecting the 
					city. Everyone walked behind the golden icon of the Virgin 
					through the winding, cobblestone streets to the church. 
					Later, we had our opening banquet which started at midnight 
					and ended at 7:30 a.m.with wonderful food, drink, toasting 
					(it was our first real extended experience with the Supra, 
					the Georgian ritual of toasting by the men), dancing and 
					singing. We only made it until five in the morning but when 
					we left the party still was alive and spirited. The Governor 
					was the tamada (the orchestral leader of the Supra) and was 
					brilliant to watch, making sure each of the 40 participants 
					were honored, had a voice and given the correct time to 
					speak and be heard. He had to mix humor and wit with 
					seriousness, music and dancing with the toasting. It was 
					masterful to watch. And also he had to drink more than 
					anyone at the banquet since he was the leader who honored 
					all. I do not know many American leaders who could shoulder 
					his role.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

					I attempted to figure out the schedule but only found that 
					we ate at nine, three and nine o’clock because the sculptors 
					needed the light to work. Many of the first few days were 
					spent with a “hurry up and wait” pattern. When Dea asked us 
					to go to the Black Sea for the day, it was a welcomed break. 
					The sand was black, the water warm and the company 
					delightful. On returning I found that I was leaving the next 
					day to go to Kharagauli with two other painters and Anne. It 
					was a rare and wonderful trip, high in the mountains, filled 
					with breathtaking scenery, visits to artists and farmers who 
					not too many foreigners get to meet, and welcomed by a 
					hospitality that is second to none in this world. We ate at 
					Sasha’s small house (no more than fifteen feet square) and 
					he gave us all that he had (with the Supra of course). The 
					poverty in Georgia is widespread but the pride in country 
					and giving to an “honored guest” is a long and respected 
					tradition. One plate is always left empty just in case a 
					guest might arrive. I got to see David Sakwadzef, the 
					district manager of Kharagauli, ride like John Wayne, tall 
					in the saddle and comfortable on a horse. I finished eight 
					paintings, after driving over non-roads, fifteen streams and 
					car-size potholes where the water came halfway up the tires 
					of our Russian army jeep, so I can take a day off here and 
					there to visit other magnificent places. The economy and the 
					road are poor but the people are rich in spirit and live in 
					one of the truly beautiful countries of the world. The 
					economy will change. New leadership will make sure it 
					happens but only because they can build upon a foundation of 
					centuries of tradition, a fierce pride in nation and the 
					warmth of a people that overcomes many adversities. I will 
					miss Kutaisi when the final exhibition opens and I return to 
					Tbilisi for teaching but I will plan to come back during our 
					year because friendships have been made.</p>

					close. I had brought a tiny sketchbook for portraits where I 
					would draw the face and the model would sign in Georgian and 
					English. I did not ask her to sign that drawing. Later, I 
					would do another. I did start a small series of portraits of

					I meet with a group of artists for lunch. We discuss many 
					things through two or three languages. The artists have 
					impressions of America that differ from mine. The discussion 
					centers on our “old democracy” and their “new emerging

					the president changes here the system changes whereas in 
					America the system stays the same and the man at the top 
					changes. We discuss the “corruption” of government in 
					Georgia. We discuss how the infusion of American’s dollars

					that “money will solve everything”. One fear that George has 
					is the environment. How can Georgia come into the 21<sup>st</sup>

					Kharaguali, Georgia: We had dinner at the Kharagauli 
					district manager’s home. Once again, the food is delicious 
					and abundant. We toast to America, Georgia, family, parents, 
					grandparents, art of Georgia and the world, the artists from 
					all over who came to Kutaisi, Kharagauli, peace, 
					Shashiashvili and a special toast while drinking from the 
					“singing goblet”. The goblet is filled and as you drink it 
					slowly song comes from it, a long Georgian chant from the 
					past. The competition is to drink until the song is almost 
					over. It takes practice and the more wine that you drink to 
					practice the worse you perform. David, the manager, has five 
					children, one son and four daughters. The girls sang three 
					Georgian songs as we ate and they sang like angels. When we 
					returned to the hotel room (kept for those who came to give

					&nbsp;Back in Kutaisi, we go to visit a woodcarver’s collection. 
					He died four months ago. When we arrive, there is no light, 
					no electricity therefore we view each work by candle light. 
					It is an enjoyable way to view works of art. You have to 
					concentrate on each creation and remember its detail to 
					compare it to the next work of art. Later, the lights came 
					on, the Governor’s wife, Dea, called the electric company. 
					The next day, we visit the Kutaisi Museum and the

					Bagdati, Georgia: at a mineral springs retreat built by the

					a soft cover, the wood floor holds together by the dirt 
					between the boards which tip up as you step on one end, the

					the mountains, there is no short supply of water. We have no 
					towels, but luckily we are learning and brought one. Life is 
					at its elemental again. Everyone says it was better under 
					Communist rule but no one speaks of going back to that kind 
					of life. Our friend Ato, the painter from Kutaisi, has a 
					gallery in Milwaukee where he sells a few paintings a year 
					that keeps him, his wife and a child, his mother and an aunt 
					surviving. I have learned that is the key word in Georgia- 
					“survival”, except for the politicians and a few businessmen 
					(some say ex-Communists who got theirs before the change 
					happened in the country), all driving BMWs and Mercedes. I 
					am asked by a reporter from Batumi, a city in the lower 
					southeast corner of Georgia, “What do you not like about 
					Georgia?” I sidestep the question by asking her, “What do 
					you not like?” The young highly-educated reporter says, “The 
					bad roads, no electricity, no water, no hope at times, and 
					my salary, 30 lari a month. How can anyone live on $15.00

					In the 20 days that we have been in Georgia, the electricity 
					has been off for ten days, no water for seven and no gas for 
					four. Here in the mountain region of Bagdati, a mineral 
					water resort (since most Georgians cannot afford medical 
					care), high above the world, we had no electricity for three 
					days. There is no email or internet and all cell phones do 
					not work at this height. One can call out but the line for 
					the one telephone is prohibitive. Therefore last night when 
					the lights went on and the candles were put away, a cheer 
					went up from the hundreds in the dining hall. Later we went 
					up to view the one television (the language was Georgian of 
					course) and I saw in horror the image of the burning, 
					collapsed and torn twin towers of the World Trade Center. 
					The image was clear and understandable, although the only 
					word that I understood in the Georgian subtitles was 
					“terrorists”. (some words bridge both languages).&nbsp; I watched 
					the images from the universal screen, the television, and 
					found the anger rising within me. All I knew was that some 
					terrorists had attacked my country (two cities, New York and 
					Washington) with the weapons of international terrorists: 
					fear and violence. It was planned for maximum television 
					coverage and maximum emotional impact.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					I did not sleep much that night, replaying the images in 
					same manner that that the fourteen-inch screen had done 
					earlier. The strike on the twin symbols of America’s 
					economic power had been high up, telling us that no place is 
					safe now. Still not sleeping, I reviewed the two pieces of 
					information and thought that I might not get more data if 
					the pattern of no electricity continued (it did). My major 
					thought in the night, so far from America, was: “We cannot 
					allow these fanatics of fear to change our way of life, the 
					freedom that so many through the years had died to defend”. 
					One of our strongest weapons is our freedom itself. They 
					attacked our basic resources: world trade and business, our 
					symbol of Democracy (Washington) and our elected and 
					military leadership. We may not be free from caution or 
					safeguards but we can be free not to choose fear as a 
					response. My Georgian companion asked, “Why did your country 
					not kill the terrorists, wherever they hide, before they 
					acted?” My Georgian was poor and his English was not up to 
					my complicated attempt at an answer. In the middle of the 
					night later, I not only wanted to wipe out the leader behind 
					this act of violence but wipe out the fanatics’ names - no 
					identity for history, no recognition and certainly no 
					television prime time. George Orwell taught us that those 
					who write history create history. We Americans hold 
					individual life and property as a precious gift. We are 
					shocked at those who throw away life as if it does not 
					matter. It is strange having only bits and pieces of news, 
					or worse no news since the electricity is always 
					questionable. As a people and society, Americans have 
					instant everything, including more news than our minds can 
					handle. Here, I have minimal or none. And when it does come, 
					it is through limited translation.</p>

					In the midst of a long, dark night, I asked myself: “What 
					can I do as an American abroad to support our belief in 
					democracy and freedom?” The answer was swift and clear. I 
					came to Georgia to tell others about America, especially 
					American art and architecture. Right now, in the mountains, 
					I am the American representative at an International Plenary 
					of artists from many nations. I will paint with the 
					brightest, strongest colors that my freedom allows. I will 
					not give in to black and bright red, death and blood. </p>

					Later, many Georgians came up to Anne and me, touched their 
					hearts and said, “Sorry”, one of the few words in English 
					they knew. I replied, “Thank you very much,” one of the few 
					phrases in Georgian I had learned. Here, a people with so 
					little extend to me- the only symbol of America in these 
					remote mountains- their sorrow on our national loss. I am 
					moved deeply. After a long wait and help from a Georgian 
					artist, I talked with the US Embassy about our safety and 
					was told to stay in the mountains a few more days. 
					Therefore, we remain at a place where there is little or no 
					communication with the outside world and the one television 
					for two large “hotels” worked only a few minutes to give me 
					a lasting image to ponder.&nbsp; I would say for all of us to

					I am reading Edward Hall’s “Beyond Culture”. It should be

					Again, back in Kutaisi, we attend a Georgian play. The 
					dancing and singing are wonderful. The play is a symbolic 
					and predictable saga of Georgia’s march from Communist 
					“blindness” to freedom. It was written in 1987 and banned by 
					the Communists. As a critic, this banning of the play is the 
					only reason that it lasted this long. My German painter 
					friend, Claus-Peter, and a Georgian artist only could take 
					one act. We stayed the whole time. You can learn much even 
					from bad plays. I am writing this on the porch of the 
					Governor’s house, where five families live, with no 
					electricity or water again. This condition has continued for 
					the last eleven years since independence. In some ways, the 
					Georgians are still blind to solutions and accept the 
					circumstances. This real play will also last until there is 
					a cultural outcry and the blinders are taken off. Drinking, 
					toasting and talking will not change a situation of no 
					electricity and no water. Only action will make a difference 
					and that means figuring out how to obtain the political and 
					financial resources to create change. There are those who 
					see, as there were in the play, but they feel that nothing 
					can be done in a corrupt system of government. And some, who 
					prosper by the misery, do not want change.</p>

					More reading of Edward Hall’s book gave me an insight into 
					the lack of color in this society. Hall discusses the 
					working of the human eye: cones in the center which are the 
					tools to make fine color distinctions and rods further out 
					which distinguish movement. If you are being confronted 
					daily by things (automobiles, strange characters, etc) 
					coming at you from all sides at once, you use your rods more 
					than the cones. This society has always been attacked from 
					all sides and still is. Walking the streets, cars come from 
					all directions without reason or a system. I have found that 
					stopping for a red light is only honored by some, sometimes.</p>

					Again, Hall gives me more insights. Anne read me a section 
					about the Arab’s “spite walls” in Kuwait. In two instances, 
					an Arab was offended and took years to buy the land around 
					his victim’s home. When the land was all purchased, he built 
					a high “spite wall” around the neighbor’s house so that the 
					offender “could not see the sea or the world around him”. 
					That is the intent of Osama bin Laden, using his terrorists 
					instead of a spite wall, to America today. He is trying to 
					change how Americans see the world around them. He is 
					attempting to wall in freedom.</p>

					It is another early morning, just me and the roasters 
					crowing. In the east, the warmth of the colors of morning 
					begins to fill the sky. I did not drink last night at the 
					supra, a five-hour banquet. As I see beggars on the street 
					and people living on bare existence, it is hard to watch the 
					abundance of food and drink that is laid out at each banquet 
					of those in positions of power- politicians, lawyers, 
					educators, doctors and others. We have had supras in Kutaisi 
					with all of them, in fact 40 supras in 30 days. I believe 
					that I understand the guest-host relationship and traditions 
					of Georgia. As the vice Governor said last night, “If you 
					are the host in the house, then no matter the relationship 
					with your guest- friend or enemy- it is an iron-clad 
					tradition that you offer the guest wine and food while he is 
					under your roof.” That is a marvelous tradition and a model 
					that could be used for the world, but the national scene in 
					Georgia is such that the people are suffering. Aren’t the

					Edward Hall writes, “Man has a personal relationship with

					On the day before leaving Kutaisi, we were asked to visit a

					behind us says, “The dancers are now ready.” We are lead 
					into a small room, hot with no air conditioning, with about 
					thirty young dancers waiting on benches as we come in. At 
					once they applaud our entrance and stand up. We are the only 
					audience and they are magnificent. I see where the great 
					tradition of quality dance in Russia and Georgia comes from- 
					two seven-year olds hold themselves erect and then move like 
					seasoned, professional, ballet performers. The headmaster 
					(and he was that) holds a stick and is not reticent about 
					using it to show correct form and a straight back. Again

					afford electricity for excellence.” Our hearts go out to 
					these fine musicians who make little or no money as a 
					professional and to the audience, packed to the standing 
					room, who endure the heat and concert by candlelight. Just 
					when I think that I see and understand Georgia a day happens 
					like this, filled with wonder and superb beauty and tragedy.</p>

					Yesterday, I taught a two hour class at the Kutaisi State 
					University to about thirty students who were studying 
					English. My talk was called “Freedom and Creativity”. We 
					played creative games, audience participation, discussions 
					and I gave a straight lecture. Some professors who attended 
					said that my style was different than what they were used to 
					under the Soviet system. That system had been a formal 
					lecture and then a few questions. I gave no less information 
					to them but not a formal talk without their participation. 
					Learning for me is a joint activity between teacher and 
					student where the object of the teaching is to make each 
					student his or her own teacher. We discussed Georgia’s 
					problems with democracy and I told them right off that 
					America or anyone from the outside could not be the 
					solution. They could be an asset, an aid, but never a 
					solution. I was asked what I thought were the resources that 
					must be in place to make change. I was reticent to say, only 
					being in Georgia for a month, but I was pushed to say what a 
					consultant might recommend. I said, “Leadership, vision, 
					building upon natural resources, the use of the vote to oust 
					elected official who do not serve the people, the use of the 
					vote to create change in the people’s best interest, and the 
					use of outside sources that need Georgia’s riches.” They 
					asked what to do about corruption. I told them that it was 
					an internal decision that only they could make with the help 
					of their elected officials. One girl said, “Our elections 
					are only the show of democracy, not true voting.” One boy 
					said, “We have no models. How can we solve the problems?” At 
					this, I laughed and added, “Who knows one resource, which 
					could be a solution, which Georgia has in abundance?” After 
					a short silence, one girl said, “We have water.” “And all 
					over the world, water is used to make what?” “Electricity” 
					was the choral response. I told them about meeting a farmer 
					who had harnessed the power of a stream in the mountains for 
					his saw mill. He had electricity all year round for the 
					saws, sanders, grain pounders, and enough left over to send 
					it to his home on the mountain. He was never without 
					electricity. He had their answer in microcosm. I left after 
					signing autographs (a new experience for an American 
					teacher) and went to the opera house for a final performance 
					before we left for Tbilisi. It was like a Kennedy Center 
					tribute to performers but instead of six artists being 
					honored it was one. She was a singer who had worked at the 
					Met. A younger opera star, now singing at La Scala in Milan, 
					gave a magnificent tribute in song, and accented it at the 
					end with flowers for the honored guest. Anne and I attended 
					the final banquet for the grand lady of the opera. It was a 
					banquet for one hundred friends with toasts, food, singing 
					and dancing. I drank water and no one cared. It was a 
					glorious day in a series of days that can be called “best”.</p>

					Driving back to Tbilisi in an American Embassy car, I 
					considered what I had learned in Kutaisi. I had seen 
					Georgian social, country club life, the political world from 
					the home of its leading politician in Western Georgia, the 
					problems of the artist in this politically-charged setting, 
					small villages in the mountains, farmers who gave all that 
					they had to a stranger from America, and had seen places 
					high about the valley floor that few Americans have had the 
					privilege to experience. I attended dinners in a cramped 
					setting on a mountainside in a hut for one which held four 
					people, in artist’s homes, conferences of doctors, lawyers, 
					scientists, educators, performing artists, children’s school 
					administrators, University professors and many, many more. 
					We attended supras until the wine became too much. We lived 
					with the Governor and his lovely wife, Dea, for a month. We 
					do not even live with our children now for that long. We met 
					business leaders who are trying to expand the bounders of 
					Georgia through commerce. We knew judges who painted, 
					painters who were trained as scientists, leading doctors and 
					educators who recited poetry at the supras. And we had seen 
					Georgia’s common man close up in the city and the mountains. 
					We were the official Americans at every event we attended 
					(two or three per day). We were the only Americans in 
					Western Georgia for that time. I was interviewed over twenty 
					times in the thirty days. We learned about sacrifice, 
					dedication, pride, tradition and the Georgian love of art, 
					all arts. I read Edward Hall’s “Beyond Culture” as I was 
					experienced a culture beyond my own and it was the right 
					moment for that insightful book to give a framework and 
					perspective on what we saw and felt. Mostly, we survived, 
					endured, learned, enjoyed, transcended together and got the 
					best preliminary education about Georgia that we can be 
					imagined. When we drove into Tbilisi, both Anne and I 
					commented that this time we are coming in with a fresh 
					attitude. This is now “home” for eight more months and the 
					darkness is not as frightening as the night we first came 
					from the airport.</p>

					<b>Shortly after returning to Tbilisi, after my month of

					Almost at the instant when the idea was presented to me, I

					my mind was the supra. For me, it was more than a drinking 
					ritual; it was a way to celebrate all those things which are

					<span style="font-size: 14.0pt">Shortly after my marriage in 
					1957, I learned that my wife’s grandmother had lost 44 of 48 
					relatives while under the Nazi regime in Hungary. I acquired 
					army photographs of the concentration camps and studied them 
					for several years, not being able to divorce my feelings 
					from the forms that jumped from the pages. In 1963, I took 
					time off from teaching to give full attention to creating a 
					work of art in Phoenix, Arizona that dealt with all the 
					aspects of death that I could think of at the time: from 
					microscopic to macrocosmic death. I worked twelve to 
					fourteen hours a day, completing over 2500 drawings in one 
					year, and completing 169 finished drawings for Death Is All 
					The Time, a book painting (which I finally published in 
					1975). During the working on this work of art, Jack Kennedy 
					was murdered in Dallas. Since I knew him, he was included in 
					the work under the title “Death of a Young Man Murdered”. 
					The intensity of the work in 1963-64 forced me to examine 
					the opposite point of view. That work was called In Summer 
					When Butterflies Don’t Even Die. As artist in residence for 
					Washington State University in Spokane, Washington, I 
					exhibited all the drawings from these two series in 1965 (a 
					little over 300 works of art). They caused a stir in the 
					community. I decided to wait to exhibit them again until the 
					times were able to see them for what they were: examinations 
					of two extremes in life. Much of the work that has been 
					completed since that retreat in Phoenix has dealt with the 
					Butterfly approach to life and being truly alive. The work 
					since 1978 consciously exalts the wonders of life.</span></p>

					but it made me conscious of the need to play with form and 
					ideas. Picasso was an old man but in that framework lived a 
					child at heart. Now as I reach a similar time in life, I 
					give homage to this child! Picasso had taken Manet’s 
					“Luncheon On The Grass” and spent two years just playing 
					with one idea- from 1959 to late 1961. My work at times is a
