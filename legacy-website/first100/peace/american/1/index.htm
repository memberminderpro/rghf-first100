					<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just after the news that I would be the Fulbright Scholar 
					to Georgia in 2001-2002, I was asked to write a Fulbright 
					Impact Statement from 1965, Taiwan, for the Fulbright Online 
					Gallery where my paintings were featured.&nbsp; When the 
					statement was published in the J. William Fulbright 
					Scholarship Annual Report 2000, with a picture of my 
					painting Stripescape #78 on the cover, and I saw it in 
					February 2002, I was a little saddened that I had not come 
					to Georgia and been able to write about both Fulbright 
					experiences. Here is that impact statement:</font></b></p>

					<font face="Verdana">
					<span style="font-size: 10.0pt">As scholar, my Fulbright 
					experience in 1965, studying Chinese painting and culture at 
					the Palace Museum in Taiwan, set off a life-long study of 
					brushwork, system analysis, philosophy, and color in Chinese 
					painting. As a professor at the University of Guam from 1970 
					to 1976, I taught classes in Chinese Painting Art History. 
					Also, I took students to Taiwan in the summer for study. 
					With the USIS, I lectured extensively at the University of 
					Taiwan and other Taiwan universities on a comparison of 
					contemporary American art and traditional Chinese painting.</span></font></p>

					<span style="font-size: 10.0pt">As an artist, I have come 
					back to the bright colors of the temples and the people’s 
					“Hell Scrolls” as sources of wonder and enjoyment. My 
					collection of these disappearing scrolls is the most 
					complete outside of China (www.kaglecollection.com). Since 
					1966, I continue to return to the color combination of these 
					works and used that knowledge in the thousands of paintings

					<b><font size="2">July, 2001: The Challenge: </font> </b>
                    <font size="2">Waco, Texas- Any adventure 
					has to begin somewhere in time. This one began because Dr. 
					Dennis Michaelis, President of McLennan Community College, 
					introduced me to the work of Elzbleta Sikorska in 1999 (who 
					showed her work at The Art Center of Waco in April 2001), 
					invited Elzbleta and her Fulbright administrator husband to 
					Waco to tell professors about the Fulbright program abroad, 
					and asked Anne and I to take them out to dinner. There I 
					found out that someone who had a Fulbright in 1965 to Taiwan 
					to study Chinese art could apply again as a Fulbright 
					Scholar. On July 26, 2000 I applied for a museum/art 
					position to Georgia, grant #1442, to “teach introductory and 
					advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in museum 
					management,&nbsp; community outreach, and American art” at the 
					State Academy of Art, Tbilisi. Three good friends wrote 
					letters of support: Lyndon Olson, Jr., Ambassador to Sweden, 
					Jack Nokes, Executive Director of the Texas Association of 
					Museums, and Joseph Riley, attorney and man who helped to 
					hire me 14 years ago as Director of The Art Center of Waco. 
					On February 22, 2001, I received a letter which said: “On 
					behalf of the J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship 
					Board, it gives me great pleasure to inform you that you 
					have been selected for a Fulbright Scholar award in Georgia 
					during the 2001-02 academic year. As a Fulbrighter, you will 
					be joining the ranks of some 225,000 distinguished scholars 
					and professionals worldwide who are leaders in the 
					educational, political, economic, social and cultural lives 
					of their countries.” On the same day, I got an email from 
					Nato Panchulidze, Cultural Affairs Assistant, US Embassy in 
					Tbilisi, which outlined a beginning plan for my stay: She 
					wrote: “The proposed program plan for Josef Kagle: 1. A 
					course on exhibit planning and design with bachelor degree 
					students of the Tbilisi State Academy of Art and a course on 
					American art. 2. A course on American Art at Tbilisi State 
					University, Department of Art History. 3. Guest lectures at 
					the department of Expertise of Antiques and Art Objects at 
					the Georgian Technical University. 4. Guest lectures at the 
					Georgian Museum of Art two times per month on museum 
					management and Chinese art. 5. Guest lectures for high 
					school level students on American art history at the “Old 
					Gallery” and the Georgian Center for Art and Culture. 6. 
					Programs on American art on the first channel of State TV. 
					Joseph Kagle’s schedule will spread throughout the year 
					allowing for the maximum number of audience to benefit from 
					his expertise.”</font></font></p>

					<font size="2" face="Verdana">Whew, it was that day that I initially felt the weight of 
					being the first American art scholar to be asked into the 
					State of Georgia since its creation as a nation in 1991. I 
					knew that the Communists had not allow any information on 
					American life or American art into the country while they 
					held this small nation in their Red iron fist. It was only 
					1992 that Georgia became the 179th member of the United 
					Nations. I knew all this from my questions to Washington and 
					Dr. Andrew Riess, who had graduated from Waco High School, 
					one year behind Ambassador Lyndon Olson, Jr. .</font></p>

					that the one thing that I do well is “delegate” so I guess 
					that I am prepared. In fact, I have a lifetime of 
					preparation. Bringing accreditation to The Art Center of 
					Waco in 1993 and reaccreditation until 2009
					in 1999 helped me review the standards set up by the 
					American Association of Museums (AAM). I had lectured at the 
					national AAM convention in 1997 on the Bernard and Audre 
					Rapoport International Children’s Museum of Art at Hillcrest 
					Professional Development School (the kids call it ICM) where 
					I had trained fourth and fifth graders to be director, 
					assistant director, curator, registrar, and members of a 
					Board that set policy and procedures for ICM. I figure “if 
					you can empower children to run a museum, you can do it for 
					a new nation”. I had the help of the Texas Association of 
					Museums, Waco Association of Museums, Texas Commission on 
					the Arts and my old friends and ex-colleagues at The Art

					<font size="2" face="Verdana">Anne and I feel that we will be travelers back in time to 
					country which is striving to rush into the 20th century with 
					its art while the rest of us are grappling with the 21st 
					century. I hope to bring the students and the museum 
					professionals into a mind set which can handle the 21st 
					century. For instance, all that I have seen on the Internet 
					of Georgian contemporary art is driven by the “object”, a 
					19th century mindset. With the Impressionists and the 
					Cubists, the 19th century object was replaced by “method 
					thought” or the scientific and creative method of the 20th 
					century. That is, from Monet and Renior the object was 
					broken up into color and light fragments, from Picasso and 
					Braque the object was made into “cones, cubes and 
					cylinders”. In the present world, from the Abstract 
					Expressionists to Robert Wilson to Lucent Technologies, the 
					world has become “systems thinking”. A handshake is a 
					“locking system” which can be compared to a door closing, a 
					kiss, a hug, a ship docking. a meteor crashing to earth or 
					Jackson Pollock dripping pigment on a canvas to create a 
					maze of a thicket, a cosmic galaxy or just the crosshatching 
					of the flow of paint.. Art jumped into the 21st century long 
					before the Millennium arrived. It will be my jobs in Tbilisi 
					to help future leaders of a new nation take the first steps 
					into this “systems” world. </font> </p>

					raise the $9 million plus for the new downtown art museum

					happens with any new paradigm shift. We lose something dear 
					and gain something else. At the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> 
					century, we lost the extended family of the farm as young 
					people escaped to the city and the factory. When 
					superhighways connected every corner of America, we lost 
					Main Street and the downtown being the center of civic 
					activity. With television, there was a movement away from 
					the word and toward the image. No president can be elected 
					today without a television presence. The national 
					conventions for both parties have become television events, 
					scripted, orchestrated and packaged by the “spin masters”. 
					There has been a lose of content for image, but in return we 
					are given information which is faster and more detailed than 
					the past. I miss the lose of the word for the image, 
					although I am an image person and always have been as an 
					artist. I think that the word and the image can co-exist but 
					certainly image is what drives decisions. I was interested 
					in the situation in Lorena, Texas, where a high school 
					principle was shocked by a change in a girl’s hairstyle 
					(which has been accepted as one contemporary image for young 
					people in most of the world}. There was no written rule 
					against what she did. He suspended this student because she 
					changed her hairstyle to a 21st century image while his 
					background and mind were still in the 19th century. He did 
					forgive the boys of the football team for changing their 
					hair color (which was a violation of written rules). They 
					were not suspended. Is there a message here?&nbsp; </font> </p>

					(a robust activity similar to the hand game of scissors, 
					paper and rock). All the chattering children were to find a 
					place in the room where they identified with one of the 
					three groups. Quietly, a little girl touched Fulghum’s hand 
					and asked, “Where do the mermaids stand?” He told her again 
					that the game was Giants, Wizards and Dwarfs. She replied in 
					a soft, firm voice, “I am a mermaid.” Being a man who goes

					“Look, Joe draws Goldie Locks with curls in her hair.” 
					Later, the same teacher sent me to Carnegie Museum where I

					fish market where my lifetime-recovering-alcoholic

					person is not supposed to appear at the workplace. The 
					invisible employee is the unwritten law. Sadly, school can 
					be a place where we learn that we are A, B, C, D or F 
					(failure) people. The targets that we must shoot toward are 
					drawn by others. We learn that we CAN’T read, draw, write 
					poetry, think or be ourselves until someone comes up and 
					says, “Stand by me.” Everyone needs to know that there is 
					some place to be a “mermaid”.&nbsp; None of us is strong all the 
					time. It is important to learn that sometimes: first you 
					shoot the arrows, then you paint the targets. Ty Cobb only 
					batted a little over 320 for his whole baseball career by 
					playing other people’s game. We all should have stories to 
					tell about someone in our lives who allowed us to be 
					“mermaids” and gave us the strength to stand alone by being 
					always there in our minds as our “stand by” person. My 
					friend B. Rapoport (who also is a “mermaid”) and myself had 
					our parents. The man at the gym is mistaken. “People are no

                    <font size="2">Waco, Texas: Since 
					1993, I have been working to create a new art museum complex 
					in downtown Waco. I wrote to over 217 outstanding national 
					and international architects in 1998. A team of five of us 
					traveled around the country viewing the best in architecture 
					from the three finalists. Anyone who submitted a proposal 
					was sent a print that Robert Wilson, Waco-born international 
					artist, had donated for this cause. Some architects who sent 
					books of their work were sent a book in return. We thought 
					at the time that it was good manners: “If you are given, you 
					give”. There was no ulterior motive but it has paid off now. 
					The Fulbright grant has $1500 to buy books, slides, and 
					equipment for a nation that has been cut off from 
					information about American art for a long time. I am told 
					that there is nothing in Tbilisi, the capitol city of 1.5 
					million people, 80 different countries represented, 20 
					weekly and daily newspapers, 7 different radio stations and 
					9 TV companies and studios (governmental and independent), 
					in terms of American art. I know that information about 
					America is there. No one can shut out information anymore. 
					The Internet and American movies, sports and general culture 
					seeps in through whatever cracks are there. What is missing 
					is the raw materials: books, slides, videos and specifically 
					the actual works of art which is the heartbeat of any museum 
					experience. On April Fool’s Day (there must be a message 
					there somewhere), I wrote Tbilisi and said: “I am going to 
					create an American Art Collection which will be the 
					beginning of a source for knowledge about American Art and 
					Culture.” This was, you remember, on April Fool’s Day but 
					this was no joke.</font></font></p>

					<font size="2" face="Verdana">By April 14, McLennon Community College Department of Media 
					Services, old friends since I had taught at the college with 
					art appreciation for ten years while I was Director at The 
					Art Center of Waco, were kind enough to fit me in by 
					converting videos that I had used in class at MCC to 
					Georgian standards so that they could be used in Tbilisi. I 
					was really lucky because one of MCC’s transfer student was 
					from Russia and knew exactly what was needed to convert the 
					videos. I had written again to the 70 renowned American 
					architects of the 217 who I had dealt with in 1998 to send 
					books, slides and videos of their work to the American 
					Embassy in Tbilisi for the newly-created American Art 
					Collection. In late April, 168 Texas artists were asked to 
					send slides, books, videos, and brochures about their work. 
					I wanted Texas to be an important part of this American Art 
					Collection. You make a lot of close friends in the art 
					community over 14 years as Director of a Center in Waco. Art 
					is a flame that lights the spirit of man, I believe. Once 
					that flame is lit nothing is impossible through 
					collaboration. </font> </p>

					where you will be in some tomorrow at the instant in which 
					you live. I dial up “Georgia” on my computer and learn: 
					“Georgia is situated in the central and western parts of 
					Transcaucasus, beyond Caucaus Mountains. It is bordered by 
					Turkey, Russia, Armenia and Azervaijan. Its territory is 
					about 69,700
					square kilometers (I will have to convert that to miles

					<font size="2" face="Verdana">You learn that the Orthodox Christianity became the state 
					religion in 337. According to legend, “this religion was 
					brought in Karli (Iberia) by the Preacher Nino from 
					Cappadokia (now central Anatoli in Turkey)”. For the last 
					eight years, I have been reading and listening to 
					translations of the Islamic poet, al-Rumi, a 13th century 
					mystic poet who believe that Christians, Jews, Muslims, 
					Buddhist, Shaman, and all other religious people were the 
					same “in their heart”. A revelation, even for today, but he 
					was speaking in the middle of the Crusades. al-Rumi is to 
					the Islamic world what Shakespeare is to the West. al-Rumi 
					is one of my inspirations and a rare find, I thought, until 
					a group of us went to Seattle to visit the architectural 
					firm of OlsonSundberg, who The Art Center of Waco choose as 
					the ones to create our new downtown museum complex for the 
					future of the arts in Waco. We spend three days, walking 
					through the wonders that these architects created there; 
					homes, churches, and two museums: Frye (a total renovation 
					and face lift) and Seattle Art Museum (the upstairs 
					galleries). Finally, we ended the trip in a boathouse with 
					champagne, looking out at the marvel of Lake Washington. I 
					was asked to make a toast. I said, taking a line from Rumi, 
					“May the beauty we love be what we do.” Without a break, 
					Alan Maskin, one of the OlsonSundberg architects, continued, 
					“There are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground.” 
					With my mouth open, since I thought that I had discovered 
					Rumi, I finally smiled. Now, when preparing for Georgia, I 
					find that Preacher Nino was from Cappadokia, the birthplace 
					of al-Rumi. I wrote to Dr. Riess of the CIES in Washington 
					and he emailed back, “Indeed, St. Nano (spelling is 
					interesting between Georgia and here) was a Cappadocian lady 
					and, after curing Queen Nana (this can get confusing) 
					Georgia joined the ranks of Christianized states. Of course, 
					they have to get in line behind St. Gregory the Illuminator 
					and the Armenians. But you are on the money with al-Rumi. 
					One of my graduate minors was the Ottoman Empire, so I 
					became fairly familiar with him, his writings, and the Sufi 
					traditions of Turkey and Central Asia. Fascinating. 
					Especially since he speaks so clearly to many “modern” 
					souls.” And I thought that I had discovered al-Rumi. Another 
					Wacoan had been there long before my awakening. </font> </p>

					<b>September, 2001: The First Days: </b>Tbilisi, Georgia: 
					Legend seems to be the stuff of Georgia. The legend of 
					Tbilisi states that while hunting in the impenetrable 
					forests that once covered the slopes of the Kura valley, 
					Vakhtang Gorgasali, King of Karthi (446-502), hit a pheasant 
					with his arrow. But when he galloped up to retrieve the 
					bird, he saw that it had fallen into a warm string and its 
					wound had healed. Amazed by the discovery, he announced that 
					he would found a city there to be called “Tbilisi” )(“thili” 
					in Georgian means “warm”) and move his capital from 
					Miskheta. Therefore Anne and I are journeying to the land of 
					myth, legend, mysteries and the warm healing waters called 
					Tbilisi. Here, at the crossroads of East and West, Jason 
					sought the Golden Fleece and discovered instead the 
					enchanting Media. Maybe that is where the Georgians learned 
					to sue herbs in their food.</font></p>

					<font face="Verdana" size="2">We dined the first night at a restaurant called Sachashnika, 
					where we found Georgian specialties in a vaulted brick space 
					that was once a wine cellar. In fact, we drank our wine 
					labeled from amphoras buried in the floor. We learned about 
					this place from Gournet Magazine, September 2000 Special 
					Issue. You can gain much knowledge about Georgia from the 
					Internet. If you are looking on visiting Tbilisi, the quaint 
					hotel Mtsis Brali is “a bit run-down but still charming and 
					a bargain at only $50 a night”. Of course, many American 
					tourists and business travelers stay at Betsy’s, a Tbilisi 
					institution.</font></p>

					<font face="Verdana" size="2">From the CIA, one reads: “Medical care in Georgian is 
					limited. There is a severe shortage of basic medical 
					supplies, including disposable needles, anesthetics, and 
					antibiotics. Elderly travelers and those with pre-existing 
					health problems may be at risk due to inadequate 
					facilities.” Anne and I now include ourselves with the 
					elderly. Being old in this culture seems just right, 
					although the young are all around creating a new nation. 
					From the US Embassy newsletter, one reads: “The US Embassy 
					advises American citizens to avoid travel to the 
					separatist-controlled region of Abkhazia (in the upper most 
					corner of Georgia, near the Russian border). There are 
					reports of continued fighting and terrorist activity in 
					Abkhazia (and around Zugdid), including attacks and 
					kidnapping of international observers. These incidents have 
					included bombings and the mining of roads which pose a 
					serious threat to vehicular traffic.” We decided long before 
					we got here to not to travel north from Tbilisi. In every 
					city there are places that you do not go at night, so not 
					going north is no loss.. We may visit Turkey and the 
					birthplace of al-Rumi and Istanbul to finally see the 
					wonders of Hagia Sophia (which I have been teaching about in 
					slide form since 1958). It would be nice to go north. I did 
					my graduate work in art at the University of Colorado. If 
					the Rockies are the mother of mountains, the Caucasus is the 
					father. “Bombing and kidnapping”? No, that region of the 
					Caucasus can wait.</font></p>

					<font face="Verdana" size="2">Why were we so excited about our journey to Tbilisi, 
					Georgia. Part of the answer is the adventure of travel. In 
					the Old Town we wander the winding streets and admire the 
					ornate wooden houses. You can’t visit Tbilisi without taking 
					a hot sulphur bath. On the third floor of the Georgian State 
					Art Museum (where I will start a series of lectures in a few 
					days on American and Chinese art) are the paintings of 
					Pirosmani (well worth the modest admission price). Part of 
					the answer is the challenge of being the first art museum 
					professional/artist/teacher to be asked to come into this 
					country and help improve their cultural condition. Part of 
					the answer is the people that I have met in these first 
					days. Mostly, the answer lies in what I initially wrote to 
					the Fulbright Committee: “My children are grown and have 
					their own lives now. We have never been to this part of the 
					world, although our travels are extensive.” </font> </p>

					<font face="Verdana" size="2">On a personal basis, it is spiritually fulfilling to visit 
					here. East meets West. Old wakes to the New. The Byzantine 
					murals, the work of Damiane, Jemal Khutsiahvili and Archil 
					Vephhvadze interest me as a curator and as an artist. 
					Mostly, this is the right time in my life. I have years of 
					experience that I can share. I am free to choose my own path 
					and my own interests, while still sharing that path with 
					others. I will create an exchange exhibition of children’s 
					art here and share it with creative minds of Waco’s 
					children. A friend once told me that he traveled because he 
					met himself coming around the other way. It is true. You 
					examine your life in a new light, with new eyes. Lastly, my 
					own painting will grow by stepping back into history. I hope 
					to mix the rich tradition of religious Icon-making with the 
					images of today in my own work. An adventure which started 
					long ago continues in this new place, Tbilisi, Georgia.
