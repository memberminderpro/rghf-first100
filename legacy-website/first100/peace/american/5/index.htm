					The covers keep us warm. We snuggle close to use our body 
					heat to ward off the cold. Certainly the walls and the 
					windows do not. The walls hold the night’s cold and the 
					windows are fragile interference for the harsh winter winds 
					that drop the temperature each night, each morning, each 
					day. I go to the Academy when I teach and it is cold. I go 
					to the National State Museum to view the works of art by a 
					sliver of daylight from the covered windows and it is 
					freezing inside so that we do not stay long. This morning, 
					although the bathroom calls, we stay a little longer under 
					the covers. There has been no gas for a week, therefore no 
					heat and no cooking. As we summon our resolve to meet the 
					day and the practical matter of using the bathroom becomes 
					more pressing, we move, get up quickly to dress in the 
					multiple layers of cloths that are only a partial deterrent 
					to the cold. The lights go out as if throwing another 
					challenge to living in Georgia before us. We also have had 
					infrequent electricity since we came back to Tbilisi in late 
					January. Anne jokes, “Maybe we should go back to bed.” For a 
					moment, we consider this wild idea and then reject it with 
					pleasant thoughts. We turn to the job at hand, battling the 
					cold. When the temperature is low in the apartment, the 
					freezing attacks the body but more it attacks the spirit. It 
					is hard to have lofty thoughts when your limbs are beginning 
					to numb It is just too damn cold. We have endured it for two 
					months; Georgians have endured it each winter for eleven 
					years. In May, we will be leaving all our winter clothes 
					with friends who are staying. Many cannot afford to fly away 
					from the cold that blows from the Caucasus. America and 
					Russia has a “cold war” for years but they had no idea of 
					this kind of indoor weather. Yesterday, Parliament (who does 
					noting to help with the problem, in fact these five days 
					were caused because the government did not pay a Russian gas 
					company) announced that it was “Women’s day” and all the 
					shops were filled with flowers. It was beautiful, although a 
					rebirth of a day that the Communists started.&nbsp; I suspect, 
					though, that it really was some camouflage for their 
					inaction in holding off the cold. Raphael, our driver, tells 
					us about how the television says, “Today it will go on.” For 
					the fourth and fifth day, it is a lie. There is no gas. 
					There is no electricity. There was no water all night. My 
					room for painting, which had been the warmest with the gas 
					heater, is cold and unused. It is hard to celebrate the 
					colors of life when your fingers are blue and chilled to the 
					bone. And the Georgia wind does its job to find each crack, 
					each defense against the numbing frozen march of air. It 
					blows the useless television disc outside the living room 
					window, the roofs of tin on the garages below containing all 
					the BMWs and Mercedes, and it blows away initiative if you 
					let it. Therefore, I write to warm my limbs. I write and 
					draw to keep alive the creative spirit which is the heat of 
					my life. I write because passion can be warmed by the inner 
					body heat. And lastly, I write while I seriously considering 
					going back to the warmth of our bed. </p>

					A Georgian painter friend complained the other day about her 
					daughter’s minor operation, which was in actuality not so 
					minor. Her daughter has lived in America for a time and has 
					gone to doctors there. Any procedure was explained in detail 
					before any “minor surgery” was performed. Here, she says, 
					she is told nothing by the doctor in charge. That was the 
					style during Communist times but it was to change when 
					democracy came to power. Obviously, it has not. The friend’s 
					daughter is very upset because she feels that it is more 
					than just doctors not telling patients what they are doing. 
					It is a human rights issue. I think that she might be right. 
					We have no gas for days and no one, in any way, television 
					or by public announcement, tells the people “why”! Oh, they 
					play the domino excuses. “It is not our fault. It is the 
					Russians. It is the City of Tbilisi. It is someone else than 
					us.” Raphael relates to us what he gets from the television 
					but mostly it is propaganda and inaccurate (everyday is the 
					day that it will come on). They promise and do not deliver. 
					No explanations.</p>

					The electricity came on at 10:00 a.m. after three hours, 
					while businesses downstairs have to use more expensive 
					kerosene, but now we have our electric heater on. I notice 
					the pattern of the outages. It is always during business 
					hours so that the stores have to use their generators run by 
					kerosene. I ask, “Who sells the kerosene?” Another Georgian 
					friend answers, “Mafia.” Whether it is true or not, there is 
					no trust in the government, its announcement or its 
					promises. Now, we huddle in the small computer room which 
					can take the chill out of the air. The rest of the apartment 
					is still freezing. In Georgia, you count your small 
					blessings and wait.</p>

					As the end of my Fulbright Scholar’s nine months comes to an 
					end, I begin to compare the two cultures, Georgia and 
					America. The major differences, beyond size and living 
					style, are three that I see: 1) the system (only one, and 
					not really that, of the cornerstones of democracy are in 
					place in Georgia- education of the elite to lead), 2) human 
					rights (women, citizens, minorities, etc. are not honored in 
					practice although they are in rhetoric), and 3) America’s 
					problems with the elemental comforts of life are the 
					exception; in Georgia, they are the role. The latter 
					situation leads to no planning, no scheduling, no 
					initiative. There are no or little human rights honored in 
					practice which leads to distrust of any governmental agency 
					or individual who wishes to make politics his or her 
					profession. The first difference that I mention, the system, 
					is a major problem to becoming a full partner in freedom and 
					peace. I have come to love Georgia and her people. In a 
					family setting, they are a most generous people. They take 
					you to the womb of their heart. Although this is a male 
					dominated culture, I still see it as a “she” not a “he” 
					culture. In truth, the women may be one of the dominant 
					forces in bringing Georgia into the 21<sup>st</sup> century 
					and to a true free democracy. The Georgian love of art 
					(visual, performing and literary) is an asset to growth but 
					it must be wedded to a political system which can be 
					trusted; one which gives more than it takes. </p>

					I have a new story about David Kakabadze. He hated Socialist 
					Realism but was force to do it to survive under the Soviet 
					iron control. He also wanted his Cubist adaptations of 
					Socialist Realism to be seen by the public, therefore he 
					painted a landscape filled with cones, cubes and cylinders 
					and in front of them, at the edge of the mountain, he placed 
					three billboards with images of Lenin, Stalin and Beria (the 
					latter two from Georgia). The museum was forced to hang his 
					Cubist work with other works from that time. Who could 
					reject Lenin, Stalin and Beria? When Stalin and Beria were 
					out of favor with the new Soviet leader who came to visit, 
					the museum was then forced to paint black over their 
					portraits, but it still left Lenin in front of the grand 
					landscape. It pleases me to see the ingenuity of this artist 
					who fought to the last to get out his ideas.</p>

					Something happened yesterday and I still do not know what. I 
					stopped feeling that “I have too much to do in too short a 
					time”. It just stopped and I cannot explain why. I made some 
					decisions three days ago about priorities, writing them out 
					in a formal order but that does not explain the joy, the 
					buoyancy of my attitude. I am a renewed person, suddenly not 
					tired, no old, not overworked, and I have not stopped my 
					jobs, got ride of any commitments or slackened my pace on my 
					painting. I have completed two large paintings, and spent a 
					day at home in the apartment simply with Anne, gone to a 
					simple but enjoyable dinner for two of chicken, been, fried 
					potatoes and a piece of cake, snuggled early into bed, and 
					got up as usual early in the morning to write and think. 
					Nothing has changed and yet it is a new world, a new 
					beginning. I still cannot explain it and will not try. It 
					just feels good to believe that “I have all the time that I 
					need to do what I wish to do.” As my daughter, Samantha, 
					says, “Dad, you are weird.”</p>

					I have not honored my lone lighted friend before so here he 
					is. I think of gender with this candle because of the limp 
					lean of his stature. It was more pronounce when I first used 
					him for light but each night as his wax softens I made the 
					attempt to straighten him but there is always some lean. He 
					must be an old candle light, like me, which will never again 
					be perfectly straight but still gives off as much light as 
					the newly-bought, young candles newly-formed and dipped. We 
					bought this one in Kutaisi and as Anne says, “We may need to 
					buy some more before we leave in late May.” It is a few 
					dwindling days, but who is counting?</p>

					The stillness is broken by the lone dog calling to some 
					unknown, unseen mate who yelps replies in irregular patterns 
					of sound- at least, irregular to my untrained ear. In my 
					last days here, I will work with the State Conservatory on a 
					plan for major improvements. As the Rector, Manana, says: 
					“Our situation is terrible and the building is a national 
					treasure.” Since Anne and I have had nine months of pure joy 
					at the Opera House listening and watching the graduates of 
					the Conservatory, this is the least that I can do to repay 
					their efforts and excellence. Also, by going to the 
					Conservatory each week, maybe my ear will be trained to same 
					degree that my eye has acquired. Sound is the one thing that 
					they have in abundance. Now, though, outside, the rain has a 
					pattern that I cannot read with any context.</p>

					It has been raining steadily since early evening last night 
					and now it is just a sound in the night to go with the other 
					creaks, groans, and splashes. The day is waking- the 
					building stirs. Cars are now heard in the distance. The wind 
					picks up so the metronome of irregular beats comes again 
					into the silence. A dog backs and fades. I need to give my 
					lighted friend a rest, clean up the oilcloth that covers my 
					desk, and snuggle again against the security and warmth of 
					Anne.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					Days are for others and projects but the night is my time. I 
					wake again early and sit in the darkness listening and 
					thinking. Now, the barking is from a pack of dogs. It 
					punctuates the physicalness of the silence and momentary 
					hiss of a passing car. Anne found a second candle. It is the 
					same size as my lone friend, and now I sit in the living 
					room, again at the oilcloth covered table, reading and 
					writing. What surprises me still, even after 45 years of 
					marriage, is that I am still filled with the love that first 
					drew us together, but now it is richer and deeper, adding 
					years to the mix and knowing that what we share will last in 
					our children. But we will burn out like my two candle 
					friends. With the power outages, I read more and write more, 
					not being able to work at the computer. It is part of the 
					process of survival. I cannot dwell on the aches and pains 
					of growing old. You ignore what you can and endure what you 
					cannot. There is little time for thinking about the vehicle 
					needing repairs since life is precious and time for thinking 
					must be things that uplift the spirit, not push it into 
					thinking “old”. At some point, the body will affect the mind 
					but I will fight this “wearing out” process to the end. As I 
					said to a friend, “Do not go gentle into that good night. 
					Rage, rage, against the dying of the light.” I do ramble on 
					but that is part of the Georgian experience. </p>

					The year is 2020. Karaman Kutateladze walks the land again 
					where his vision started so many years ago but it has 
					changed so dramatically in the last 18 years that even he is 
					surprised at what Garigula’s Art Villa has become. It seems 
					only yesterday that the Foundation of the Revival and 
					Development of the Cultural Heritage of Shida Kartli was 
					created in 2000. Now, it is the idea and training center for 
					artists in the Caucasus Region, located in Shida Kartli but 
					moving out to the edges of the world. He had talked of this 
					vision with his wife Ana and other social activists in the 
					late 1990s. He had known the villa as a boy when his father, 
					who founded the Tbilisi Art Academy, had spent summers in 
					Gargula. It was always that “lovely 19<sup>th</sup> century 
					house in the vineyards with the tower, called the Bolgarsky 
					Citadel”. It was not until the year 2000 that the vision 
					started to materialize when the Georgian Ministry of Culture 
					awarded the Foundation, a group of visionaries, headed by 
					him and supported by two architects, Dima Mamatsashvili and 
					Irachi Vacheishvili, the house and the grounds for an Art 
					Villa. </p>

					As he looks around, the white blossoms were coming out and 
					the green/brown vineyards still give abundant grapes for 
					wine. This is a region known for its wine and its healthy 
					climate. Pilgrimages by Georgians to Garikula have been 
					going on for years because of the medicinal quality of the 
					spring water. In fact, myth states that the sunlight in 
					Garikula and the air can stop nose bleeds and help 
					intestinal problems. Garikula is a mix of myth and magic. 
					The magic comes from the townspeople and the artist 
					population. Garikuka (although 75 kilometers from Georgia’s 
					capitol, Tbilisi) has a history as a retreat for the artists 
					and artisans of the Caucasus. The original mission of the 
					Foundation was to decentralize culture in Georgia. Little 
					did they imagine that it would reach out at this time to the 
					corners of the world?</p>

					But now walking down the road which leads to the splendid, 
					renovated Art Villa, its tower still standing majestically 
					tall with the two wings of the house restored to their 
					former beauty like arms open to greet all visitors, Karaman 
					remembers the shape that it had been in when the vision 
					began. The walls, floors, balconies, ceilings, wine cellar, 
					ice house, and everything needed a face life and more, a 
					reconstruction. Students and artists came to help, 
					architects donated time, some painting and mural making was 
					done, but more was needed. Now, that work is completed. New, 
					young students, some on scholarship (supported by the 
					Foundation’s endowment), from academies all over the 
					Caucasus region (and around the world) know of the Art 
					Villa, its invited masters of modern art and its 
					international faculty of painters, craftsmen, sculptors, 
					designers, film makers and other media specialists. On each 
					side of the road that winds around the Bolgarsky Citadel is 
					the workplaces of the artists and artisans. It is like 
					stepping back into history and forward to the future at the 
					same time. Garikula, in the past, was a year-round retreat 
					for artists but now it brings tourists to the small hotel. 
					They walk the streets and enjoy performances in the 200 seat 
					theater. </p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					Down by the river is the water-power plant which had been in 
					the plan from the beginning, giving electricity to each shop 
					and the Citadel (while saving money to operate the Art 
					Villa), but that is not all. To the right stand three 
					windmills where only one was planned in 2002 and on each 
					house are solar panels which use the abundance of sunlight 
					in the valley. Most of the food for the Art Villa is still 
					grown on the 25 thousand square meters of land. Anyone who 
					has tasted Georgian food knows that it’s fame. Karaman says 
					hello to the potter from Japan, the printmaker from America, 
					the Germany painter and of course all the Georgian artists 
					and craftsmen who have come back to Georgia to be part of 
					the Garikula Art Villa success story. </p>

					Tonight there will be another grand opening of art works 
					from the summer students and faculty. Because of the weather 
					in the summer months with cool, refreshing breezes off the 
					Tezami River and the circle of rounded mountains protecting 
					this special place, the town is filled with international 
					tourists. New businesses are appearing each day. Karo, as 
					his friends call him, cannot keep up with the growth in the 
					small town or the Shida Kartli region. </p>

					With a broad smile, he thinks about how his father wanted an 
					Academy in Tbilisi to train artists in the early 20<sup>th</sup> 
					century, and now this vision of the Art Villa, realized in 
					Garikula, will train artists for the 21<sup>st</sup> century 
					and beyond. Standing at the entrance to the artist’s street 
					which had been a dim dream in 2002, he thinks: “Socrates was 
					correct. ‘Education is the fuel of the mind’ and art is the 
					flame that sets that mind and spirit ablaze.” The Garikula 
					Art Villa is alive and ablaze with creativity on this late 
					summer afternoon, one of many in the history of a vision.</p>

					Imagine. The year is 2021. Exactly 120 years from the time 
					when the Conservatory building was built, 103 years since 
					the Tbilisi State Conservatory was registered as the first 
					music school in the Caucasus, 30 years since Georgia won its 
					fight to become a democracy, and 20 years since the great 
					renovation project of 2001 was conceived. The grand old, 
					repaired structure is showing off its glory for this special 
					night. Professor Manana Doidjashvili, winner of many 
					international piano competitions, retired Rector of the 
					Conservatory, and tonight grandmother,&nbsp; is attending another 
					world- renowned artist’s concert but this time with her 
					granddaughter and this time the artist is Georgian, 
					returning home. As she looks around with pleasure in seeing 
					the Concert Hall dressed in her best neo-classical clothes, 
					she thinks: “Every one hundred and twenty year old needs 
					some time in the repair shop to keep fit and young looking, 
					with a tinge of age to add distinction”. The little girl 
					comments on the new gold on the decorations, sparkling with 
					tiny beams of light from the magnificent chandelier placed 
					there in the renovation of 1997. As they enter the great 
					Concert Hall, opened in 1943, the girl’s eyes became wide as 
					she snuggled into her soft, blue seat. Like all Georgian 
					children, this is a known ritual&nbsp; which begins at the age of 
					two or three. In the beginning ten years when Georgian 
					democracy was growing up, the little girl’s mother had 
					attended with Manana each week for the opera, chamber, 
					individual and folk music concerts. At the Opera House, down 
					the street, she had watched and listened to adult ballet, 
					symphony, and opera, plus children’s performances at Sunday 
					noon, with a storyteller explaining each part to the 
					overflowing crowd before the performance. Attending a 
					concert at the Conservatory Concert Hall is not new for a 
					Georgian child but this night is extra special. Since the 
					Great Renovation started in 2001, many of the Georgian 
					artists have come back to Georgia to perform and live.</p>

					With a knowing smile, Manana pictures the crowd outside 
					around the box office door, hoping to buy last minute 
					tickets. All performances for the previous 30 years have 
					been sold out. It is with a great sense of pride that Manana 
					looked around. She started the Great Renovation in 2001 when 
					she became Rector of the Conservatory. It was for this 
					family of excellence that she had a vision. The Conservatory 
					has a track record of excellence with its professors being 
					the former students of Liszt, Tchaikovsky, Venieavsky, and 
					many others. Lavin and Lavinia,&nbsp; founders of the Julliard 
					School of Music, sent their former students to teach at the 
					Conservatory. Now, looking around, Manana thinks that it is 
					appropriate that this unique school of music is often 
					mentioned in&nbsp; the same sentence as Julliard, ---------, and 
					--------- when the great world centers of musical learning 
					are being discussed. Now in 2021, students from everywhere 
					are attending classes at the Conservatory. “It is like a 
					musical United Nations,” she thinks. </p>

					Before the major improvements to the Concert Hall in 1997, 
					she remembered walls falling apart and rats running the 
					halls instead of the crowds that now congregate around the 
					entrance door. Before the great renovation project began in 
					2001-2002, equipment had worn out, walls were peeling and 
					cracked, the foundation of the building was in standing 
					water,&nbsp; and no room had sound-proofing on the doors. Now it 
					is well lighted, safe, repaired when needed, and continues 
					to have a successful, energized family of musicians (that 
					is, beginning students and seasoned professionals). “Yes”, 
					she thinks, “It has always been a family of excellence but 
					now it not just a Georgian secret. Now, the entire world 
					knows that George Balanchine (Balanchidaze) and others was 
					Georgian. Now everyone speaks of the Tbilisi State 
					Conservatory in the same breath as any great, world music 
					center deserves. And now in 2021, all the George Balanchines 
					have come home to teach and perform.”</p>

					A lone dog barks. It is a welcomed sound unlike the vicious 
					sound of late last night. That was obviously a short but 
					violent dogfight. It woke both of us until the silence was 
					restored. When we arose and began to go out the front 
					entrance of the apartment house, a large dead dog lay across 
					the opening. We went to shop out the back entrance. On 
					returning, Anne noticed a smaller dog with her head on the 
					body of the dead one. It moved Anne deeply. For me, it was 
					symbolic of life here- on the edge of survival. It was only 
					later in the day when we went out for shopping again that we 
					observed that the body had been adjusted several times so 
					tenants could pass. We never went that way all day and when 
					we returned from the Embassy, the dead carcass was gone. 
					Later when we walked to pick up fresh, hot bread, we looked 
					into the large containers for garbage but the dead body was 
					not there. And now, except for the lone dog barking in the

					As always, we went to a concert at the Conservatory where we 
					did not know who was playing or what the program contained. 
					Much, much later we learned that the piano concert was by 
					Jan Claude Petie from France. He played Shubert, DeBussey, 
					Ravel and Debrie. During the first two numbers, I noticed a 
					man intently listening to every note with his eyes closed. I 
					singled him out of the audience to draw. It was only at the 
					first intermission that I learned the reason for this 
					special listening. He tuned the piano. His ear, unlike mine, 
					heard the soft and hard edges to all the shades of sound, 
					plus the nuances in between. A woman in a red sweater nudged 
					by my seat and left a thin red thread on the back of the 
					green seat before me. I was torn between reestablishing the 
					purity of the field of green and leaving the thread as an 
					accent to heighten the green. Why is it that I see all the 
					little things that others might miss? It has been my life to 
					see the small reds on a field of green. </p>

					There is silence that goes beyond normal where even the 
					creaking of this old concrete building is a welcomed sound. 
					I know that it is impossible for concrete to “creak” but 
					there is that sound that dismisses the impossibility of the 
					event. A gentle wind adjusts the tin roofs but only a quiet 
					sound in the absence of any other sounds. Somewhere in the 
					kitcheon, something keeps a metronome kind of measured beat 
					but not a disturbing sound, a kind of soothing remembrance 
					of our timed existence. There is no electricity again so I 
					write by the light of two candles. At one time in my life, 
					this would have seemed romantic but now it is just 
					inconvenient. Anne stays in the warming comfort of the bed 
					but I was getting too warm and the solace of sleep is not 
					possible when the mind is alive with ideas. Now, I am not 
					warm at all. One light, probably run by battery power, is 
					lit high up in the darkness, like a square star in the 
					approaching morning sky. It is interesting with candles that 
					as they burn they give off more light, using more wicks to 
					burn. The morning sky now is a dull dark gray with a whisper 
					of blue. Silhouettes of the apartment buildings come to life 
					and a tower of red dots projects itself into the dawning 
					sky. The wind picks up and the metronome becomes more of a 
					hurrying beat. My mind says, “It is an antenna somewhere 
					hitting the building, blown by the wind” but this logic does 
					not register, only the bar sound striking the impenetrable 
					apartment building.</p>

					Saturday, I had class again, two students and two faculty

					and no one comes to open the room that I was using in the 
					first semester. Anne gets discouraged. I do not have the 
					time or luxury of that emotion, having too much to do in too 
					little time left before we leave Georgia. I will, though, 
					create a poster to get out the word on my Saturday lectures

					It is now only 67 days before we board the airplane to 
					Beijing and then home. I find it hard to look ahead more 
					than a week at a time and those weeks are streaking by with 
					a speed that surprises me. The Kagle Resource Room for the 
					American Art and Architecture (a name that I first protested 
					but not loudly or prolonged), the playground (which Lika has 
					taken over with a passion), a David Kakabadze Studio 
					Foundation (which must be created before I leave), my 
					exhibit of “Joe and Friends” (which is taken over by Nino 
					Zaalishvili with her normal efficiency) and all this is to 
					be accomplished in the next five weeks. The last three weeks 
					will be closing up shop, packing and getting ready for the 
					journey home. I have been asked to extend my Fulbright and I 
					decided that, if asked, I will come back later next year to 
					see the completion of projects that do not get completed, 
					but no more than three months. But all this is a flash, a 
					glimmer of a future decision, reality is NOW.</p>

					Definition is coming to the surrounding apartment buildings. 
					My one square of light slips back into the emerging 
					landscape of city squares, triangles and other structures. I 
					am beginning to see my painting table, not just the small 
					circles of light from the two candles. When I return to the 
					States, I will attempt to keep up this journal but here it 
					has been a lifeline to reality that transcends Georgia to 
					some universals (which also transcend America). I see 
					Georgia as a surreal landscape at times. Time here is like 
					the Dali painting of dripping watches. In Tbilisi, citizens 
					do all that they can to survive and push away the reality of 
					their bare existence, no pay for hard work, and constant 
					unintelligible shortages of basic needs like electricity, 
					water and gas. Tbilisi motorists drive too fast, have no 
					road etiquette (except push in front, go first), nudge 
					bumpers into line without waiting for their turn, seeming to 
					rush everywhere but have nowhere to go except survival. 
					Magritte painted this world of faceless people in a 
					measured, ordered, stagnant, 
					perpetually-in-motion-with-no-destination world. And yet, at 
					home with their families or at the Opera House with their 
					children, one sees a different face to Georgia, generous, 
					purposeful and beauty-seeking. In business life, all too 
					often, planning is a myth. Many feel that Americans have 
					silver and gold pockets for the asking, deep and unending. 
					The concept that I have tried to teach of “to get, you have 
					to give something of value” is difficult for Georgians to 
					fathom and “in kind” contributions matching hard cash for 
					grants is a painful lesson, not easily learned. It appears 
					that no one values their time, because the time that people 
					work is not valued in salary amounts commensurate with their 
					labor, energy or effort. Therefore to put a value on life 
					and work to match someone else’s grant money is not apparent 
					to a Georgian. As I said many times, life here is hard.&nbsp; </p>

					We are driven to the Opera House to see the ballet, give our 
					tickets and are told that they are for last week’s 
					performance (although when we bought them, we were told that 
					last week’s ballet was sold out but they had tickets for 
					this week’s special event). Standing in front of the small 
					caged window, I complain that I was given the wrong tickets. 
					A student of mine from the Academy helps to translate and we 
					are told to go to the person in charge upstairs, inside the 
					Opera House. When we get there, we are ushered to our box 
					seats as if nothing had happened. It seems that when tickets 
					are printed they run out, so any ticket is given to 
					Americans to use. Somehow, magically, all at once, the 
					tickets are for this week. Georgia is not like anyplace in 
					the world that I have traveled. You do have to accept 
					surrealism everyday as a way of life. It seems to work. </p>

					As I stood at the ticket counter, a large woman tried to 
					edge her way in front of me, although she could see that I 
					was being waited upon. Since I am also large, she didn’t get 
					in front of me but I had to bodily make it clear that this 
					would not happen. There is no concept of “waiting your 
					turn”. There is no turn. For me, it shows a lack of 
					understanding of human, individual rights. Life here is a 
					collective pushing in front of the line. Again, the contrast 
					is vast. The ballet is marvelous. I have used that word 
					“marvelous” too often but I have tried to find another word 
					and just “marvelous” fits. The ballet dancers are 
					professional, acrobatic and superb. The audience is one of 
					the best that any society can boast for in their 
					understanding, appreciation and loyalty. The box where we 
					are seated has an older prima ballerina sitting in front of 
					us. It is refreshing to watch her on center stage at each 
					intermission. Going to the ballet today has been the worse 
					and the best experience.</p>

					<b>Letter from Tbilisi:</b> As our year in Georgia comes to 
					an end and my Fulbright work is over, images spring to life 
					before my mind’s eye in a clear and sometimes fuzzy 
					panorama. Georgia is like the Roman god Janus, the keeper of 
					doors and gates, who was honored as the god of beginnings 
					(in fact, we name our first month of the year after him). 
					His Roman name was “Ianuarmius” which is close to our word 
					January. He was honored because “one must emerge through a 
					gate or door before entering a new place.” Certainly, 
					Georgia is a new place which has traditions which stretch 
					back 3500 years. Janus was the god with two faces.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					Walking the streets in Tbilisi, one sees enormous poverty. 
					Beggars everywhere with a hand out, mothers with rag doll 
					babies in their limp arms, haggard old people, talented 
					musicians, and little children who follow you down the 
					street tugging at your clothes. If you try to cross 
					Rustevili Avenue, you take your life in your hands. You 
					daily see the most inconsiderate drivers in the world speed 
					up when a pedestrian is in sight. I watched a man on a small 
					side street getting knocked down by a Mercedes (or it might 
					have been a BMW) and saw the driver yell at the man for 
					injuring his shiny car. It seems that drivers take the years 
					of frustration of no electricity, no gas, no water for long 
					periods at unscheduled times out on the gas pedal. There is 
					no road etiquette. Double center lines are ignored, one way 
					streets are just a challenge to overcome by backing up or 
					driving in the wrong direction, and red lights are 
					occasionally obeyed. Everyone drives as if their life 
					depended on the speed that they could obtain on the short 
					stretches of narrow streets whereas the truth is the 
					pedestrian’s life is the one at stake.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					And yet in the home, as a guest, you are honored as no guest 
					is honored anywhere in the world. As one friend said in 
					Kutaisi, “Georgia has survived the oppression of Mongols, 
					Turks, Persian, and Communists because at our table we honor 
					all guests, even our enemies. We greet them with wine, food 
					and an honored place at the table. In fact, at the Georgian 
					table, a plate is always left empty for the guest who might 
					come.” My students carried my bags to class. They came to 
					lectures when the inside of the building was freezing more 
					than the outside because the three-foot thick walls retained 
					the night’s cold and held it for the day. I told them, “If 
					you come, I will teach and we will freeze together.” 
					Georgian hospitality is legendary and goes back for 
					thousands of years. It is one of the tools of their survival 
					as a people, a culture and a unique civilization.&nbsp; But then, 
					since democracy and freedom came in 1991, their institutions 
					are impersonal. The hospitality of the home is not carried 
					over yet to the public places. It took me three days to find 
					their national state museum and when I entered no one 
					greeted me. And museum viewing is an experience unlike any 
					other place. It is dimly lit, cracked and peeling walls, and 
					at times viewing national gold and silver icons by candle or 
					flashlight (it happened three times in West Georgia). My 
					friend Maka Dvalishvili worked several years to create a 
					collection of museum reproductions of rare Georgian 
					treasures. She raised the money from outside sources, 
					designed the objects, began the marketing campaign and then, 
					a few days before the final official opening, she was told 
					the national museum, who housed her institution of arts and 
					culture, would have no electricity so the opening had to be 
					cancelled. The government would not pay the electric bill 
					for the museum. It was with tears of joy that she heard that 
					she could open the exhibition, but with only three days to 
					get out invitations and prepare. Planning in Georgia is a 
					daily process and long range plans are a myth or dream of 
					the future.</p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					Like the image of Janus, Georgia shows many sides. Its love 
					of the arts is unmatched. I have watched mothers take small 
					children to the ballet, opera and exhibitions that would 
					challenge the patience of mature, knowledgeable adults. They 
					learn dance, music, singing, painting, poetry early in their 
					education and hold it close for life. The supra, the ancient 
					toasting to honor and preserve the traditions of Georgia, is 
					an event at every meal where family and guests gather. Some 
					drink too much; most doesn’t. The stories of recent courage 
					and dignity by individual Georgians are too numerous to 
					relate. Everyone tells you the government is corrupt and new 
					leadership is needed but the march on Parliament in November 
					of 2001 was peaceful and orderly. Although the problems are 
					enormous, the process of becoming a new democracy is moving 
					forward in fits and spurts but still moving. In Roman times, 
					the temple of Janus was a symbol of the state of the Empire. 
					If the gates were closed, the Roman Empire was at peace; if 
					open, it was in turmoil or war. The gates in Georgia are now 
					both open for democracy to come in as an honored guest and 
					closed so that the Georgian traditions can still flower and 
					grow. </p>
