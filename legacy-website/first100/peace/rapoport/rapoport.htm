					<img border="0" src="../endorsements/notes/images/Rapoport_small.JPG" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/Rapoport.JPG" align="right" width="150" height="203"></a>Bernard Rapoport is a 
					human being who reaches out his hand, his heart and his 
					funds to help the world toward understanding and peace. He 
					has also been a close friend for over 20 years, sitting in 
					his office or a lunch discussing “How do we solve....?” In 
					the Peace Journey, he has been an important fellow traveler. 
					I remember his wise advice: “When you win all the marbles, 
					give some back, or you have no one to play with tomorrow!” 
					Here is a speech that he gave to the Business School of the 
					University of Texas, February 22, 2002.</font></i></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><i><font size="2">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					</font></i><b><font size="2">Patriotism</font></b></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The three most important 
					things I learned from my father were: 1) protect your name, 
					2) have a sense of injustice and 3) never let a book out of 
					your hands. He was a Russian Jewish revolutionist who really 
					believed that perhaps revolution was the only possible way 
					to ameliorate the quality of life of the populace. Of 
					course, he had never heard of John Dewey or Revlin Mumford 
					or even John Maynard Kanes. He constantly reminded me of 
					Emerson’s admonition that “character is that which can do 
					without success.”</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">This brings to mind the 
					definition of patriotism, which simply stated is “love of 
					country.” We’ve had some very new experiences in our country 
					that symbolize “unpatriotism”. One, of course, is the 
					terrorist attack of 9/11, but in many ways the new 
					experience of “Enronics” which should be defined as 
					“unpatriotism in its worst sense because a few with hubris 
					said, “Damn republic and the thousands of employees that 
					were part of the enterprise.” “Toleration,” Michael Walzer 
					tells us, “make difference possible; difference makes 
					toleration necessary.” His words are certainly a postulate 
					for the good society.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Some moments in time 
					have American patriotism at its best- certainly, Pearl 
					Harbor was one; Eisenhower’s unbelievable broadcast on 
					D-Day, when he told us that thousands of lives would be lost 
					in that final effort to eradicate Nazism; and then 9/11. In 
					this instance tolerance has no place and Americans rose to 
					the occasion and patriotism was overwhelmingly evident 
					everywhere you looked.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">My reason for writing is 
					that I’m not angry- “I’m mad!” Remember my father’s “have a 
					sense of outrage at injustice.” Well, to mention one is “Enronics.” 
					Here’s another example of what I perceive to be unpatriotism. 
					In the <i>New York Times </i>of February 18, 2002, the 
					column headline on the front page was, “U.S. Companies Use 
					Filings in Bermuda to Slash Tax Bills.” I always though I 
					was fairly sophisticated when it came to finance, but I 
					quickly learned after reading that article that I wasn’t 
					nearly as smart as I thought I was. This, of course, has 
					been an experience. This is an occurrence that happens often 
					in my life. But anyways, I was a student of economics at the 
					University of Texas and of Adam Smith’s “Wealth of Nations,” 
					which is the predicate for capitalism. Smith realized the 
					greed instinct within all of us, but thought that the 
					invisible hand, i.e. competition, would be the moderator of 
					the greed instinct. Well, this particular article to which 
					I’ve alluded is beyond my comprehension. Evidently 
					intelligent lawyers and accountants had come up with schemes 
					to “legally” avoid the rules by which the rest of us must 
					play. Secondly, this was combined with lobbyists who 
					appealed to members of Congress who had riders to particular 
					pieces of legislation which would benefit one corporation, 
					and enable it to escape the responsibilities that any 
					patriotic company would observe. Competition is making a 
					better product, merchandising it more intelligently, and 
					paying the taxes that all the rest in the same category pay. 
					Well, not in the legal sense, but morally, I ask the 
					question, “Who do we put up with these kind of shenanigans? 
					Why don’t we have a sense of outrage at this injustice? Why 
					don’t we get mad?”</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I’m reminded of Mary 
					Edelman’s wonderful thought, “Political history is largely 
					an account of mass violence and of the expenditure of vast 
					resources to cope with mythical fears and hopes. At the same 
					time, large groups of people remain quiescent (that’s us) 
					under noxiously oppressive conditions and sometimes 
					passionately defend the very social institutions that 
					deprive or degrade them.”</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">For example, in the <i>
					New York Times </i>article, they point out that one company 
					made $30 million additional profit because they didn’t pay 
					taxes. Now if they had played by the same rules as other 
					companies, they would’ve shown $30 million less profit 
					because the payment of what they really owe. Guess what: 
					Their stock sells at a much higher price because they are 
					taking advantage of what I call an “Enronic” approach. At 
					least, such companies should have the courtesy and be 
					required to show what their earnings would be if they were 
					paying on the same basis as their competitors. In the <i>New 
					York Time </i>article it is pointed out that one corporation 
					saved $400 million in taxes? That’s reduction! Reducing 
					taxes can really be a meaningful objective if these groups 
					to which I’ve referred to were truly patriotic. All these 
					companies do to avoid these taxes is to have an office in 
					Bermuda or the Cayman’s or some other island, and they can 
					obtain this advantage. As ridiculous as it may sound, a 
					company with one of these offices in Bermuda, for example, 
					can borrow money from its Bermuda account, charge out the 
					interest it pays, reducing their taxes in the United States. 
					Let’s be quickly reminded that there is no tax on the 
					interest earned by the Bermuda parent. So you have injustice 
					compounded as a result of this tax avoidance scheme. The 
					U.S. Treasury has to borrow money, sell bonds, and you know 
					who buys them? These same companies! Guess what! The 
					interest they have received on their bonds is a result of 
					their Bermuda office that will not be taxable. It’s a 
					vicious circle! Where, oh where, is that sense of outrage to 
					which my father alluded?</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><i><font size="2">One day in 1988, in a 
					park in Waco, Texas, Rapoport told a gathering of citizens 
					that “Taxes are the price that we pay for our freedom!” Many 
					times at our lunches in the years since that day, he has 
					said, “Freedom and patriotism are the cornerstones of peace 
					in this world.”</font></i></p>
