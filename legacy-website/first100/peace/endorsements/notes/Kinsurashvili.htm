					American artist, who arrived in Tbilisi under a Fulbright 
					Program, Mr. Roger Colombik demonstrated to his Georgian 
					students at one lecture a work created by the Japanese 
					artist, Yukinori Yanagi. This is a large size assemblage, 
					entitled “America,” representing flags of different 
					countries. The flags are made of color sand and are placed 
					in a plastic cover. In between the flags ants are moving 
					freely. In accord with the flags they are drifting 
					unhampered from, say, Canada to Hungary, from Peru to 
					Sweden, from Morocco to China, etc. The artist emphasized 
					that the more we move about and migrate, the more we 
					resemble one another. On the one hand, this is dangerous, 
					for while moving from one place to another we lose our 
					cultural identity. On the other hand, this is useful if we 
					consider that while moving about we enrich one another. My 
					article relates to the enrichment rather than the opposite.</font></p>

					<font face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times" size="2">What 
					could relate, for instance, abstract compositions, created 
					by the off-springs of different continents – a European Pit 
					Mondrian and an American Jackson Pollock to Afro-American 
					tradition? At one glance <span lang="RU">there seems to be 
					no relation, but from decoding these lines and in</span>-<span lang="RU">wrought 
					rhythms, or, as a culturologist would say, during 
					deconstruction, the ant track will bring us </span>to jazz, 
					which was created by black Americans.</font></p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					<font face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times" size="2">Mondrian 
					was an externally and internally strictly organized northern 
					Protestant. In his studio everything was as clear and 
					rigorously organized, as were his geometrical compositions. 
					Nothing broke the outward symmetry except for one thing 
					which was a novelty at that time – a gramophone. Mondrian 
					listened to jazz melodies played on it. He himself was also 
					a wonderful dancer. Thus, partially under the influence of 
					jazz, Neoplasticism evolved. Neoplasticism is one of the 
					most noteworthy trend of Modern Art. It had a great 
					influence on architecture and design. Yves Saint Loran 
					adjusted these compositions to women, and it was jazz which 
					breathed life into them, as Mondrian’s compositions develop 
					dynamism interwoven in jazz. The symmetry of his lines, 
					notwithstanding their austerity, is never dead and stiff, 
					but, like jazz, is dynamic and full of life.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					<font face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					<font face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times" size="2">In 1940 
					Mondrian went to New York – the city of his life-long 
					dreams. This city imparted even more dynamism to his 
					compositions. At that time he created compositions on a New 
					York theme and his famous canvas “Broadway, Boogie-Woogie”. 
					In that period a new artistic style was emerging in New 
					York, headed by Jackson Pollock. When Mondrian saw his work, 
					he told Peggy Guggenheim, Pollock’s future dealer, that it 
					was the best work of art in recent years. When in 1940ies 
					Jackson Pollock laid a canvas on the floor and proceeded 
					with creation of his abstractions by splashing colors, what 
					was he listening to? Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Billie 
					Holiday, Duke Ellington. Sometimes he played his music so 
					loudly that his friend Lee Krasner was ready to climb to the 
					roof to escape music.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					<font face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					<font face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times" size="2">Mondrian 
					and Pollock, both at different times and separately, were 
					nourishing on Cubism, and it is not surprising that Cubism 
					and Picasso bring us to African art, specifically African 
					sculpture, again. No one knows whether this trend would have 
					emerged in 1906 had Picasso not seen African sculptures in 
					1906 in Trocadero Museum in Paris. Thanks to these exotic 
					creations, he has penetrated into the depths of form and 
					content. Picasso attained the goal he had been seeking. His 
					eyes opened to the “simplicity” of beauty. Almost ornamental 
					simplicity of form, line, characterizing African ritual 
					statues, originates from their symbolic nature. Form is 
					simplified in order to show deep content (with the desire to 
					normalize interrelations with cosmos) rather than opposite. 
					Later all that the primitive man had attained instinctively 
					was turned by Abstract Art into the product of cognition. 
					Symmetry and rhythm, spelt out in abstract works, are also 
					strongly felt in jazz. Jazz makes feelings abstract. And if 
					we scrutinize the whole African culture we shall see that 
					this road of alienation and abstraction from reality is a 
					characteristic feature of cultures of African origin.</font></p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					<font face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times" size="2">But let 
					us stop by Pollock and see where the ant’s track is leading 
					us. Surprisingly, in the end of 1950ies, when the Cold War 
					is still raging, the track leads us beyond the iron curtain 
					into the Soviet Union. Over there, in one communal 
					apartment, Joseph Brodski, a future Nobel Prize laureate, at 
					that time a completely young poet, by means of a wire, 
					plugged into an old Phillips receiver, brought by his father 
					from the front, is listening to jazz melodies and finds in 
					them a spiritual relief, catches a charge of freedom in 
					them. Later, this time in America, an elderly Brodski 
					recollects in his Memoirs how, thanks to that receiver, he 
					got to know the jazz pantheon, and how in that period German 
					names, still in use since the end of war, were gradually 
					replaced in young people’s language with Louis Armstrong, 
					Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald , Charlie Parker, Sidney 
					Bechet, Django Reinhardt and others. The manner they walked 
					also changed. In the poet’s words their bodies, constrained 
					under the pressure of collectivism, gradually came to life 
					and started to move under swing melodies. In his Memoirs<span lang="RU"> 
					(</span>“Trofejnoe”, 1986) he recollects how he, a 15-16 
					years-old boy, overheard in 1955-56 in one dirty industrial 
					suburb of Leningrad Ella Fitzgerald’s voice, streaming from 
					a window; how the boys of his generation were collecting 
					transparent records with jazz music, which could be bought 
					only illicitly, from individual sellers. He remarks that all 
					the above stated promoted the process of destalinization 
					much better than Khruschev’s all speeches, delivered at the 
					20<sup>th</sup> CPSU Congress and after it.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					<font face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					<font face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times" size="2">Similar 
					opinion is expressed by a Georgian composer Gia Qancheli in 
					a documentary dedicated to the poet. He says that he got to 
					love music thanks to the film “A Sunny Valley Serenade”, 
					that his generation was nourished on jazz melodies performed 
					by Glenn Miller’s orchestra. He also mentions with irony 
					that Stalin made a gross mistake by authorizing the show of 
					this film, as it promoted a free thinking of individuals. 
					The society, which seemed to be safely locked behind an iron 
					curtain, was in fact getting information rather than 
					enjoying those pictures. For them those means of recreation 
					were transformed into a sermon on individualism.</font></p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					<font face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times" size="2">Jazz is 
					a music of freedom. Quite recently an American film was 
					released about a famous Cuban jazz musician, Arturo 
					Sandovari, in which it is shown how stealthily he was 
					listening to Dizzy Gillespie’s performance on the radio, and 
					how his wife was warning him that it might be dangerous for 
					their family. Here we can also remember Benny Gudman’s visit 
					to Georgia in the early 1960ies, which has completely 
					changed the thinking of many representatives of young 
					generation of that time.</font></p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					<font face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times" size="2">But let 
					us go back to art. Side by side with jazz, in late 1950ies, 
					in Khruschev’s “warmed up” country information on art kept 
					penetrating into the country. In 1957, thanks to the 
					exhibition brought to the 6<sup>th</sup> Youth Festival and, 
					subsequently, in 1959, due to the exhibition financed by the 
					American State Department, Soviet artists got acquainted 
					with American Abstract Expressionism and other events. A 
					Georgian Alexandre Bandzeladze saw some American artist’s 
					abstract work in a newspaper. The critical article was 
					appended a caricature entitled “a laugh room”. The 
					spectators were mockingly viewing an abstract composition of 
					an American artist. This black and white illustration turned 
					out to be an impulse, which drove the artist to start, 
					underground, in secret from the authorities, to paint 
					abstractions. The artist was also inspired by Polish 
					avant-garde music, in which elements of jazz were likewise 
					strong. Subsequently in the studio of this freedom-loving 
					artist a whole series of young avant-gardist artists were 
					nurtured. Jazz melodies, in-wrought in Pollock’s and other 
					Americans’ arabesques or reaching alive to the Communist 
					block countries, were conducive to the development of 
					individual thinking.</font></p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">
					<font face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times" size="2">In this 
					way jazz, born among the black musicians of New-Orleans and 
					Louisiana, a confluence of Spanish folk music, French 
					military marches and blues, created by the descendants of 
					black slaves, may be regarded as a spiritual sanctuary for 
					the freedom-loving people, breathing a spirit of protest in 
					all parts of the world.</font></p>
