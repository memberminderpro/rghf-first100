					important that I point out that we started this trip from a 
					sky view, not a land view. It was parallax vision, a view 
					from above (like a satellite eye in the blue). We could put 
					ourselves into the place of the companions on the boats, 
					resting in the shelters and feeling loss as we had to move 
					on toward something that we could not yet see or imagine. 
					Robert Frost talks of this in his poem, The Road Not Taken. 
					Anytime you begin a journey, like reading a poem that leaves 
					holes for your imagination, it is the beginning of an ABA 
					form: (A) “Shh, we are getting into something that we do not 
					fully understand.” It is like when a mother asks her child 
					where he or she is going. The answer comes back meekly, 
					“Out.” (B) “We are confident in our skills and abilities with 
					those around us,” we proclaim loudly to the world. The child 
					who goes out now plays loudly with the other children, his 
					or her equals, in the neighborhood. (A) “Shh, we have been 
					out in the world and it is a scary place.” Our mother asks 
					again when we return, “Where have you been?” and the answer 
					is meekly, “No where.” “Who did you see out there and play 
					with?” and again the answer comes back in a wee voice, “No 
					one.” It is an ABA pattern in Frost’s poem and the sounds of 
					the letters tell us about it. At the beginning, the poem has 
					words with “s” in them, “shall” “this” “sign” “somewhere” 
					“ages and ages” “hence” “roads”, then all at once short 
					Anglo-Saxon words (sounds) appear to stop our listening, 
					“wood” “I “ “I” “took” “one”, and finally back to s’s in the 
					last two lines: “less” “has” “difference.” In this Ming 
					Dynasty landscape hand scroll, we have visually been there 
					and we understand the symmetry of the composition because 
					our bodies and life history are made in the same form. </p>

					cultures where something can be “up” and “down” and…, good 
					and evil and something in the middle and…, right and wrong 
					and present and past and future and…all at the same time. In 
					this Ming Dynasty hand scroll we have seen both cultures

					then we became land creatures finding shelter (huts, houses, 
					rocks in the sun, pagodas and temples) and wondering about 
					our new environment, and then we grew into mysterious 
					creatures of the mist, finding our way in the unknown to the 
					unknown We were honored to know our surroundings, islands 
					with trees that symbolized our emotions, mountains that 
					moved from background to foreground (as did the framing for 
					what we witnessed), changing number sequences that we could 
					decode and patterns of dots (tien fa) that we could not 
					decode in the time that we had to view them and the mists 
					that hid objects in the new environment and lead us into new 
					places with new ways of seeing the world. All these have 
					become old friends that change position and placement but

						<blockquote>
							<p class="MsoNormal">7/14/66</p>
							<p class="MsoNormal">We went to a Japanese style 
							house and looked at Ming and Ch’ing painting in the 
							collection of Mr. Wa. He is a young, young-looking 
							man who probably looks twenty but is forty. Some of 
							the things that he had in his collection were 
							exquisite. Mr. Lawton has been testing us orally 
							about style and period and artist in the last week- 
							after each session, in conversation and from 
							collections. I am now someone who is asked their 
							opinion because it is easy for me to see whether 
							something is T’ang, Han, Sung, Yuan, Ming or Ch’ing 
							and, most of the time, in the style of whom. The 
							other day Mr. Lawton (I now call him Tom - we get 
							close on a small island) said that Mr. Liu, the head 
							of the Fulbright Foundation here and Mr. Wa came up 
							to him and asked, “Who is the bearded man who knows 
							all the paintings?” After last summer, and now 
							seeing the work at the Palace Museum, I can see the 
							differences in styles. Now, my problem is to put the 
							names to the images in my mind. That is my next 
							project. I like Chinese painting enough that I want 
							to be conversant in it.</p>
							<p class="MsoNormal">7/22/66</p>
							<p class="MsoNormal">Let me tell you about the trip 
							up to Sun-Moon Lake. We began through the flat, but 
							terraced rice fields of the Sung plains. It was like 
							a Southern Sung painting, stretching out into a 
							mist, a few peasants leveling the watery-mud with a 
							sled pulled by a water buffalo. In another field, 
							women with straw hats and clothe over the hat picked 
							and cut the rice stalks. A man furrowed a field with 
							a crude plow, again pulled by a water buffalo. In a 
							few fields, the plow is a mechanized machine about 
							the shape of a lawn mower, but this is exceptional. 
							We climbed through the patterned fields, through a 
							town, the streets wide enough for only one car at a 
							time (of course, bicycles and motorcycles are the 
							norm). We passed a cement mixer for road 
							construction and had to wait on a side street. Some 
							of the roads were dusty so we (a few of us) used 
							masks to keep out the dirt. Finally, we climbed and 
							climbed. Now it was the Northern Sung mountains, the 
							hanging, towering, jagged peaks of Fan Kuan, the 
							twisting, primordial forms of Hsi Kao Hsia. Each new 
							height is a wonder and always something higher while 
							below is a deep descent into the valley, a gorge. In 
							two places, the rain had taken or weakened part of 
							the road; in one place, we drove through a waterfall 
							that was an integral part of the highway. No, not 
							highway- again, on the whole, it was wide enough for 
							one bus, but paved- a highway? At the side, a herd 
							of water buffalo was being tended by four small 
							children. Further on, some women worked with the men 
							clearing the area of falling, rain-loosened 
							boulders. It was heavy work, but that is Taiwan. 
							More rice fields, climbing the mountain. How can 
							they work up there? On story, not all true, says 
							that they dig with one hand and hold onto the side 
							of the cliff with the other. But this is just a 
							story?</p>
							<p class="MsoNormal">Higher still, the mist rolls 
							on, through, over the vistas which appear and 
							disappear in the soft distance. Young girls walk 
							beside the road, an umbrella shielding them from the 
							sun. All over Taiwan, you will see the young girls 
							and older women with umbrellas against the sun. We 
							must be nearly there- the hostess on the bus gives 
							us a cold towel to wipe our face and refresh. It is 
							a civilized custom which you will find everywhere- 
							trains, buses, private homes, a painting, 
							everywhere. And then the green lake. Our hotel faces 
							the lake- each room is a painting- a handscroll that 
							unfolds in reality. It unwinds clearly, then fading, 
							reappearing and disappearing. Three stately trees 
							stand guard like Ni Tsan’s images at the base of the 
							cliff below and the edge of the yellow water. We 
							need this touch of relaxation with the pace that 
							these first four weeks have moved. It has been too 
							fast- for me, though, not fast enough. I want to 
							get, soak in all that is important, everything, 
							contacts and laying the groundwork for future 
							study.&nbsp; </p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">Those we love are always with us. We 
					take friends along from our memories and our imagination to 
					share in the pleasure of the voyage. “Wish you were here” is 
					more than an ending to a letter. On a peaceful journey, we 
					should step back and ask, “Why are we feeling so peaceful 
					and content?” Or we do not ask this and just enjoy the trip? 
					Either way, we move on. As your guide, I know that peace 
					comes from what we discussed earlier: centering and 
					distance. We know when we began this journey that we were 
					not upon the earth but above it so distance was not a 
					problem. Centering was a harder place to find. We found it, 
					maybe, in the mists that made up the air and water. The 
					mists are what the adventurer loves because it holds the 
					secrets of the UNKNOWN.</p>

					mountain on the right, the willows and bulrushes that tell 
					of the sadness of leaving our island, the misty mountains, 
					barely visible, above boats and dark, green lines of trees. 
					The trees come in three lines: a long pronged line that 
					mirrors the horizontal, another above tilting upward and a 
					dark green line to the left. In the middle of the two upper 
					lines of trees is another void, a space in time and place

					mountains in the distance at the top, a mist that rolls in 
					and directs us to the past and the future (right and left), 
					the suggestion of shelters are barely visible at the end of

					think that they have a meaning?” My answer is a resounding: 
					“Yes. I have been a guide on this trip for over 300 times 
					and I know how it ends. Twos and threes are the most 
					important numbers. Twos are human numbers and threes are 
					divine. The number “One” is harder to find. We ponder if the 
					other numbers are just to keep our interest as we try to 
					figure out the importance of two to three.” At least, even 
					after going on this trip so many times, I still have not 
					figured out what the other numbers symbolize. It might be so 
					simple that I am missing it.&nbsp; If any of you, my companions

					the morning, moving slowly in this dance of an earlier 
					marshal art? I have practiced it, not well, but often and 
					fluid enough to feel the ch’i tingling in my fingertips as I 
					thrust, move back, hold the world between my hands, reverse 
					those hands, step to the side, while breathing through my 
					nose with my tongue at the roof of my mouth. I do not think 
					when I do this. I move and listen to the music slowly 
					setting my mind and heart to an unrushed pace. It is a 
					similar feeling that I have with this scroll and these 
					scenes each time I come upon them. I cannot tell you why 
					this specific scene slows me down and yet draws me into the 
					“nothingness” which seems to mean something. I am like the 
					children who fall through the wardrobe into Narnia. It is a 
					magical place. Maybe that is why, when I am not a guide on 
					these visual, mind tours, a professor teaching art history 
					and appreciation and a professional artist creating works 
					from parallax vision and collage-thinking, I love to go into 
					elementary schools and work with the kids in First and 
					Second Grade. Up until the Fourth Grade these children still 
					believe in magic. Artists, my wife tells me, do not grow up; 
					they just mature somewhat. She may be right. Picasso said at 
					his 80<sup>th</sup> birthday, “I am a child who is in an 
					ancient body.”&nbsp; Picasso understood the creative dynamism of 
					someone who is “ancient” and yet at the same time “new." It 
					is a combination that makes for art that has a life of its 
					own. The ancient part is filled with information and 
					education and the art part sets that store of combustible 
					material ablaze. We can all see through Prometheus’ fiery 
					eyes.</p>

					chambers which in turn lighten and eventually, again, 
					darken. </b>This section of the hand scroll is my darkening 
					chamber. I get lost in thought and meditation when the scene 
					opens to the gray of mist and lake water. And no where do we 
					find a place to rest, no where do we see a clear view of a 
					shelter. For the moment, we are the ancient mariner when he 
					says those classic lines, “Water, water everywhere, but not 
					a drop to drink.” When there is so much to see and 
					experience, at one point in time we turn the information 
					coming into our system to the “Off” switch. After that, we 
					float with the tide of the lake but do not drink from what 
					is around us. Having a void in the center of two diagonal 
					arms of trees that pulls us in like a black hole in this 
					hand scroll is important to the process of cleaning out our 
					minds so that new ideas and images can rush in. If the next 
					experience is totally different in character than what we 
					have been drifting with, then we need a mental and visual 
					cleansing.</p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">Being far away from your home country, 
					in a land where the language is strange even in this world 
					of loved languages (Georgian is one of the fourteen base 
					world languages but it is only used in Georgia), you shut 
					language out, think and read a lot (in English). Recently on 
					reading again a 1976 publication by Edward T. Hall, called 
					Beyond Culture, I was reminded of the artist’s, the 
					creator’s need to forget. Children learn it as they play. 
					You purposely forget so that you can see the world with 
					fresh eyes. Hall says, “The failure to understand the 
					significance of play in maturing human beings has had 
					incalculable consequences, because play is not only crucial 
					to learning but (unlike other drives) is its own reward.”</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">To an artist, forgetting is critical to 
					any pursuit. I have the kind of mind that can remember 
					brushstrokes as I walk through a museum exhibition. It gets 
					in the way when I pick up a brush for a new painting. 
					Therefore the first hour or so of painting is to forget all 
					those other painters’ solutions in my mind’s eye. This 
					allows me, or any creative person, to come to the material 
					with “fresh eyes." The poet, dancer, writer, musician, 
					inventor or learner can find individual and new solutions to 
					“stuff” that others have only seen through established 
					patterns or forms. The Russian scientist Luria in the mid 20<sup>th</sup> 
					century established the importance of forgetting in his book 
					The Mind of a Mnemonist, the life story of a man who could 
					not forget anything and remembered everything that was 
					placed before him. On first sight this would seem a blessing 
					but on closer look, the man was a mental cripple. If you 
					gave this man a problem to solve, as a visualizer he could 
					solve it. But he could not understand what he solved. He had 
					too much “stuff” filling his storage unit, his brain. He 
					could not tell others what he knew or saw. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">I remember in school where the teachers 
					would reward the students who could memorize the best. I 
					could not. It took me years to find ways to keep things in 
					my mind. I was always seeing the world with “fresh eyes” and 
					drawing/painting it with those visions. This has practical 
					implications. At one point in my life I built houses from 
					the ground up. I did five over the years, for the 
					architectural plan to the last nail or the trawl of 
					concrete. After the first house, I found that I had to 
					forget all the bad things that happened, all the aching 
					muscles and long hours, all the feelings of disappointment 
					when something did not come out as I planned before I could 
					start a new project. Since I am a visualizer who remembers 
					pictures of things placed in front of me, I had to learn to 
					forget them so they did not get in the way of creating a new 
					vision. I keep them in notebooks and computers for future 
					reference and use.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">I found that it helps to know how the 
					brain works and that there are ways to help you forget. 
					Monks in China and Japan repeat a phrase until the words are 
					lost and only the sound resonates in the soul of the priest. 
					As Hall says, “The reason man does not experience his true 
					cultural self is that until he experiences another self as 
					valid, he has little basis for validating his own self.” At 
					points in my life I travel to find my other self, to forget 
					the Western man that could only see with linear eyes 
					(straight-line thinking). In the West, we place logic and 
					irrationality at two opposing poles. Recent mind studies 
					find that they are positioned in the same place in the 
					brain. Irrationality is a way to start the process toward 
					logic and visa versa. In the front of the brain are the 
					faculties for perception, body movement, performance of 
					planned action, memorizing, and problem solving. It you 
					dance, it helps with problem solving or your performance of 
					a planned action. You can sometimes awaken one direction of 
					the mind by going in the opposite direction. </p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">One historical fact about America is 
					our ability to forget. We sell everything “new and 
					improved." What has made America great is its ability to 
					forget (see the new) and remember (experience history) at 
					the same time. John Robinson, the great football coach of 
					the University of Southern California, once told his team, 
					“Today we play our cross town rivals, UCLA, for the national 
					championship. It is the most important game in your life, in 
					your football career. Nothing can change that at this moment 
					but there is one thing I want you to remember when you run 
					out on the field, ‘There are 1.6 billion Chinese who just 
					don’t give a damn.’” Through shock and changing the 
					reference for their football game, he helped them forget and 
					remember simultaneously. </p>

					from Korea, is tall, slim and fast of foot. He runs the 
					relay and 200 meter dash in the Special Olympics. I went to 
					every meet and cheered him to victory. Recently, he had come 
					in second in two consecutive races and I thought that it was 
					time for his father, who ran track in high school and played 
					varsity football in college, to sit down and advise him. I 
					told him, “Son, you are faster than most of these kids that 
					you run against. What you need is someone standing on the 
					side of the track near the finish line, yelling, “Run 
					faster. Chris. Run. Win, Chris, win.” He smiled as if he 
					understood and shook his head affirmatively. On the day of 
					the track meet, qualifying for the State Special Olympics 
					grand festival of events, I was there at the side of the 
					track. He was running in lane three in his specialty, the 
					200 meter dash. He took off and those long legs of his gave 
					him a ten meter advantage coming around the bend and down 
					the home stretch. I yell, “Run faster, Chris. Win, Chris, 
					win.” I was doing what my father had taught me, what my 
					coaches had drilled into my subconscious, what my American 
					society had emphasized in terms of how to deal with the 
					world around me. “Win, Chris, win!” Confidently I knew that 
					he would. He was ahead of runners who he had beaten in the 
					past. They were friends from other meets. About ten yards 
					from the finish line, Chris slowed down, stopped, waited for 
					his friends who were running second, third and fourth this 
					day, took their hands and ran through the orange tape at the 
					line, together. It was an important lesson for me that day. 
					Chris already had learned it.. I thought that I knew 
					everything about sports. It had gotten me into an Ivy League 
					college (along with good grades and other activities). I was 
					a winner. Now, I was faced with another truth, “My son was a 
					winner of a higher order by changing the American rules of 
					winning.” He won in a win-win world.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px">Maybe that is what peace is all about. 
					All around winning is everything or as Vince Lombardi, the 
					football coach for the Green Bay Packers, told his players, 
					“Winning isn’t everything; it is the only thing.” I know now 
					that is not true everywhere. My son, who is an individual 
					with mental retardation, changed the rules for the 
					betterment of his friends, the betterment of all. In a sport 
					where winning is the rule, he has expanded the concept of 
					winning with an idea that comes close to resembling inner 
					peace. </p>
