				In St. Louis, between the 18th and 22nd of June 1923 during the 
				14th International Convention of Rotary, the delegates 
				overwhelming approved Resolution 23-34, which specified &quot;the 
				policy of Rotary towards community activities.&quot; Part of the 
				beginning of what is now known as the &quot;Evolution of Rotary,&quot; 
				Resolution 23-34, along with the &quot;Aims and Objects Plan,&quot; formed 
				the basis of what we now know as the &quot;Avenues of Service.&quot; It 
				was a complete expression (so far as Community Service is 
				concerned) of the policy of personal rather than corporate 
				responsibility already enumerated in 1916. It was at that point 
				that Rotary began changing from a business orientation to one of 
				community service.<br><br>Doug Rudman<br><br>
				<img class="auto-style26" height="107" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/history/headings/images/34-1_small.jpg" style="float: left" width="165">Resolution 
				23-34 and its Adoption<br><br>RESOLUTION NO. 34, TO REAFFIRM THE 
				POLICY OF ROTARY TOWARD OBJECTIVE ACTIVITIES AND TO FORMULATE 
				CERTAIN PRINCIPLES FOR THE FUTURE GUIDANCE OF ROTARY 
				INTERNATIONAL AND OF ROTARY CLUBS<br><br>Offered by the 
				Resolutions Committee: ADOPTED<br><br>It Is Resolved by Rotary 
				International, assembled in its Fourteenth Annual Convention, 
				that, for the guidance of Rotary clubs and Rotarians and to 
				formulate a policy for Rotary toward objective activities, the 
				following principles are recognized and accepted as sound and 
				controlling:<br><br>1. Fundamentally, Rotary is a philosophy of 
				life that undertakes to reconcile the ever present conflict 
				between the desire to profit for one's self and the duty and 
				consequent impulse to serve others. This philosophy is the 
				philosophy of Service - &quot;Service above Self&quot; - and is based on 
				the practical ethical principle that &quot;He profits most who serves 
				best.&quot;<br><br>
				<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/history/headings/images/34-2_small.jpg" style="float: left">2. 
				Primarily, a Rotary club is a group of representative business 
				and professional men who, without secret vow, dogma or creed, 
				but each in his own way, have accepted the Rotary philosophy of 
				service and are seeking: First, to study collectively the theory 
				of service as the true basis of success and happiness in 
				business and in life; and, second, to give, collectively, 
				practical demonstrations of it to themselves and their 
				community; and, third, each as an individual, to translate its 
				theory into practice in his business and in his everyday life; 
				and, fourth, individually and collectively, by active precept 
				and example, to stimulate its acceptance both in theory and 
				practice by all non-Rotarians as well as by all Rotarians.<br>
				<br>3. Rotary International is an organization that exists (1) 
				for the protection, development, and worldwide propagation of 
				the Rotary ideal of service, (2) for the establishment, 
				encouragement, assistance, and administrative supervision of 
				Rotary clubs, and (3) as a clearing house for the study of their 
				problems and, by helpful suggestion but not compulsion, for the 
				standardization of their practices and of such objective 
				activities, and only such objective activities, as have already 
				been widely demonstrated by many clubs as worth while and as are 
				within, and will not tend to obscure, the objects of Rotary as 
				set out in the Constitution of Rotary International.<br><br>4. 
				Because he who serves must act, Rotary is not merely a state of 
				mind, nor Rotary philosophy merely subjective, but must 
				translate itself into objective activity; and the individual 
				Rotarian and the Rotary club must put the theory of service into 
				practice.<br><br>
				<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/history/headings/images/34-3_small.jpg" style="float: left">5. 
				Each individual Rotary club has absolute autonomy in the 
				selection of such objective activities as appeal to it and as 
				are suited to its community; but no club should allow any 
				objective activity to obscure the objects of Rotary or 
				jeopardize the primary purpose for which a Rotary Club is 
				organized; and Rotary International, although it may study, 
				standardize and develop such activities as are general and make 
				helpful suggestions regarding them, should never prescribe nor 
				proscribe any objective activity for any club.<br><br>6. 
				Although regulations are not prescribed for an individual Rotary 
				club in the selection of objective activities, the following 
				rules are suggested for its guidance:<br><br>(a) Because of the 
				limited membership of Rotary, only in a community where there is 
				no adequate civic or other organization in a position to speak 
				and act for the whole community should a Rotary club engage in a 
				general civic activity that requires for its success the active 
				support of the entire citizenship of the community; and, where a 
				Chamber of Commerce exists, a Rotary club should not trespass 
				upon nor assume its functions, but Rotarians, as individuals 
				committed to and trained in the principle of service, should be 
				members of and active in their Chamber of Commerce and as 
				citizens of their community should, along with all other good 
				citizens, be interested in every general civic enterprise, and, 
				as far as their abilities permit, do their part in money and 
				service.<br><br>
				<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/history/headings/images/34-4_small.jpg" style="float: left">(b) 
				As a general thing, no Rotary club should endorse any project, 
				no matter how meritorious, unless the club is prepared and 
				willing to assume all or part of the responsibility for the 
				accomplishment of that which it endorses.<br><br>(c) A Rotary 
				club, in selecting an activity, should seek neither publicity 
				nor credit for itself but only the opportunity to serve.<br><br>
				(d) A Rotary club should avoid duplication of effort and in 
				general should not engage in an activity that is already being 
				well handled by some other agency.<br><br>(e) A Rotary club in 
				its activities should preferably cooperate with existing 
				agencies, but where necessary may create new agencies where the 
				facilities of the existing agencies are insufficient to 
				accomplish its purpose. It is better for a Rotary club to 
				improve an existing agency than to create a new and duplicative 
				agency.<br><br>(f) In all its activities a Rotary club acts best 
				and is most successful as a propagandist. A Rotary club 
				discovers a need but, where the responsibility is that of the 
				entire community, does not seek alone to remedy it but to awaken 
				others to the necessity of the remedy, seeking to arouse the 
				community to its responsibility so that this responsibility may 
				be placed not on Rotary alone but on the entire community where 
				it belongs; and while Rotary may initiate and lead in the work 
				it should endeavor to secure the cooperation of all other 
				organizations that ought to be interested and should seek to 
				give them full credit, even minimizing the credit to which the 
				Rotary Club itself is entitled.<br><br>(g) Activities, which 
				enlist the individual efforts of all Rotarians generally are 
				more in accord with the genius of Rotary than those requiring 
				only the mass action of the club, because the objective 
				activities of the Rotary club should be regarded only as 
				laboratory experiments designed to train members of a Rotary 
				club in Service.<br><br>Also see a 1949 editorial referencing
