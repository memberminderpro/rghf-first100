 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Hills</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> when the lady driver

				One of my favourite films, a great English film from 1985, is

				Norwich</st1:City>, in the east of <st1:country-region

				speech (left early in the film by John on a train) starts with 
				John saying Who would have expected a headmaster from a very 
				ordinary school to be standing here today<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
				</span>Before arriving in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

				</span>Robyn and Marifleur send their best wishes to everyone

				Teacher of the year competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

				&nbsp;</span>I lent the head teacher my copy of the film for her to

				</span>Similarly to the film, on the way to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Norwich</st1:place></st1:City> I was stopped by a 
				policeman. Perhaps I was travelling a little fast. However, I

				the post-office and the railroad station were important centers

				important railway news up and down the line; even the names of 
				the brakemen and the engineers were known to us. We knew whether
