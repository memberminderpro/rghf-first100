        conversation which Paul VI inaugurated with you years ago in Milan, and

        <font size="2">Your presence here today 
        indicates a great power for good. You come from many different nations

        industrial, professional, cultural and scientific fields. In the 
        solidarity of your association, you find mutual support, reciprocal 
        encouragement and a shared commitment to work for the common good. To 
        one who observes you with deep interest and keen attention it seems as 
        though you are offering, with sincerity and generosity, your talents, 
        your resources and your energies to the service of man. And to the 
        extent that you pursue this lofty ideal of reaching out to people 
        everywhere, I am certain that you will continue to find satisfaction and 
        human fulfillment. Indeed, in your very act of giving, of assisting, of 
        helping others to help themselves, you will find enrichment for your own 
        lives. In demonstrating ever greater involvement in the cause of man, 
        you will appreciate ever more the unsurpassed dignity and grandeur of 
        man, as well as his real fragility and vulnerability. And in your 
        efforts and endeavors for the good of man you can be assured of the 
        understanding and esteem of the Catholic Church. </font></p>

        will be surprised if, in my reflections, I add a word with special 
        reference to those Rotarians who are linked to me in the Christian 
        faith. Precisely at a moment when he was speaking about the progress of 
        man and the development of peoples, Paul VI proclaimed his conviction, 
        which is mine and that of Christians everywhere: &quot;By reason of his union 
        with Christ, the source of life, man attains to new fulfillment of 
        himself, to a transcendent humanism which gives him his greatest 
        possible perfection: this is the highest goal of personal development&quot;. 
        And it is to this &quot;new fulfillment&quot; and to this &quot;transcendent humanism&quot; 
        that I wish to give witness today, offering them as the complement of 
        all you are doing in your noble and worthy program of service. Thus 
        looking upon man as &quot;the primary and fundamental way for the Church&quot;, I 
        could not but likewise proclaim that &quot;Jesus Christ is the chief way for 
        the Church&quot;.&nbsp; </font></font></p>

        <font size="2">Finally, I would ask you 
        to convey to all the members of <b>Rotary International</b>, to all your 
        colleagues throughout the world, the expression of my esteem for the 
        efforts you are making on behalf of humanity. May your generous service 
        render honor to your respective countries and be reflected in the joy of 
        your daily lives. My special greeting goes to your children and to the 
        elderly at home, and my prayers include the many intentions that you 
        carry in your hearts. May God sustain Rotary International in the noble 
        cause of reaching out to serve humanity - humanity in need. </font>

        <font size="2">The Church is a willing 
        ally of all those who promote man's well-being, irrevocably committed as 
        she is to this cause, in virtue of her nature and her mandate. In my 
        Encyclical I emphasized the relationship between the Church's mission 
        and man, when I stated: &quot;Man in the full truth of his existence, of his 
        personal being and also of his community and social being - in the 
        sphere of his own family, in the sphere of society and very diverse 
        contexts, in the sphere of his own nation or people... and in the sphere 
        of the whole of mankind - this man is the primary route that the Church 
        must travel in fulfilling her mission: he is the primary and fundamental 
        way for the Church, the way traced out by Christ himself...&quot;. Because of 
        this solicitude of the Church for man in his concrete reality, permit me 
        to add a word of particular encouragement for your current program 
        encompassing your concern for &quot;<b>Health, Hunger, Humanity</b>&quot;. It is 
        meant to be your specific means of cooperating in the spiritual and 
        material progress of society, in defending human dignity, in applying 
        principles of upright conduct, and in exemplifying fraternal love. May 
        this program, so conceived, be a lasting contribution to man on the part 
        of Rotary International. </font></p>

        <font size="2">The three words 
        themselves open up extended areas and suggest so much to the ingenuity 
        of your spirit of service. As the modem world succeeds in producing more 
        and more quality medicine, vast numbers of people are still in dire need 
        of basic medical care. Despite magnificent efforts and achievements, the 
        area of preventive medicine remains to a great extent an unfulfilled 
        challenge. The dignity of man requires an attentive and truly 
        knowledgeable care for the sector of mental health - a whole area where 
        we again encounter human fragility and vulnerability, and where earnest 
        and sustained commitment to the grandeur and dignity of man is so 
        needed. </font></p>

        <font size="2">Widespread hunger 
        remains today one of the telling expressions of man's uncompleted quest 
        for progress and for the mastery of creation. Millions of children are 
        crying out to the world, pleading for food. And at the same time 
        millions of people are forced to bear in their bodies and their minds 
        the results of a lack of proper nourishment when they were young. They 
        exhibit before the witness of history the permanent scars of a 
        diminished or severely handicapped physical or mental condition. For all 
        who are willing to see, hunger is so real; at the same time hunger has 
        so many facets. Man is hungry for food, and yet he realizes that he does 
        not live &quot;by bread alone&quot;. Man is also hungry for knowledge of the 
        Creator, the Giver of all good gifts; he hungers for love and truth. The 
        human being hungers to be understood; he craves freedom and justice, and 
        true and lasting peace. </font></p>

        yourselves for your fellowman? And whatever other challenge remains in 
        the quest for human advancement - whether in the area of development or 
        liberation - can be grouped under your third category: humanity - the 
        betterment of humanity. To work for humanity, to serve men and women

        <font size="2">Dear Brothers and Sisters!</font></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText">
        <font size="2">First, I am pleased to receive all of you who have come to celebrate 
        your Jubilee at the beginning of this Lenten season. I first extend a 
        cordial greeting to you, the members of Rotary International. You have 
        crossed the threshold of the Holy Door in the Vatican Basilica and have 
        taken part in the Jubilee Eucharist at which Cardinal Paul Poupard 
        presided; he is here with us and I greet him with affection. Welcome, 
        dear brothers and sisters! I offer each of you my embrace of peace.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText">
        <font size="2">The celebration of the Jubilee is an excellent occasion for you to 
        meditate on the importance and value of being Christians at the dawn of 
        the third millennium. It would certainly be interesting to ask 
        yourselves what <b>Paul Percy Harris</b>, your founder, would do today 
        and how he would organize the association he founded almost 100 years 
        ago. At the dawn of the 20th century he became aware of the loneliness 
        experienced by people in large cities and sought to remedy it by 
        developing an ever-wider network of friendly relations between 
        individuals on the basis of understanding, sympathy and peace among 
        peoples.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText">
        <font size="2">You have tried to continue this service, dear <b>Rotarians</b>, in an 
        ever more concerned and attentive way in the almost 100 years of your 
        club's existence. The time we are living in is full of potential and 
        challenge. As we cross the threshold of the third millennium of the 
        Christian era, the Church once again presents the ancient and ever new 
        Gospel message to everyone. You Rotarians, who want to be generous 
        heralds and fearless witnesses of Christ, should also dedicate 
        yourselves to giving hope to people today, to overcoming loneliness, 
        indifference, selfishness and evil.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText">
        <font size="2">Second, I now greet you, dear faithful who are taking part in the 
        pilgrimage of the Diocese of Pitigliano-Sovana-Orbetello, and especially 
        your Pastor, Bishop Mario Meini, who has led you on this faith journey. 
        Through him, I would like to offer my encouragement and blessing to the 
        priests, religious and faithful of the Diocese.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</font><p class="MsoPlainText">
        </font></font></font></font></font>You come from the native land of my predecessor, Pope St Gregory VII. 
        May his example and teachings spur you to love Christ and his Church 
        with renewed intensity. He lived in a historical period when Christians 
        were shaken by serious internal difficulties and the pernicious 
        influence of the worldly spirit. Faced with the mentality of the time, 
        he strove to the very end, even during his sad exile, so that the &quot;Holy 
        Church, Bride of God, our lady and our mother, would once again be 
        adorned with her original splendor as she was for many centuries, and 
        always be free, chaste and catholic&quot; (PL 148, 709). He preached and bore 
        witness that holiness is the vocation of every member of the ecclesial 
        community.</font></td>
        <td width="50%" valign="top">

        </p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText">
        <font size="2">Times have undoubtedly changed. However, the invitation to all believers 
        to fulfill God's will eagerly and to be steadfast in bearing consistent 
        witness to the faith is still timely.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText">
        <font size="2">Dear brothers and sisters, the Holy Year not only offers us a special 
        grace, but also powerful reasons for converting mentalities and lives to 
        a deeper fidelity to Christ and a more intense love for the Church. 
        Returning home, continue in your commitment to Christian witness. Think 
        of yourselves as active members in building the Christian community:&nbsp; 
        &quot;Always be prepared to make a defense to anyone who calls you to account 
        for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness and reverence&quot; (1 
        Pt 3:&nbsp;15). Always have trust:&nbsp; Christ has overcome the world (cf. Jn 
        16:&nbsp;33)!&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText">
        <font size="2">Next I extend a cordial greeting to the director and members of the 
        Archdiocesan College of Pius XI in Desio. Dear friends, you have wished 
        to make your Jubilee pilgrimage at the beginning of the important season 
        of Lent, in which Christ's call to conversion becomes more insistent.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText">
        <font size="2">May the Jubilee pilgrimage be a favorable occasion for you to live 
        deeply this year of great spiritual riches. The Holy Door, through which 
        you have passed, signifies God's unlimited kindness to those who want to 
        turn to him and follow the path of holiness. Through this Door and 
        through the Church's ministry, believers are prompted to draw more 
        abundantly from the inexhaustible treasures of divine grace.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText">
        <font size="2">This is the gift and message for you too:&nbsp; may Christ, the Way, the 
        Truth and the Life renew you so that you will be his friends and 
        witnesses in the world. Be faithful to him and spread hope, joy and love 
        among your brothers and sisters.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText">
        <font size="2">Fourth, may these same sentiments also be in your hearts, dear faithful 
        from the parishes of Rieti, Bologna and Urbania. I greet you all 
        affectionately and, in addressing you, I would also like you to take the 
        Pope's best wishes back to your families, friends and brethren in faith. 
        In returning to your homes, may you be able to communicate to everyone 
        you meet the enthusiasm of a renewed faith and the commitment to active 
        charity. May Mary, Mother of the One who began the new time of salvation 
        and whom we call upon with trust, accompany you and always keep you 
        under the mantle of her protection.</font></font></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText">
        <font size="2">With these sentiments, I cordially impart a special Blessing to you, 
        which I willingly extend to your families and your communities.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font><style="font-size: 9pt" face="Arial"><p>
