		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">The Rotary gearwheel is one of the 
		most familiar symbols in the world today. But for many years, there was 
		no standard Rotary emblem. Rotary clubs designed their own.<br><br>In 
		its early years, the Rotary Club of Chicago used a wagon wheel emblem, 
		an idea attributed to Paul Harris, who reasoned that it symbolized 
		civilization and movement. The appearance changed from time to time.<br>
		<br>When an engraver joined the club, he offered to design a permanent 
		emblem. Members rejected his first idea---a plain buggy wheel---as 
		looking lifeless and meaningless. To give the appearance of action, the 
		engraver added clouds of dust ahead of and behind the wheel. He also 
		placed the words &quot;Rotary Club&quot; above it. One observant Rotarian pointed 
		out that a wheel would not generate clouds of dust in front of it. He 
		removed the offending cloud and that design remained the emblem for 
		Chicago until about 1912.<br><br>At the 1911 national convention in 
		Portland it was suggested that delegates adopt a standard emblem, based 
		upon the wheel, which had become the generally accepted emblem of Rotary 
		clubs. The Board of Directors appointed a committee to come up with a 
		design. Everyone was amazed how quickly the committee acted. They were 
		appointed in August and had the emblem ready in September. All they did 
		was copy the emblem used by the Rotary Club of Philadelphia.<br><br>The 
		Philadelphia club had been chartered in 1910 as the 19th club in the 
		world. [Bay City was the 134th club in 1915] The Philadelphians thought 
		that the Chicago wagon wheel design did not convey the Rotary idea very 
		well. They added cogs to create a working wheel, symbolizing the members 
		working together, literally interlocked with one another to achieve the 
		organization's objectives. They used 19 cogs in honor of their club. The 
		club started producing metal lapel pins in 1910 with this design for its 
		members to wear on their coats. Today, the millions of pins worn by 
		Rotarians around the world had their genesis in the minds of a club 
		president and a jeweler in Philadelphia in 1910.<br><br>The 1912 Rotary 
		convention in Duluth approved the Philadelphia design for the whole 
		organization. To ensure uniformity, the club's name was replaced by the 
		association's name, Rotary International. It probably didn't hurt that 
		the president of the Philadelphia club [who had designed that club's 
		emblem] became president of the International Association of Rotary 
		Clubs at the Duluth convention. <br><br>Even after approval by the 
		convention there was still a divergence in design of the emblem. Many 
		local clubs still had their own wheel. Some wheels had 8 spokes, other 
		had 10, some none at all. Some wheels had 16 gear cogs, some 20, some 
		none. Even the Rotary staff at headquarters was confused. In April 1919, 
		the Rotary wheel on the cover of The Rotarian magazine had 19 cogs. On 
		the May issue's cover the wheel had 20 cogs. On the June cover it had 27 
		cogs. <br><br>In 1918, a Rotarian engineer from Minnesota petitioned 
		Rotary to amend the design of the wheel. He said that a cogwheel with 19 
		cogs would not work. He said that the emblem had square-cornered teeth 
		of disproportionate size, that the cogs were irregularly spaced. This 
		Rotarian, Oscar Bjorge, said the emblem was &quot;an insult to engineering 
		that only the brain of an artist could conceive.&quot; So he sketched a new 
		wheel, with 6 spokes [symbolizing the 6 Objects of Rotary at that time] 
		and 24 cogs or teeth. He also added a keyway, which locks a wheel to a 
		hub, thus making it &quot;a worker and not an idler.&quot;<br><br>In 1928, the 
		exact specifications of this engineer were written into the Manual of 
		Procedure, approved at the 1929 Dallas convention. The specifications 
		have been unchanged ever since. The geared Rotary wheel appears today 
		throughout the world on millions of lapel pins, flags, ties, jewelry of 
		all sorts, etc. It has been pasted on billboards and postage stamps in 
		more than 100 countries. The Rotary wheel started as an idea in the mind 
		of founder Paul Harris nearly 100 years ago. It remained in its present 
		exact form for 75 years, until 25 August 2013.</td>
