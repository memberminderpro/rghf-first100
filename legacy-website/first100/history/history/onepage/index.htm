<h3>In 1905..... 37 year old attorney <a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/presidents/1910harris/">
Paul Harris</a> changed the world.
</h3>

	<img alt="Paul Harris, founder of Rotary" height="238" src="../../../images/Paul_Harris.jpg" class="pictureleft" width="207" /><p>
<strong>From the years 1891-1896 Paul Harris</strong>, who was raised by his New 
England grandparents with values of tolerance toward all, gained his law degree 
in 1891. <sup>1</sup> In his senior year, a former graduate told his class that 
they should &quot;Go to a small town for five years make a fool of themselves, then 
go to the big city!&quot; Paul decided to 
<a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/presidents/1910harris/paulharris/restless/">
hit the road</a>  for the entire world. He worked as a reporter for the San 
Francisco Chronicle, 1891; manual laborer on a fruit ranch, then raisin packing 
plant, teacher at the L.A. Business College in 1892. Denver, Colorado, 1892: 
Actor in a stock company, reporter for the Rocky Mountain News, cowboy, reporter 
for The Republican. Jacksonville, Florida: St. James Hotel night clerk, 
traveling granite/marble salesman 1892/93, reporter on the Washington Star, 
cattleman on a ship 1893, haymaker and cannery worker 1893, sub-foreman of the 
gang of cattlemen 1893, (where he wrote that, on his first voyage, he 
experienced sub-human conditions); orange picker in Florida 1893, back to 
Jacksonville selling marble granite. His territory included the southern states, 
Cuba, the Bahamas and Europe. When he announced that he was going to Chicago to 
practice law his employer said, &quot;Whatever the advantages of settling in Chicago 
may be, I am satisfied you will make more money if you remain with me.&quot; To which 
Paul replied: &quot;I am sure you are right but I am not going to Chicago for the 
purpose of making money; I am going for the purpose of living a life.&quot;
</p>		
<p><strong>
1896-1905</strong>  In 1896, he did go to Chicago to practice law. One evening, 
in 1900, Paul went with a professional friend to his suburban home. After 
dinner, as they strolled through the neighborhood, Paulâ€™s friend introduced 
him to tradesmen in their stores. This reminded Paul of his grandparentâ€™s home 
in New England. &quot;Why not have a fellowship composed of businessmen from 
different occupations, without restrictions of politics or religion?&quot; he 
thought. 
</p>
<p>
<strong> 1905-1908</strong><sup>2</sup> On February 23, 1905, Paul Harris had 
dinner with his closest friend, Chicago coal dealer <a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/leaders/schiele/index.htm">
Silvester Schiele</a>. Afterwards they walked over the river to <a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/711/">
Room 711</a> of the Unity Building where they met their host, Gustavus Loehr, a 
mining engineer; and another friend, Hiram Shorey, a merchant tailor. Harris 
proposed that they form a club. No name was chosen for the group. The second 
meeting was March 9th. Three other men, Harry Ruggles, William Jenson, and A. L. 
White joined them. Ruggles was a printer, and created the &quot;name badge&quot; version 
of the Rotary &quot;wheel&quot; and also started singing in Rotary. In fact his singing 
kept the group from disbanding more than once. Paul Harris later wrote: &quot;The 
significant occurrence of the second meeting was the introduction of 
 <a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/leaders/ruggles/index.htm">Harry Ruggles</a>, 
the printer. Harry was destined to play an important part in the life of the 
Chicago club, for through his suggestion of club singing his influence has been 
made felt by the entire movement.&quot; Paul P. Harris, page 95 &quot;The Founder of 
Rotary 1928. Two weeks later the group gathered at the office of Silvester 
Schiele, in his coal yard at Twelfth and State Streets. Six of the previous 
seven were present along with Charles Newton and Arthur B. Irwin.
</p> 
<p>
 <strong>1908-1910</strong><sup>1</sup> Paul was very interested in starting 
	Rotary in other cities. The second Rotary club was founded by   
 <a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/leaders/wood/">Homer Wood</a> in   
<a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/clubs/cities/clubs/02sanfrancisco.htm">
	San Francisco</a>  in 1908.<sup>7</sup> 
	Wood then quickly organized  <a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/clubs/cities/clubs/03oakland.htm"> 
	Oakland #3</a>. (When did weekly meetings begin? <sup>6</sup> 
	According to the <a href="http://www.whatpaulharriswrote.org/library/myroad/1905-1948/">
	general secretary in 1948</a>  , it was Oakland #3 in 1909.)  
<a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/clubs/cities/clubs/04seattle.htm">Seattle 
	#4 </a>  and   
<a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/clubs/cities/clubs/05losangeles.htm">Los 
	Angeles #5</a>. In fact, before the end of 1909, there were seven clubs, 
	including New York City #6 and Boston #7. That's right, in 1908 and 1909, 
	Homer Wood started four clubs. In the rest of the United States there were 
	two, and the San Francisco club is credited,  
<a href="http://www.whatpaulharriswrote.org/library/rotarianage/rotarianage.htm#help_for_newyork">
	by some</a>, with starting <a href="http://www.whatpaulharriswrote.org/library/rotarianage/rotarianage.htm#tweed_andny">
	New York</a>.
</p>
<h3>GROWTH OF ROTARY AROUND THE WORLD</h3>
<p>
 Paul Harris had a vision of &quot;Around the World Rotary&quot; which was also opposed by 
	many of his fellow Rotarians. It was not until he won the loyalty of the man 
	who was to be Rotaryâ€™s secretary from 1910 â€“ 1942 that Rotary became 
	organized and international. That man was   
<a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/secretariat/perry/">Chesley Perry</a>, 
	whom Paul called the &quot;Builder of Rotary.&quot;
 </p>
 
 <h3>ROTARY ORGANIZES</h3>
 <p>
 <strong>1910-1911 </strong><sup>3 &amp; 7</sup>  
  By August 1910 there were <em>sixteen clubs</em> and the <em>National 
	Association of Rotary Clubs</em> was organized and held its  <a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/presidents/conventions/1910/">
	first convention that year</a>, in Chicago. At the 1911 Portland Convention, <strong><em>
	&quot;Service, Not Self&quot;
 </em></strong>was introduced by  <a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/leaders/collins/"> 
	Frank Collins</a>
    of Minneapolis. It later became
    <strong><em>&quot;Service Above Self.&quot;</em></strong> The slogan <strong><em>&quot;He 
	profits most who serves best,&quot;</em></strong> 
    was also read there. It had been written by
 <a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/leaders/sheldon/">Arthur Sheldon</a> and 
	delivered by him at the first convention the previous year in Chicago. Both 
	were approved by RI in 1950. Learn what Sheldon really meant by his well 
	thought phrase. You can study all of Rotary's conventions from 1910 on and 
	learn about each of our presidents from Paul Harris to the present as well 
	as their clubs from 
 <a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/presidents/">our website dedicated to 
	presidents of Rotary.</a>  Another important event at the 1911 Portland 
	convention was the   
 <a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/leaders/sheldon/platform.htm">platform</a> 
	brought forward by 
          <a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/clubs/cities/clubs/04seattle/platform.htm">
	Seattle #4</a>. This platform, is still essential to the    
 <a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/leaders/sheldon/platform-today.htm">
	philosophy of Rotary today</a>.

<p><b>1912-23</b> <sup>4 </sup>When clubs were formed in Canada and Great 
Britain in 1912, the name was changed to the International Association of Rotary 
Clubs, and was later shortened to Rotary International in 1922.&nbsp; <sup>5 </sup>
Paul Harris was the first 
<a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/presidents/1910harris" target="_top">
president of the National Association of Rotary Clubs</a>, serving two terms. He 
was named President Emeritus of the International Association in 1912 and served 
until his death in 1947.
<sup>1 </sup>Harris suffered a near
<a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/presidents/1910harris/paulharris/health" target="_top">
fatal heart attack</a> in his final year as president of the National 
Association and required a full year to recover. Yet, over the next 35 years, he 
and his wife
<a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/women/jeanharris" target="_top"><b>
Jean Thomson Harris</b></a> made numerous exhausting trips to nearly every 
continent, visiting hundreds of cities, planting
<a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/library/trees" target="_top"><b>
friendship trees</b></a> and attending Rotary conferences.</p>
<p>
<b>1947</b><sup>5
</sup> As Rotary spanned the globe, branch offices were opened in Europe, South 
America, South Asia, Southwest Pacific. In the UK <b>
<a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/clubs/ireland-uk" target="_top">
British Rotary</a> </b>had its own office. <sup>6 </sup>When Rotary 
International President Emeritus, world traveler, author and prominent Chicago 
attorney <b>
<a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/presidents/1910harris/paulharris/memorial/" target="_top">
Paul Harris passed away on January 27, 1947</a></b>, his dream had grown from 
one group of four to 6,000 clubs in 75 countries with 300,000 members brought 
together through the service and fellowship of Rotary<br />
</p><p>
<b>1947-89</b><sup>4 </sup>Two world wars changed the face of Rotary â€“ parts 
of the Far East and Eastern Europe were closed to Rotary. Eventually, clubs were 
re-established in Japan, Germany, Poland and Hungary.&nbsp; In 1990 the first 
club was opened in the former Soviet Union and <b>
<a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/global/asia" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_top">
China</a></b>.&nbsp; In 1987, <b>
<a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/women" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_top">
Rotary membership was opened to women,</a> </b>and in 1989 the RI Council on 
Legislation standardized all Rotary documents and rules. 
</p><p>
<b>1989-2005</b> Rotary came close to removing polio from the face of the earth 
and, in 2005, returned, again, to Chicago to celebrate the first 100 years.
</p>
	<h3>How did Rotary get its name?&nbsp;</h3> 
	<p>
Harris explains from &quot;<a href="http://www.whatpaulharriswrote.org/library/founder/index.htm">The 
Founder of Rotary</a>&quot; page 96: &quot;During the course of one of the early meetings, 
Paul suggested several possible names for the new club. Among othersâ€”Rotary. 
It met with general favor and was adopted forthwith. The significance of the 
name becomes apparent on examination of the original plan of the club, which 
provided for rotation in the place of meeting, in the chairmanship, and even in 
membership which was to be continued for one year only.&quot;&nbsp;(<b><a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/history/headings/tenets.htm">For

<h3>
Who was the first Rotary president?</h3>
<p>
Silvester Schiele.&nbsp;The meeting, where a president was chosen, happened to be in 
Schiele's office, hence, as a courtesy, he became the president.&quot;<b><a href="http://www.whatpaulharriswrote.org/library/rotarianage/rotarianage.htm#While%20lacking%20qualities" style="text-decoration: none;">Silvester 
Schiele</a></b>, my most intimate Chicago friend, and one of the three who first 
met with me, was made our first president, and has been a constant member. 
Gustavus Loehr and Hiram Shorey were the other two but they failed to follow 
through. On the other hand Harry Ruggles, Charley Newton, and others who were 
quickly added to the group, with hearty zest joined in developing the project.&quot;&nbsp;
