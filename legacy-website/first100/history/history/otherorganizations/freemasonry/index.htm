		<img class="auto-style26" src="RotWheelCircle.jpg" style="float: left">These 
		badges were found by our historian colleague, Dr. Wolfgang Ziegler and 
		triggered off a search for its origin which has not yet been resolved. 
		The central part of what is otherwise a normal Rotary lapel badge, seems 
		to show the symbols of Freemasonry, the set square and compasses, while 
		the letter 'G' in the centre is also an indication of the Scottish Rite 
		of Masonry. We know that many of the early Rotarians were Masons and 
		that, according to C.R. Hewitt in 'Towards My Neighbour', some Rotary 
		clubs recruited exclusively from Freemasons until the practice was 
		banned in the 1920s. To date, no precise details of these links have 
		been found in the archives of either body.<br><br>The relationship was a 
		matter of some discussion and in February 1923, an article in 'The 
		Rotary Wheel' sought to allay fears among Rotarians who might think that 
		their membership of the one could cause problems in the other.<br><br>
		However, many people who did not know much about these organisations, 
		thought that Rotary was a form of Masonry. This eventually led to a much 
		more serious problem when the Catholic Church, which had long been an 
		antagonist of Masonry, classed Rotary as a similar organisation. <br>
		<br>
		Also 
		see the Ziegler Collection<br><br>G.K. Chesterton who was often a vocal 
		critic of Rotary, was a Catholic convert. and his adherence to the 
		sectarian line may have coloured his views.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="rotarymasonicnew.jpg" style="float: left">The problems seem to 
		have started in Spain about 1928 when the Bishops of Almeria, Leon, 
		Orense, Palencia and Tuy laid charges that Rotary is &quot;nothing else but a 
		new satanic organisation with the same background and teachings of 
		masonry&quot; and that &quot;according to documents and reliable sources, Rotary 
		is a suspected organisation, and should be considered as execrable and 
		perverse&quot;. The Church also criticised and condemned Rotary for showing a 
		concept of life and of service without reference to church teaching. 
		Indeed, it seems that they believed it a secret society with 
		quasi-religious overtones as many in the Church thought was the case 
		with Freemasonry. For whatever reason, the Vatican took up the reins and 
		in 1929 issued a decree that &quot;it is not expedient&quot; for Catholic priests 
		to participate in Rotary either as members or guests. This decree and 
		its implications were worrying to the many Catholics in Rotary not the 
		least the then President Tom Sutton who was himself a Catholic, and 
		former Chancellor Germany Wilhelm Cuno, a member in Hamburg.<br><br>Critical 
		and at times disparaging articles regularly appeared in Catholic 
		newspapers, especially in the 'Civilta Cattolica' in Italy, and Tom 
		Sutton went off to Rome to try to convince the Papal authorities that 
		Rotary was not Masonic, and that it was a movement which was not in 
		conflict with any Catholic teaching.<br><br>Sutton's attempts to 
		convince the Secretary of State in the Vatican, Cardinal Gaspari, were 
		fruitless and the anti-Rotary articles continued to be published. An 
		even more virulent article later appeared in Paris in 'La France 
		Catholique' making allegations about both Paul Harris and the links 
		between Rotary and Freemasonry, which were later reprinted in the Baltic 
		paper 'Rytas'.<br><br>The factual errors could be, and promptly were 
		shown to be false, and by 1933 there was a mood swing in the Vatican, 
		perhaps partly occasioned by the number of prominent and influential 
		Catholics throughout the world who were joining Rotary. Priests were now 
		allowed to use their discretion about attending or even joining Rotary. 
		Nevertheless, one of the results of the Church's attitude was the slow 
		development of Rotary in some predominantly Catholic countries such as 
		Ireland. <br><br>This uneasy peace continued until 1951 when another 
		Vatican decree warned priests that they should not join Rotary and that 
		&quot;the faithful should be aware of seditious and suspected organisations&quot;.
		<br><br>By then, however, the world had changed and the decree caused an 
		immediate angry response, among others from the then Catholic President 
		of RI, Arthur Laqueux, and from the Rotarian Catholic Bishop of Fort 
		Wayne, Indiana, who publicly declared the decree &quot;quite 
		incomprehensible&quot;.<br><br>Fairly soon, the Vatican began to retract. The 
		official newspaper 'Osservatore Romano' wrote &quot;In some nations, because 
		of a prevalent Masonic influx, the action of Rotary Clubs has conflicted 
		with the activity and the needs of the Church. It must be said, however, 
		that such has not been the case in other nations where the attitude of 
		Rotary has shown itself in practice tolerant and benevolent towards 
		religious interests.&quot;<br><br>By the end of the decade, the Catholic Truth 
		Society was able to declare that &quot;Rotary is neither secret nor 
		seditious&quot;. It was nevertheless still regarded as a &quot;society banned 
		under pain of sin only&quot; and not of &quot;sin and excommunication&quot;. Gradually 
		there was a thaw in relations between the Church and Rotary. In 1970 
		Pope Pius VI addressed Rotarians in Italy, and in 1979 Pope John Paul II 
		spoke to the International Convention in Rome, praising some of Rotary's 
		humanitarian programmes at a special audience in the Vatican. Later he 
		accepted a Paul Harris Fellowship and a World Understanding and Peace 
		Award from Rotary, while Catholic priests throughout the world were 
		taking positions of authority, even serving as District Governors. <br>
		<br>As Alvarez points out, it was not only Rotary that was condemned 
		during the 1930s and 1940s. The Lions Clubs and even the YMCA incurred 
		the wrath of the Vatican. In fact, the condemnation of the Y.M.C.A. was 
		even earlier in 1920 when it was described as &quot;White Masonry&quot;, on the 
		grounds that &quot;such organisation, while showing special concern for the 
		youth, corrupted their faith, teaching them a conception of life 
		dispensing with the Church and all religious teachings. The Y.M.C.A. is 
		contributing to the decay of the youth's faith, by affirming that its 
		purpose is to show them a conception of life without churches or 
		religious confession&quot;.<br><br>Based on Nicholl's 'The 
		Golden Wheel', Juan Alvarez's excellent analysis of 'Masonry in Latin 
		America', RIBI's 'The Rotary Wheel' and other published works.<br>Also see, Rotarian Lodge #4195<br><br>

		to the piece about Masons and Rotary</strong><br><br>Prince Conti, 
		District Governor of D46 (Italy) in 1928 wrote: &quot;Lately a few Catholic 
		papers have shown doubts as to the origin and the work of our 
		Association; and worse than that, they have tried to trace relations 
		between Rotary and Masonry. These doubts of the Catholic press are not 
		in the least just, and many Catholic priests belong to Rotary. We are 
		sorry that such doubts exist, but we are not troubled, because we know 
		perfectly well that no tie exists between the two Associations, and that 
		in all our manifestations there is not one single thing that is not 
		compatible with our consciences as Catholics and Italians and Fascists.<br>
		<br>As the General President, Harry Rogers declared at the International 
		Convention at Ostend, no tie has ever existed, exists, or will ever 
		exist between the two associations. As President of Italian Rotary I 
		declare that I would not remain in this position one hour if I had any 
		doubts on this subject.<br><br>In this extract from an article in 
		'Rotary Wheel' in December 1928, Prince Conti hints at the problems 
		Rotary was encountering in Italy as it was in Spain and Ireland. <br>
		<br>Pietro 
		Brunoldi (with help from Wolfgang Ziegler) writes on 22 July 2008:<br>
		<br>Prince Piero Ginori Conti was NOT a President of the Rotary in 
		Italy, but simply District Governor in 1928-29 (District 46), 
		representing the district newborn in the year 1925. So, probably there 
		was a misunderstanding (or bad translation) when he wrote District 
		Governor..... probably by someone who didn't know the meaning of DG and 
		interpreted it as President.</td>
