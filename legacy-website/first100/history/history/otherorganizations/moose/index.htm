												It was just the two remaining

												Moose from disappearing 
												altogether, until the fall of 
												1906, when an outgoing young 
												government clerk from Elwood, 
												Ind., was invited to enroll into 
												the Crawfordsville Lodge. It was 
												on James J. Davis' 33rd 
												birthday, October 27, that he 
												became just the 247th member of 
												the Loyal Order of Moose. </p>
												<p class="BodyNormal" align="justify">
												Davis, a native of Wales who had 
												worked from boyhood as an &quot;iron 
												puddler&quot; in the steel mills of 
												Pennsylvania, had also been a 
												labor organizer and immediately 
												saw potential to build the tiny 
												Moose fraternity into a force to 
												provide protection and security 
												for a largely working-class 
												membership. At the time little 
												or no government &quot;safety net&quot; 
												existed to provide benefits to 
												the wife and children of a 
												breadwinner who died or became 
												disabled. Davis proposed to 
												&quot;pitch&quot; Moose membership as a 
												way to provide such protection 
												at a bargain price; annual dues 
												of $5 to $10. Given a green 
												light and the title of &quot;Supreme 
												Organizer,&quot; Davis and a few 
												other colleagues set out to 
												solicit members and organize 
												Moose Lodges across the U.S. and 
												southern Canada. (In 1926, the 
												Moose fraternity's presence 
												extended across the Atlantic, 
												with the founding of the Grand 
												Lodge of Great Britain.) </p>

												<strong>The Birth of Mooseheart
												</strong></p>
												<p class="BodyNormal" align="justify">
												After careful consideration of 
												numerous sites, the Moose 
												Supreme Council in late 1912 
												approved the purchase of what 
												was known as the Brookline 
												Farm--more than 1,000 acres 
												along the then-dirt surfaced 
												Lincoln Highway, between Batavia 
												and North Aurora on the west 
												side of the Fox River, about 40 
												miles west of Chicago. Ohio 
												Congressman John Lentz, a member 
												of the Supreme Council, 
												conceived the name &quot;Mooseheart&quot; 
												for the new community: &quot;This,&quot; 
												he said, &quot;will always be the 
												place where the Moose fraternity 
												will collectively pour out its 
												heart, its devotion and 
												sustenance, to the children of 
												its members in need.&quot; </p>
												<p class="normal" align="justify">
												<span class="BodyNormal">So it 
												was on a hot summer Sunday, July 
												27, 1913, that several thousand 
												Moose men and women (for the 
												Women of the Moose received 
												formal recognition that year as 
												the organization's official 
												female component) gathered under 
												a rented circus tent toward the 
												south end of the new property 
												and placed the cornerstone for 
												Mooseheart. The first 11 
												youngsters in residence were 
												present, having been admitted 
												earlier that month; they and a 
												handful of workers were housed 
												in the original farmhouse and a 
												few rough-hewn frame buildings 
												that had been erected that 
												spring</span>. </p>
												<p class="BodySubHeader2" align="justify">
												<strong>Addressing Need on the 
												Other End of Life: Moosehaven
												</strong></p>
												<p class="BodyNormal" align="justify">
												Mooseheart's construction 
												proceeded furiously over the 
												next decade, but it only barely 
												kept pace with the admissions 
												that swelled the student census 
												to nearly 1,000 by 1920. 
												(Mooseheart's student population 
												would reach a peak of 1,300 
												during the depths of the Great 
												Depression; housing was often 
												&quot;barracks&quot; style - unacceptable 
												by today's standards. Mooseheart 
												officials now consider the 
												campus' ultimate maximum 
												capacity as no more than 500.) 
												Still, by the Twenties, Davis 
												and his Moose colleagues thought 
												the fraternity should do 
												more--this time for aged members 
												who were having trouble making 
												ends meet in retirement. (A 
												limited number of elderly 
												members had been invited to live 
												at Mooseheart since 1915.) </p>
												<p class="BodyNormal" align="justify">
												They bought 26 acres of 
												shoreline property just south of 
												Jacksonville, Florida, and in 
												the fall of 1922, Moosehaven, 
												the &quot;City of Contentment,&quot; was 
												opened, with the arrival of its 
												first 22 retired Moose 
												residents. Moosehaven has since 
												grown to a 63-acre community 
												providing a comfortable home, a 
												wide array of recreational 
												activities and comprehensive 
												health care to more than 400 
												residents. </p>
												<p class="BodyNormal" align="justify">
												As the Moose fraternity grew in 
												visibility and influence, so did 
												Jim Davis. President Warren 
												Harding named him to his Cabinet 
												as Secretary of Labor in 1921, 
												and Davis continued in that post 
												under Presidents Calvin Coolidge 
												and Herbert Hoover as well. In 
												November 1930, Davis, a 
												Republican, won election to the 
												U.S. Senate from Pennsylvania, 
												and he served there with 
												distinction for the next 14 
												years. As both Labor Secretary 
												and Senator, Davis was known as 
												a conservative champion of 
												labor, who fought hard for the 
												rights of unions--but felt that 
												the workingman should expect no 
												&quot;handouts&quot; of any sort. In the 
												Senate, it was Davis who 
												spearheaded passage of landmark 
												legislation to force building 
												contractors to pay laborers 
												&quot;prevailing&quot; union-level wages 
												in any government construction 
												work. The law bore his name: the 
												Davis-Bacon Act. </p>

												When the 19th Amendment had 
												granted women the right to vote 
												in 1920, Smith, (from 
												Indianapolis,) reasoned 
												correctly, that women in 
												politics would be a &quot;growth 
												market.&quot; She quit her 
												secretarial job to go to work in 
												Warren Harding's successful 
												Presidential campaign--and, 
												still in her 20s, she was 
												rewarded with an appointment as 
												Director of Public Employment in 
												Washington. Labor Secretary 
												Davis was her boss, and he 
												immediately recognized her 
												talent and drive. It took him 
												five years to convince her to 
												quit her government job and go 
												to work for him running the 
												Women of the Moose. A 
												stereotypical &quot;women's program&quot; 
												held no interest for her, Smith 
												argued. &quot;So get out there and 
												make a program,&quot; Davis retorted. 
												She did exactly that, as the 
												organization's first Grand 
												Chancellor, for the next 38 
												years until her retirement in 
												1964, at which point the Women 
												of the Moose boasted 250,000 
												members. (It has since grown to

												Moose endeavor of the modern 
												era, the Civic Affairs program 
												(later renamed Community
