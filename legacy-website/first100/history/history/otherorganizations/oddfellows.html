						<h1><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">
						History of Odd Fellowship</font></h1>
						</center><center><b><font size="2">WHY THE NAME ODD 
						FELLOWS? </font></b></center>
						<p><font size="2">There are several different reasons 
						given for our strange name. One old and apparently 
						authoritative history of Odd Fellowship gives the 
						explanation, &quot;That common laboring men should associate 
						themselves together and form a fraternity for social 
						unity and fellowship and for mutual help was such a 
						marked violation of the trends of the times (England in 
						the 1700's) that they became known as 'peculiar' or 
						'odd,' and hence they were derided as 'Odd Fellows.' 
						Because of the appropriateness of the name, those 
						engaged in forming these unions accepted it. When 
						legally incorporated the title 'Odd Fellows' was 
						adopted.&quot;</font></p>
						<p><font size="2">Another, similar explanation is that 
						the original Odd Fellows were men who were engaged in 
						various or odd trades, as there were organizations for 
						some of the larger trades.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2">Modern references state that the true 
						reason for the name Odd Fellows isn't known or 
						documented. Whatever the reason may have been, the 
						unusual name has been the object of public curiosity 
						(and on occasion derision or mirth) for well over 200 
						years.</font></p>
						<center><b><font size="2">THE BEGINNING OF ODD 
						FELLOWSHIP</font></b></center>
						<p><font size="2">Although some books claim to trace Odd 
						Fellowship back to Roman times when members of the Roman 
						Legions in England were called &quot;Fellow Citizens&quot;, what 
						is said to be the earliest printed record of an Odd 
						Fellows Lodge appears in a reference to a lodge meeting 
						at a Globe Tavern in England, in 1748. This lodge was 
						numbered nine, so apparently there were at least nine 
						associated Odd Fellows lodges at that time.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2">Other evidence suggests that our 
						origins were in an organization known as the Ancient 
						Order of Bucks which thrived in England in the 18th 
						Century, and had as its emblem three bucks with their 
						antlers intertwined. These men had as their leader a 
						&quot;Most Noble Grand&quot; and met in club rooms and taverns. 
						One of their principal emblems was &quot;a bundle of sticks,&quot; 
						familiar to modern Odd Fellows as signifying strength in 
						union. They dropped &quot;Bucks&quot; from the name in 1802. 
						Whatever the origin, solid evidence begins to be found 
						in the late 18th Century. By 1796 Odd Fellow 
						organizations were numerous in England, and each was 
						independent from the others. Fraternal groups such as 
						the Odd Fellows were suppressed in England for a time, 
						but by 1803 the Odd Fellows were revived by an 
						organization called &quot;London Union Odd Fellows,&quot; which 
						later became known as the &quot;Grand Lodge of England&quot; and 
						assumed authority over all Odd Fellow lodges in that 
						country.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2">Victory Lodge in Manchester declared 
						itself independent of the Grand Lodge of England in 
						1809. In 1814, the six Odd Fellows lodges in the 
						Manchester area met and formed The Manchester Unity of 
						the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, which elected 
						officers and proceeded to standardize degree work of the 
						lodges.</font></p>
						<center><b><font size="2">ODD FELLOWSHIP IN NORTH 
						AMERICA</font></b></center>
						<p><font size="2">Among the first records of the Order 
						in America is that of five Brothers of the English Order 
						who met in New York City in 1806, and formed Shakespeare 
						Lodge No. 1.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2">The founders were three boat builders, 
						a comedian and a vocalist - a group befitting the name 
						&quot;Odd Fellows,&quot; indeed. The lodge was self instituted, a 
						common practice in those times.&nbsp; Their first candidate 
						was a retired actor who was the keeper of the tavern 
						where they met. Accounts state that lodge meetings were 
						accompanied by merry making and mirth, and that the 
						wares of the tavern were freely indulged in. This lodge 
						was dissolved in 1813 due to poor attendance brought on 
						by controversy over the War of 1812.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2">Another lodge of which little is known 
						existed briefly in New York in 1816. In 1818, 
						Shakespeare Lodge in New York was re-instituted, in the 
						Red Cow tavern, operated by a former member who had in 
						his keeping the books and papers of the former lodge. 
						They claimed to have received a charter from the 
						Manchester Unity which gave them authority over all 
						other Odd Fellows Lodges in the United States, but this 
						authority was not accepted by other lodges. Several more 
						lodges were founded in the New York City area, and one 
						in Philadelphia, due to the efforts of the Brothers of 
						Shakespeare Lodge.</font></p>
						<p><a name="ThomasWildey"><font size="2">The</font></a><font size="2"> 
						Independent Order of Odd Fellows as we know it today 
						began in Baltimore, Maryland, where five members of the 
						Order from England founded Washington Lodge No. 1 on 
						April 26,1819, by self-institution. One of these 
						Brothers was
						Thomas Wildey, the first Noble Grand and the man 
						revered as the founder of Odd Fellowship in North 
						America. A charter was received from Duke of York Lodge 
						in Preston, England, in 1820, a year and a half after 
						its self-institution.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2">A second lodge was formed in Baltimore 
						in 1819, but these two lodges and those in New York were 
						unaware of each others' existence for some time, 
						communications being slow in those days, and there being 
						no reason such information would travel from one city to 
						another except by pure chance.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2">In 1821, the &quot;Grand Lodge of Maryland 
						and of the United States of America, of the Independent 
						Order of Odd Fellows,&quot; was founded. Brother Wildey also 
						served as the first Grand Master/Grand Sire of the first 
						Grand Lodge, for a period of 12 years. Several more 
						lodges were established, and in 1824, the &quot;Grand Lodge 
						of the United States&quot; now termed &quot;The Sovereign Grand 
						Lodge,&quot; was separated from the Grand Lodge of Maryland. 
						The Independent Order of Odd Fellows in North America 
						(United States and Canada) became independent from the 
						Order in England in 1834.</font></p>
						<center><b><font size="2">ODD FELLOWSHIP EXPANDS WEST</font></b></center>
						<p><font size="2">There were several abortive attempts 
						to establish Odd Fellowship in the Western United 
						States, beginning in the late 1840's.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2">One of the first occurred when a 
						member, leading a party sailing from Gloucester, 
						Massachusetts, to what he called &quot;the City of Oregon, on 
						the Columbia River,&quot; obtained a charter through what 
						was, at best, irregular channels. He had written to both 
						the Grand Sire and the Grand Secretary of the Grand 
						Lodge of the United States, after which he alleged that 
						they had directed him to obtain necessary papers and 
						authority from a Deputy Grand Sire in Massachusetts. 
						Asked by the Deputy Grand Sire to see the letters, the 
						Brother in question stated they had been packed by 
						mistake, and were now on the ship, about to sail for 
						Oregon.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2">However, the ship and its party of Odd 
						Fellows reached not the &quot;City of Oregon,&quot; but the 
						Sandwich Islands, and established the first Odd Fellows 
						Lodge west of the Mississippi River, Excelsior Lodge No. 
						1, in Honolulu, Hawaii, with the charter signed by King 
						Kamehameha, the reigning monarch of the Sandwich Islands 
						which were later renamed the Hawaiian Islands.</font></p>
						<center><b><font size="2">ODD FELLOWSHIP IN CALIFORNIA</font></b></center>
						<p><font size="2">The good works of Odd Fellowship were 
						in evidence in California prior to the official 
						establishment of the fraternity here. The official 
						establishment of Odd Fellowship in California had its 
						birth in the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where a 
						short time prior to January 12, 1849, the Most Worthy 
						Grand Sire, Horn R. Kneass, issued a charter entitled 
						&quot;California Lodge No. l.&quot;</font></p>
						<p><font size="2">Due to the excitement of the discovery 
						of gold at Coloma, in January, 1848, the Port of Yerba 
						Buena (San Francisco) was in a turmoil throughout 1849. 
						Two of the three petitioners left for the gold fields in 
						the &quot;Mother Lode,&quot; to seek their fortunes. Everything 
						pertaining to Odd Fellowship was left with James Smiley. 
						He made one or two attempts, within the next three 
						months to organize an Odd Fellows lodge, but with so 
						many leaving for the gold fields, the idea was 
						abandoned.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2">When some of the brothers returned 
						from the gold fields, he was able to gather a sufficient 
						number of former brothers to assist in making up the 
						complement of charter members, required by the laws 
						under which they secured the charter. On September 9, 
						1849, one year to the day before California was admitted 
						to the Union as the 31st State, California Lodge No. 1 
						came into being, in the City of San Francisco, with 
						Brother Smiley instituting the lodge.</font></p>
						<p align="center"><font size="2">
						<img height="154" alt="San Francisco Odd Fellows Temple" src="oddfellows/SFTemple.GIF" width="151" align="bottom" border="2">
						</font></p>
						<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>SAN FRANCISCO ODD 
						FELLOWS TEMPLE: The Odd Fellows Temple, located on the 
						corner of Seventh and Market Streets in San Francisco, 
						was one of the showpieces in the city. The structure was 
						destroyed during the 1906 earthquake, the Odd Fellows 
						rebuilt on the same site with a comparable building. For 
						many years the Grand Lodge office was located in the San 
						Francisco Odd Fellows Temple.</b> </font></p>
						<p><font size="2">Several months previous to the 
						organization of California Lodge No. 1 the brothers of 
						San Francisco were at work relieving the suffering, and 
						during a few months they expended over $100,000. It was 
						not unusual during this period, and for a number of 
						years, to cost a member $5.00 or even $10.00 to attend a 
						meeting, for there was no regular means of collecting 
						dues, or paying benefits, and the calls for aid were 
						many.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2">An interesting feature of California 
						Lodge No. 1 during their formation period was their dues 
						structure. They adopted their first By Laws November 25, 
						1850, and the initiation fee was set at $50.00; dues, 
						$10.00 per quarter in advance; and no benefits were to 
						be paid a Brother who was able to pay his own expenses. 
						Two years later San Francisco Lodge No. 3 was 
						established.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2">In Sacramento an association was 
						organized by a Texas Odd Fellow, A. M. Winn, later the 
						founder of the Native Sons of the Golden West. The 
						brother published a notice in the &quot;Pacific News&quot; calling 
						all Odd Fellows together. More than 100 three linkers 
						assembled on August 20, 1849, to organize a relief 
						association. They had no authority to organize and adopt 
						the Odd Fellows name but the necessities of the times 
						demanded prompt action. Brother Winn was elected 
						President, and he was authorized to call upon any member 
						to nurse the sick free of charge, when nurses were 
						receiving $16.00 a day for such services. The Odd 
						Fellows were joined by the Masons in establishing the 
						first hospital in California, and within a few months 
						had expended some $30,000.00 in relieving distress. 
						Shortly thereafter Sacramento Lodge No. 2 was instituted 
						and the following year Eureka Lodge No. 4 was formed. 
						Odd Fellow relief associations were also organized in 
						Stockton and Marysville, soon followed by the 
						institution of Charity Lodge No. 6 in Stockton and Yuba 
						Lodge No. 5 in Marysville. In addition to San Francisco, 
						Sacramento, Stockton and Marysville, many Odd Fellow 
						lodges were soon established throughout the Mother Lode 
						area of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2">In time, Odd Fellowship spread 
						throughout the state. The list of lodges once included 
						almost every city, town or hamlet, in the &quot;Golden 
						State&quot;. At one time, lodges in the Oregon and Washington 
						Territory, along with those in British Columbia, were 
						under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of California.</font></p>
						<center><b><font size="2">INTERNATIONAL ODD FELLOWSHIP</font></b></center>
						<p><font size="2">The early day Odd Fellows in 
						California played an important part in the spreading of 
						Odd Fellowship to other countries when Templer Lodge No. 
						15 of San Francisco by unanimous vote appropriated 
						$1,200 to establish the Order in Germany in 1869. 
						Wuerttemberg Lodge No. 1 of Stuttgart was instituted the 
						following year by John A. Morse, a Past Grand Master of 
						California. From Germany the Order spread to many other 
						countries and territories throughout Europe. The Order 
						is presently located in Australia, Austria, Belgium, 
						Chile, Cuba, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, 
						Labrador, New Zealand, Norway, The Netherlands, Peru, 
						Puerto Rico, Sweden, Switzerland, Uruguay, and 
						Venezuela. Due to recent political changes in Eastern 
						Europe and the Balkan countries, Odd Fellowship has 
						already been re-established in Leipzig, Germany. The 
						ground work is being laid to establish lodges in other 
						parts of the former Eastern area of Germany, Estonia, 
						Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, and Hungary, under the 
						leadership of the Odd Fellows in Europe.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2">A series of short historical articles 
						in an 1988 issue of The Illinois Odd Fellow, from which 
						some of these notes were taken, mentions that in 1827 
						the fourth lodge in Maryland, William Tell Lodge No. 4, 
						was chartered to work in the German language. 
						Eventually, many jurisdictions had German-speaking 
						lodges, and German Rituals were provided. In California, 
						Harmony Lodge No. 13, Concordia Lodge No. 122, and 
						Hermann Lodge No. 145 were all established in San 
						Francisco in the 1850's and 1860's, originally working 
						in the German language as did lodges in other California 
						cities. Likewise lodges working in the Italian, Swedish, 
						and French languages were instituted, and today 
						Franco-American Lodge No. 207 is still a bilingual 
						French speaking lodge in California.<br>
