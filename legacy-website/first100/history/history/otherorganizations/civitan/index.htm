				17, 1917, was no ordinary day . . . nor were the people involved 
				ordinary men. They were business and professional leaders 
				concerned, not only about their community, but about world 
				events. They were dreamers, too, wanting to make a difference in 
				their world. They believed their actions could help build a 
				better world.<br>
				<br>
				They had been meeting as a civic club which was slanted just a 
				little too much toward personal gain to suit these men. They 
				gave up the charter they had purchased and set out to make a 
				club suitable to them. Gregory Johnston was elected as the first 
				president of the group. Eventually they settled on the name 
				Civitan, a phrase coined from the Latin &quot;civitas,&quot; loosely 
				meaning citizenship. 
				<p>It had been suggested by Jelks H. Cabaniss. &quot;Builders of Good 
				Citizenship&quot; was a 
				natural motto for the civic-minded group. Arthur C. Crowder was 
				the Civitan who 
				suggested this symbolic phrase. <br>
				<br>
				The club continued on a purely local basis during the frantic 
				World War I years 
				which began only a month and 11 days after the club formed. The 
				group 
				succeeded in every effort to benefit soldiers. It was a job of 
				untiring loyalty and 
				patriotism.<br>
				<br>
				Arthur C. Crowder was the club's second president. Returning 
				soldiers were 
				heartily welcomed back into the club, and service projects began 
				to focus on 
				children. Crowder was followed by Dr. Courtney W. Shropshire, 
				who served two 
				terms as president.<br>
				<br>
				The dream of an international organization began with Shropshire, 
				a surgeon 
				seldom seen without a red carnation in his lapel. He shared his 
				dream with a few 
				close friends in the Birmingham Club, and the proposal was given 
				unanimous 
				approval by a small but enthusiastic group present at the 
				Shropshire home that 
				day. In that group were Jelks Cabaniss, Arthur Crowder, Reid 
				Lawson, Percy W. 
				Brower, H. E. Shropshire (Courtney's father), C. E. Woodrow, 
				Kenneth C. Charlton, 
				and John V. Mix.<br>
				<br>
				The process to incorporate was begun, and on April 15, 1920, the 
				group met at the 
				Southern Club, and Civitan International was born. Officers 
				elected were: Dr. 
				Courtney W. Shropshire, president; Rev. J. A. MacSporran, vice 
				president; John 
				Fry, treasurer; and John Mix, secretary. Charter Number One went 
				to the 
				Birmingham Civitan Club, later designated as &quot;The Mother Club of 
				Civitan 
				International.&quot;<br>
				<br>
				In the following months clubs in Helena, Arkansas; Memphis and 
				Knoxville, 
				Tennessee; and Jacksonville, Florida, were chartered. By June of 
				1921, when the 
				first international convention was held in Birmingham, there 
				were 30 clubs and 
				more than 300 delegates at the convention.<br>
				<br>
				At the second convention in Chattanooga, Tennessee, delegates 
				from 115 clubs 
				attended. There were more than 3,300 Civitans throughout the 
				United States.<br>
				<br>
				Delegates to the 1925 convention bestowed the title, &quot;Founder of 
				Civitan 
				International,&quot; on Shropshire. He is the only person to serve 
				two terms as 
				president. By then Civitan had 180 clubs.<br>
				<br>
				Shropshire had many dreams for the organization, some he would 
				live to see, 
				others would be accomplished only after his death. Shropshire 
				viewed women as 
				partners, not only in life, but in civic involvement as well. 
				The late 1920s would see 
				a ladies auxiliary informally adopted by the organization, but 
				the dream of women 
				as full members would not be realized until much later.<br>
				<br>
				In 1974 at the Boston Convention, a proposal to delete the term 
				&quot;male&quot; from 
				membership requirements was hotly debated. In fact, it was first 
				thought the 
				motion had been defeated.<br>
				<br>
				A delegate, who was also a lawyer, pointed out that only the 
				Bylaws required 
				changing because membership requirements were in the Bylaws, not 
				the 
				Constitution. After a conference with the Judge Advocate and 
				other legal experts 
				in attendance, the point of order was upheld and the motion 
				passed. Soon Civitans 
				were building all-female clubs, a concept that changed as many 
				established clubs 
				decided to go co-ed.<br>
				<br>
				From the very beginning, Civitan encouraged its clubs to seek 
				out needs within 
				their community and to fulfill those needs. Some truly 
				outstanding projects were 
				among those tackled by these far-sighted leaders. They found 
				crippled children 
				living in dire poverty and paid for operations to help them 
				walk.<br>
				<br>
				They built hospitals, parks, playgrounds. They served as big 
				brothers to troubled 
				boys. They registered voters. Their dreams were big, their 
				sights high, their 
				accomplishments great.<br>
				<br>
				The dream of a truly international organization was fleeting. 
				Early clubs in 
				Switzerland and Canada failed, but leaders kept trying. It was 
				not until 1932 that the 
				Toronto Civitan Club was chartered.<br>
				<br>
				And, it would be nearly 40 years before Civitan would establish 
				clubs in Europe. In 
				1969 the Oslo, Norway, Club was chartered. By the mid-1970s, 
				clubs would be 
				chartered in other European countries and in Asia.<br>
				<br>
				From the time Civitan chartered its first clubs, aid to those 
				less fortunate was a 
				notable project. Concern for retarded children was a natural 
				expansion of the early 
				effort to assist crippled children. By the decade of the 1950s, 
				Civitan work in this 
				area had made giant strides and a momentous decision was made to 
				adopt the 
				mentally retarded as a major emphasis project.<br>
				<br>
				While on a business trip in 1951, Civitan Earl Carver stopped by 
				a small bakery in 
				Claxton, Georgia. He purchased a loaf of the bakery's fruit 
				cake. It was so good, he 
				purchased others to take home to Florida. He got the idea of his 
				club selling the 
				cake to raise money for projects. His club liked the idea and 
				the sample cakes.<br>
				<br>
				Civitan's most profitable fund raiser began and continues to be 
				the chief fund 
				raising project of many clubs. Civitan and Claxton Fruit Cake 
				have become 
				synonymous during the holiday season in Canada and the United 
				States.<br>
				<br>
				In 1960 the Civitan International Foundation was established by 
				the executive 
				board. It took the death of our Founder, Courtney W. Shropshire 
				in 1965, to 
				provide the impetus to get the foundation really going.<br>
				<br>
				That year a scholarship fund for needy college students was 
				established in his 
				memory. Programs to honor outstanding members were created to 
				collect funds. 
				Only interest from these funds would be used as scholarships.<br>
				<br>
				Other plans were made for the expansion of the Foundation, but 
				little else was 
				accomplished until 1976 when Louisville, Kentucky, Civitans 
				approached the 
				executive board about a project to place candy boxes in 
				restaurants. Patrons would 
				deposit loose change in return for a mint.<br>
				<br>
				The first funds completed construction of Cedar Lake Lodge, a 
				home for mentally 
				disabled adults near Louisville. Later projects would fund homes 
				and other projects on behalf of people with developmental 
				disabilities. Soon after this project was adopted, Civitan had 
				funds to expand it work for people with developmental 
				disabilities . . . all because of the dream of Louisville 
				Civitans.<br>
				<br>
				Today another dream is a reality. The Civitan International 
				Research Center was 
				dedicated in 1992 during the Birmingham Convention. Civitans are 
				once again 
				reaching out to those in need in new ways -- this time not only 
				to provide 
				treatment but to look for ways to improve the quality of life 
				and perhaps eventually 
				prevent mental disabilities and other developmental 
				disabilities.<br>
				<br>
				Project History<br>
				<br>
				Projects have always been a shining monument to the work and 
				concern of Civitan 
				clubs for their communities. Extraordinary projects were 
				accomplished by ordinary 
				citizens like you and me. The thought that a project cost too 
				much did not stop them 
				from working hard for the community. Here are a few projects 
				from the first 10 years:<br>
				<br>
				&quot;Umm-mm! Ain't this great!&quot; was the comment of hundreds of 
				youngsters returning 
				home from Washington, D. C.'s Civitan Fresh Air Camp. Children 
				spent two weeks at 
				the camp, 35 miles from the city, among cool, shady trees. Over 
				the summer nearly 800 
				youngsters enjoyed the camp experience, thanks to Washington 
				Civitans. (August 
				1922)<br>
				<br>
				Little Rock, Arkansas, establish a park for the city, complete 
				with benches, children's 
				playground, and landscaping. One of the club's fund raising 
				projects on behalf of the 
				park was the sale of fly swatters! (August 1922)<br>
				<br>
				Charlotte, North Carolina, institutes an essay contest for high 
				school and junior high 
				school students on the duties and privileges of citizenship. 
				(November 1922)<br>
				<br>
				Chattanooga, Tennessee, got into the movement to help crippled 
				children, earmarking 
				60 percent of the revenue from their next Civitan show for this 
				project. Club President 
				T. C. Thompson discovered an 11-year-old crippled girl living in 
				dire circumstances in 
				the mountains near the city. She cooked for a family of eight. 
				Against the opposition 
				of the stepmother, the girl was taken from the family, given new 
				clothing and medical 
				attention. (November 1922)<br>
				<br>
				In January 1922, after learning of the plight of tuberculosis 
				patients, Knoxville, 
				Tennessee, took on the responsibility of building a hospital for 
				the care of indigent 
				tuberculosis patients. The Tennessee Tuberculosis Association 
				had purchased a 
				128-acre farm and had $3,000 cash for the project. Civitans 
				committed themselves to 
				raising $100,000 and set out to raise the money. By June 6 they 
				had completed the 
				campaign and were working on plans for the new hospital. 
				Construction began and 
				the city soon had a new, three-story facility. (March 1923)<br>
				<br>
				&quot;Save your Waste Paper and You Save Forests&quot; was the title of a 
				feature story 
				dealing with paper conservation and using paper products again. 
				Collecting, sorting, 
				bailing, and shipping waste papers is a gigantic industry. 
				Pictures accompanied the 
				article and testified to the mountain of paper. The article was 
				written by Past 
				International President O. B. Andrews, owner of a paper mill 
				outside Chattanooga. It 
				was reprinted from Forbes Magazine. (October 1924)<br>
				<br>
				Atlanta, Georgia, presented a 76-acre tract of land to the Girl 
				Scouts. Named Camp 
				Civitania, the land is 10 miles from Atlanta. The camp was 
				developed with a swimming 
				pool, sleeping quarters, and huts built by Civitans and Kiwanis. 
				Civitans also held a 
				meetings at the camp during the summer. (October 1924)<br>
				<br>
				Washington, D. C. financed a Boys' Garden Club for delinquents. 
				Boys were turned 
				over to W. R. Beattie, an official of the Department of 
				Agriculture with an interest in 
				helping youngsters. Each boy was assigned a plot of land and 
				tended the garden, 
				from planting seeds to harvest. It was a successful project that 
				grew annually. 
				(September 1925)<br>
				<br>
				St. Paul, Minnesota, voted to fund completion of one of the 
				children's ward of a new 
				hospital. &quot;November 1925) <br>
				<br>
				Sacramento, California, provided a light spring wagon for odd 
				jobs around the 
				Sacramento orphanage. (December 1925)<br>
				<br>
				Akron, Ohio, joined with Rotary, Kiwanis, Exchange, Lions, and 
				Optimist to provide 
				welcome signs at six prominent locations in the city. (October 
				1926)<br>
				<br>
				A banner headline proclaimed Civitan Club Lands $2,000,000 Mill 
				and $175,000 Hotel 
				for Dalton. The Dalton, Georgia, Club chartered in 1921 and was 
				faced with the lack of 
				a location for a luncheon meeting. The town was booming and 
				lacked any type of 
				accommodation for travelers. A hotel committee was formed, went 
				to work raising 
				money, purchased land, and built the hotel. (December 1926)<br>
				<br>
				An auto race was a big project of Wichita, Kansas -- but it was 
				not a typical race. 
				This one was a race for membership with the Studebaker Big Six 
				against the Chrysler 
				Imperial Eighty. Points were awarded, in terms of miles, for new 
				members and 
				reinstated members. Miles were also awarded for team members at 
				meetings, for ball 
				teams present at games, Civitan and wife attending games, and 
				visitors at luncheons. 
				Penalties were also deducted from points earned for flat tire 
				(member absent), foul 
				spark plug (member late), or out of gas (without name badge). 
				(January 1927)<br>
				<br>
				Greenville and Greer, South Carolina, joined together to sponsor 
				a 100-bed sanitarium 
				to help stamp out tuberculosis. Clubs pledged to contribute 
				$1.00 a day for each 
				charity patient. (February 1927)<br>
				<br>
				Children at the Trumbull County Home enjoyed a special evening 
				of entertainment, 
				compliments of Warren, Ohio, Civitans. They were treated to 
				sandwiches, soft drinks, 
				ice cream and cake, and then enjoyed the Corlett Orchestra. 
				Civitans toured the home 
				after the program. (September 1927)<br>
				<br>
				More than 5,000 toys were distributed to hundreds of 
				underprivileged children by 
				Wichita, Kansas, Civitans for Christmas. They collected new and 
				discarded, but still 
				useable toys the first Monday of December, and encouraged other 
				clubs to adopt 
				similar projects. (December 1927)<br>
				<br>
				Rogersville, Alabama, needed a high school, but cost and 
				location had the local 
				committee deadlocked. After the Rogersville Club chartered, they 
				went to work 
				securing a location and pledged $10,000 and secured $30,000 in 
				additional funds from 
				the state and others citizens of Lauderdale County to build the 
				school. (May 1929)<br>
				<br>
				Birmingham, Alabama, presented the Founders' Cup to Civitan 
				International to 
				recognize the one club performing the most outstanding service 
				to its community. 
				(July 1929)<br>
				<br>
				Winston-Salem, North Carolina, started libraries in the city's 
				public schools. 
				(September 1929)<br>
				<br>
				Dallas, Texas, provided swimming suits for several hundred 
				undernourished 
				youngsters under the age of 12 who attend the children's rest 
				camp. (September 1929)<br>
				<br>
				Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, took 67 &quot;problem boys&quot; in hand and gave 
				them two 
				glorious weeks at the YMCA camp. (November 29)<br>
				<br>
				International Club Growth<br>
				<br>
				In the early years of Civitan International, growth was an 
				important goal to 
				Civitan leaders. As word of what Birmingham Civitans were 
				accomplishing 
				spread to other cities, the foundation group sent members to 
				other cities to talk 
				about Civitan and to form clubs. Later Civitan would form a 
				network of field 
				representatives to charter clubs in distant cities.<br>
				<br>
				Civitan's first club outside of the United States was chartered 
				in Geneva, 
				Switzerland, in 1922. In May of 1925 the Hamilton, Ontario, 
				Canada, Civitan Club 
				was chartered. Both of these clubs failed to survive the 
				Depression years, but 
				Canada came back strong in 1932, this time firmly established 
				with the Toronto 
				Civitan Club.<br>
				<br>
				Civitan K. Y. Benson, a former president of the Birmingham 
				Civitan Club, moved 
				to Toronto because of his business. He felt that when the time 
				was right, he 
				would get a club started there. With the help of Major Frank M. 
				Brown, one of 
				Toronto's foremost citizens, they got a select group together to 
				hear 
				International Secretary Arthur Cundy tell the Civitan story. The 
				group went to 
				work getting more prominent citizens together and they were 
				finally ready for 
				charter.<br>
				<br>
				On January 25, 1932, Cundy again traveled to Toronto and 
				presented them with 
				Charter 264 at the King Edward Hotel. Officers of the club 
				included Frank M. 
				Brown, president; K. Y. Benson, secretary-treasurer; and Fred 
				Halls and A. J. 
				Walker, vice presidents.<br>
				<br>
				Civitan was now in two nations - Canada and the United States. 
				In the following 
				years, due in part to the high cost of maintaining clubs in 
				foreign countries and 
				worldwide conditions, Civitan would concentrate on Canada and 
				the United 
				States for growth. It would take Civitan 37 years to venture 
				outside North 
				America, crossing the Atlantic to Norway.<br>
				<br>
				Now Under Four Flags was the banner headline proclaiming the 
				chartering of 
				the Oslo, Norway, and Monterrey, Mexico, Civitan clubs in the 
				October 1969 
				issue of Civitan Magazine. A group of men interested in joining 
				a major service 
				organization had looked into various groups, deciding on 
				Civitan.<br>
				<br>
				Civitans attending the May 30 ceremonies in Oslo were 
				International President 
				Eddie Lunn of Nashville, Tennessee, Executive Administrator 
				Rudolph T. 
				Hubbard, and John L. Badeau of Birmingham, Alabama; and J. D. 
				Blackburn of 
				Kingsport, Tennessee. They were accompanied by their spouses. 
				The Mother 
				Club of Civitan International, Birmingham, Alabama, sponsored 
				the Oslo Club.<br>
				<br>
				A formal banquet with Master of Ceremonies Kai E. Roland, a 
				former Civitan 
				from Portland, Oregon, got the new club off to a good start. 
				Charter officers 
				were Trygve Klinkenberg, president; Einar Barnes, vice 
				president; Otto 
				Munthe-Kass Pay, secretary; and Anders Rustad, treasurer.<br>
				<br>
				The Monterrey, Mexico, Club chartered June 20. President Eddie 
				Lunn and 
				International Vice President Bill Haehnel and their wives were 
				greeted at the 
				Monterrey Airport by an enthusiastic group of Texas and Mexican 
				Civitans.<br>
				<br>
				Texas District Governor Jack Blackmon presented the charter to 
				Rev. Drew 
				Wolcott, president of the new club. Lunn installed officers and 
				Haehnel initiated 
				members. Officers were: Wolcott, president; Bart Espinosa, Mario 
				Serrano, and 
				Ramiro de la Garza, vice presidents; Oscar Salinas, secretary; 
				and Sergio Gardea, 
				treasurer.<br>
				<br>
				Norwegian Civitans went to work, growing not only in Norway, but 
				adding 
				other countries. In January 1970, the Hannover, Germany, Club 
				chartered, 
				followed in just a few months by the Stockholm, Sweden, Club in 
				June.<br>
				<br>
				In 1974, Atlanta, Georgia Civitan Howell Jordan, a career Army 
				officer and 
				former Junior Civitan, was transferred from Fort MacPherson, 
				Georgia, to Seoul, 
				Korea. Before leaving for his new post, Georgia North District 
				Governor-elect 
				Dick Lang asked Jordan to establish a new Civitan club in Korea.<br>
				<br>
				Jordan sought outstanding Korean business and professional 
				people and 
				quickly connected with Dr. Young Seek Choue, an internationally 
				known 
				educator, author and president of Kyung Hee University. The 
				Seoul Civitan 
				Club chartered in August 1974.<br>
				<br>
				Officers of the club were assisted by American servicemen. The 
				charter officers 
				were: Kim Dong Up, president; Joseph Len, vice president; Yi In 
				Su, secretary; 
				and Chin Tae Chong, treasurer.<br>
				<br>
				Yoshio Nishimoto, an executive with the Coca-Cola Company, was 
				transferred 
				from Atlanta, Georgia, back to his native Japan. While in 
				Atlanta, Nishimoto was 
				a member of the Sandy Springs Civitan Club. In Japan he went to 
				work to build a 
				club, and the Nippon Civitan Club chartered in June 1975.<br>
				<br>
				The Nippon Club chartered with two experienced Civitans -- 
				Nishimoto and Dr. 
				Makoto Hara, a professor of economics at Tokyo Gaku Gei 
				University. Hara had 
				taught at the University of North Carolina. <br>
				<br>
				Civitan International President M. M. Richards attended the 
				charter ceremonies. 
				Yoshio Nishimoto was the charter president of the new club. 
				Growth in the 
				Orient would be slow, but steady, and clubs continue to charter 
				with the elite in 
				business and professional men and women.<br>
				<br>
				In 1989, Bangladesh was added to the roster of Civitan nations. 
				Five clubs were 
				chartered in and around the capitol city of Dhaka, principally 
				through the work 
				of Towhid Hasan Kibria, who is general secretary of the area.<br>
				<br>
				The year 1990 would see two additional nations -- Denmark and 
				Hungary joined 
				the world of Civitan.<br>
				<br>
				Denmark was the natural outgrowth of expansion efforts by 
				Civitan's European 
				Division. Saeby, Denmark, chartered in April, 1991 through the 
				efforts of club 
				builders Ingegjerd Birkeland, John Gunnar Gregerson, and Vagn 
				Sorensen.<br>
				<br>
				Gyor and Tet, Hungary, chartered on September 18 and 19, 1991, 
				through the 
				effort of one Civitan, Ferenc Relle, an Eastern Columbus, Ohio, 
				member who had 
				dreamed of seeing Civitan in his homeland for many years. Relle 
				is a past 
				governor of the Ohio District.<br>
				<br>
				It all started in Birmingham, Alabama, but it is spreading 
				around the world. 
				Civitan was the dream, the gift of our founders to the world. It 
				is a rich heritage, 
				a proud heritage for us to pass on, just as Shropshire and those 
				early leaders 
				passed it on to you and to me.<br>
