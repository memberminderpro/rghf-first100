		insistence on keeping to a single member for each classification led 
		indirectly to the formation of the 'Stand Together Club' in Kansas City, 
		Missouri, by Dr George W. Smith in 1912. The classification of 
		'physician' had already been filled in the Kansas City Rotary Club, so 
		Smith started a new club with the motto of 'SERvice TO MAnkind'. This, 
		after a first change of name to 'Co-operative Clubs', was adopted in 
		1950 as the organisation's title 'SERTOMA' with the motto 'Make Life 
		Worthwhile'. Operating on a similar model to Rotary with districts and 
		regions (zones) and a charitable Foundation, Sertoma is now almost 
		exclusively confined to North and Central America, but with its 
		headquarters still based in Kansas City. Like Rotary it has now become a 
		dual gender organisation.<br>Rotary was well aware that strict adherence 
		to classification rules and limitations on club size might be barriers 
		to increasing membership. In the 'Manual of Procedure' in the early 
		1920s, appears the comment: &quot;And then, too, other similar organisations 
		with no such restriction, usually profit at the expense of he Rotary 
		Club having this limitation.&quot; There was also a feeling that Rotary 
		appealed mainly to the older and more senior members of the community.<br>
		<br>This latter concern was met with by another organisation which was 
		started directly by Rotarians 'Round Table'. In 1927, Louis Marchesi of 
		the Norwich Rotary Club had realised that there was a need for a club 
		with similar ideals to Rotary but catering for young business and 
		professional men (up to the age of 40) who were not yet at a level where 
		they were eligible for the older organisation. The inaugural meeting was 
		well attended and so the new club came into being with Marchesi as 
		Secretary and other Rotarians among its officers. The first club was 
		soon followed by a second and then several more. On May 25, 1928, the 
		National Association of Round Table Clubs was formed at a meeting held 
		at Rotary's London offices and the RIBI conference of 1928 actually 
		passed a motion &quot;That this conference recommends the Rotarians of Great 
		Britain and Ireland to foster the promotion ..of clubs of young business 
		and professional men similar to the Norwich Round Table Club&quot; . Round 
		Table subsequently became an international organisation in its own right 
		and has no direct connection with Rotary although many British Rotarians 
		were originally Tablers, and there is often local co-operation. Another 
		organisation for younger business men called the 'Young Men's 
		Progressive Civic Association' had been formed in St Louis, Missouri, by 
		Henry Giessenbier in 1915 which subsequently became the Jaycees or 
		Junior Chamber of Commerce in America, and later in other countries. 
		This was in effect an earlier attempt to do the same as Round Table but 
		without Rotary input.<br><br>In Canada, the need for a younger club was 
		also seen by Hal Rogers whose father was a Rotarian. He created the 
		KInsmen Club in Hamilton, Ontario, for the 21-40 age group in 1920 and 
		this led to others throughout Canada. Paul Claiburne of Auburn, 
		California had a similar idea in 1922 and he formed a '20-30 Club' in 
		Sacramento. With help from Rotary headquarters, and the local Rotary 
		club, a second '20-30 Club' was started in Stockton, California, and 
		others soon afterwards. Both of these organisations had ideals similar 
		to those of Rotary but were restricted to North America.<br><br>The 
		second of the big three of international service organisations is the 
		Lions whose membership was slightly more open than Rotary or Kiwanis. It 
		was started in 1917 by Melvyn Jones, a young insurance man, who sought 
		to bring into one organisation several independent groups of business 
		and professional men which had been started in the wake of Rotary's 
		success. At Dallas in October 1917 a convention of some 25 such clubs 
		adopted the motto 'We Serve' and formed themselves into Lions 
		International. Comparable in size and spread to Rotary, this 
		organisation also has its headquarters in Chicago. In 1933, Paul Harris' 
		brother Reginald actually took up a field position in Lions 
		International<br>The third of the big three international service 
		organisations, dedicated to 'Serving the children of the world', is 
		Kiwanis International. Kiwanis was started by Allen Browne, a 
		professional organiser of groups, who, in 1914, wanted to start a new 
		kind of organisation for business and professional men in Detroit, 
		Michigan. The first club there began life in January 1915 and was soon 
		followed by many more throughout the United States and Canada. Similar 
		again to Rotary, Kiwanis also faced the problem early on as to whether 
		their prime purpose was mutual business benefits for members or 
		community service. In 1921 the membership adopted clear cut policies of 
		'Service'. Today, Kiwanis has grown into an international service 
		organisation about half the size of Rotary and represented in perhaps 
		half the number of countries.<br><br>It is interesting to note that all 
		these organisations have mottos which involve 'Service' and clearly 
		indicate the underlying ideals behind all of them. Another similarity 
		concerned 'paid' or 'field organisers'. These were people who took pay 
		for starting clubs or recruiting members. The case of Stuart Morrow in 
		Rotary is recorded at our section of Rotary's early leaders. Kiwanis had 
		a problem with their founder, Allen Browne, who actually owned rights in 
		the organisation. In 1919 he had to be paid off at a cost of $17,500!<br>
		<br>There are several other organisations throughout the world which 
		cater for both single and dual gender membership. A few exist in more 
		than one country but the big three international organisations remain 
		Rotary,<br><br>

		<br>Although these three were for men only, there was a recognition that 
		a similar organisation was needed for women. Some of these are detailed 
		elsewhere.</td>
