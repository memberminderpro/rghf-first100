		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/history/history/otherorganizations/easterseals/images/allen.jpg" style="float: left">It 
		must be pointed out that Rotary International was never officially 
		connected to any crippled children’s society. The position of RI was to 
		encourage and help each autonomous Rotary Club to pursue projects, which 
		helped the handicapped. In many areas of the country, significant work 
		was also done through Kiwanis, woman’s organizations, veteran’s groups, 
		churches, and fraternal organizations. <br><br>Principal Participants:<br>
		Edgar D. &quot;Daddy&quot; Allen moved from Newton, Massachusetts to Ohio in 1887 
		and married Blanch Wood in 1888. They had two sons: Homer who died of 
		injuries in the 1907 streetcar accident and Frank who became an 
		industrialist in the Philadelphia area.<br><br>Allen founded the 
		Cleveland Cedar Co. in 1888 for the production of railroad ties and 
		utility poles. He sold that business in 1905, moved to Elyria and had a 
		major interest in the Perry-Fay Co. (now a division. of 
		Parker-Hannifin), the American Lace Co., Dean Electric Co., and was on 
		the board of a number of local industries.<br><br>He was treasurer and 
		manager of the Elyria Memorial Hospital for 14 years, a voluntary 
		position.<br><br>He was a leader of the YMCA campaign in 1911 and, in 
		1918, was one of the founders of the Community Chest that later became 
		the model for forming the United Fund.<br><br>Allen was the first 
		President of the Ohio Society for Crippled Children and the National 
		Crippled Children’s Society (U.S.).<br><br>He is credited with the 
		formulation the “Ohio Plan,” a plan to aid crippled children. He 
		presented this plan to countless audiences. His addresses were entitled; 
		“Is It Worthwhile?” and he coined the phrase, “Keep on keeping on.” He 
		led the organization of the International Society for Crippled Children 
		and was its President from its inception until 1934. He became fondly 
		known as “Daddy” Allen.<br><br>Two versions exist as to the origination 
		of the name. A crippled child patient at Gates Hospital named Jimmie 
		referred to Allen as his “Daddy” and the name was attached to Allen from 
		then on. The other use of “Daddy” was by Ed Kelsey (a District Governor 
		from Toledo) when introducing Allen referred to him as the “Daddy” 
		(founding father) of the movement.<br><br>Allen was made an honorary 
		member of the Elyria Rotary Club on 5/6/1919 and changed to active 
		membership in 1921. His classification at first was &quot;Capitalist,&quot; later 
		changed to “Crippled Children’s Societies.”<br><br>SAMUEL SQUIRE: Born 
		in Elyria 9/1/1873 died 4/18/1943.<br><br>He started with the First 
		National Bank of Elyria in 1892 as a messenger boy. FNB merged with 
		Lorain County Bank in 1922, Squire becoming Vice President and then 
		President of the bank. In 1935, Squire was named the Superintendent of 
		Ohio Banking. He ended his career as President of the Tiffin National 
		Bank.<br><br>A charter member of ERC in 1918, he assumed the presidency 
		in July when the first president was called into military service.<br>
		<br>Squire served as Governor of Rotary District 10 from 7/1/19 to 
		6/30/20. There were 746 Rotary clubs in 17 countries in 1920. He was a 
		dedicated spokesman for the Crippled Children’s Societies. In 1924 he 
		was named President Emeritus of ERC and was named an honorary member in 
		1935.<br><br>Squire was active in community affairs including the 
		Community Chest, YMCA, and the Chamber of Commerce.<br><br>HARRY H. 
		HOWETT: He came to the attention of the OSCC when he was the director of 
		the Ohio Board of State Charities in Columbus. Howett was later 
		appointed director of all Ohio State Welfare agencies. In December 1924 
		he accepted the dual responsibilities of Executive Director of the OSCC 
		and Executive Secretary of the International Society for Crippled 
		Children. He worked with these two organizations for many years and was 
		a key person in the implementation of the “Ohio Plan.” He joined the 
		Elyria Rotary Club in 1924 and was a member until his death in the late 
		1960s.<br><br>ED KELSEY: Toledo Rotarian, District Governor, one of the 
		spokesmen for OSCC in its formative years.<br><br>ARCH KLUMPH: Cleveland

		encourage Elyria Rotary to enlist other clubs in joining the crippled 
		children’s project.<br><br>PAUL HARRIS: Founder of Rotary International. 
		In 1921/22 he encouraged Rotary’s leadership in the formation of a 
		National (U. S.) and then international Crippled Children’s Societies. 
		He attended a number of meetings of the ISCC, including at least four in 
		Elyria.<br><br>BEN HINDMAN: First ERC Secretary and charter member of 
		ERC. Served the OSCC as Recording Secretary during its formative times.<br>
		<br>E. J. (JAY) HOWENSTINE: ERC charter member. He was active in the 
		formation and the programs of OSCC. He authored bulletins and made 
		presentations for the OSCC's Children’s Week promotion. And was 
		instrumental in the production of the first Society informational 
		magazine.<br><br>Chronology<br><br>1905: Paul Harris founded Rotary in 
		Chicago. The purpose was to perform community service, have business 
		classifications, and provide fraternity and fellowship for members. An 
		early project of Rotary Clubs for helping under privileged boys was 
		referred to as “Boys Work.”<br><br>

		an additional car was following the regular one. The motorman of the 
		second car failed to notice the first car making an unscheduled stop to 
		let off passengers at Fifth Street and rammed into the stopped 
		streetcar. Eight died of injuries including E. F. Allen’s son Homer. In 
		addition, seven lost one or both legs or feet. Ten others recovered from 
		severe injuries. Inadequate hospital facilities were cited for some of 
		the deaths and poor treatment of the injuries.<br><br>

		of the organization to the International Society of Crippled Children. 
		Sponsoring clubs were asked to contribute 50 cents per member as dues to 
		the Society. Ohio clubs were already contributing $4.00 per member to 
		the OSCC.<br><br>April 26, 1922: It was reported that most Rotary 
		District Conferences had as part of the program a section on the
