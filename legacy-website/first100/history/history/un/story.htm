		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/history/rip/images/1945warren.jpg" style="float: left">The tragic impact of two World 
		Wars within the fifty-year life-span of Rotary has directed the thoughts 
		of many leaders toward the age- old problem of discovering some method 
		by which international questions might be settled without resort to 
		bloodshed. Symptomatic of this interest was the Rotary conference called 
		in London early in 1942, which succeeded in assembling ministers of 
		education and observers of twenty-one governments—many of whom were then 
		in exile in London—for the purpose of considering the organization of a 
		vast educational and cultural exchange after the conclusion of the war. 
		Later, in that same year, the same group began laying plans for UNESCO.<br>
		<br>Rotary International issued, under the title of “Essentials for an 
		Enduring World Order,” two booklets setting forth articles interpreting 
		the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals. The principal objective was to stimulate 
		discussion by Rotarians everywhere on the newly proposed world 
		organization. Two pamphlets entitled “Pattern for San Francisco” and 
		“The Bretton Woods Proposals” also were sent to all clubs, with the 
		result that the proposals were widely discussed.<br><br>At the 
		organization conference of the United Nations held in San Francisco in 
		1945, the United States delegation invited Rotary International to 
		appoint consultants. Eleven prominent Rotarians served in this capacity 
		with resulting influence on the humane aspects of the Charter. In 
		particular, Article 71 of the United Nations Charter attests this 
		influence:<br><br>The Economic and Social Council may make suitable 
		arrangements for consultation with non-governmental organizations which 
		are concerned with matters within its competence.<br><br>
		Subsequently, Rotary International was granted consultative status, and 
		through the years prominent Rotarians have served as observers at 
		various important meetings. The right to make proposals has not been 
		exercised, how ever, since Rotary International cannot claim to know the 
		opinions of all Rotarians generally on particular questions. The main 
		role, which has been exercised with great effectiveness, has been in the 
		wide dissemination of information about the United Nations.<br><br>Even 
		before the United Nations was firmly established, Rotary’s president, T. 
		A. Warren, had proclaimed a week in October of 1945 as “United Nations 
		Week” for simultaneous observance by Rotary clubs in all parts of the 
		world, for the purpose of spreading knowledge of the United Nations. 
		This observance was continued with growing scope and intensity from year 
		to year. In 1953, its designation was changed to “World Fellowship Week 
		in Rotary Service” which now includes United<br>Nations Day—24 
		October—as fixed by the United Nations General Assembly.<br><br>A great variety of activities have 
		distinguished this observance. Dinners, school assemblies, public
		forums, essay contests, parades, exhibits, folk and film festivals, 
		distribution of literature, and special programs at Rotary club meetings 
		during the week. One feature has been the linking by correspondence of 
		innumerable Rotary clubs with clubs in other countries. Out of this vast 
		correspondence has come much that is good, not to mention a sympathetic 
		understanding of mutual problems.<br><br>

		objective -- in this instance a program in observance of United Nations 
		Day.<br><br>

		critical and explanatory articles by prominent spokesmen. From Here On! 
		— a 124-page commentary on the United Nations Charter — was published in 
		seven successive editions with a total distribution of close to a 
		quarter million copies.<br><br>In the Minds of Men, a booklet dealing 
		with UNESCO, was acclaimed by the deputy-director general of that 
		organization, as the best commentary on the constitution then available. 
		Its successor, The World at Work was similarly acclaimed by many school 
		officials. Stimulation of teaching about the United Nations in local 
		schools became a popular and widespread project of Rotary clubs. The 
		Report on U.N. by Rotary International was published monthly for five 
		years, 1947—1952. It was an unbiased, objective recording of outstanding 
		events, and attained a circulation of 50,000 in English, French, and 
		Spanish editions.<br><br>One of the most effective projects was, and 
		still is, the sponsoring by Rotary clubs in their local schools of mock 
		sessions of the United Nations. Students represent delegates from member 
		nations and debate seriously the great questions of the hour. Literature 
		on this subject as well as other projects, prepared by Rotary 
		International, has been in constant demand by other organizations.<br>
		<br>Rotary International shared with the Carnegie Foundation the cost of 
		maintaining fifty students, many of them Rotary Foundation Fellows, for 
		an eight-week period at the Head quarters of the United Nations, so that 
		these students might have a first-hand knowledge of the work of the 
		organization. This project was continued for two years.<br><br>Radio 
		programs on the U.N.<br><br>Many radio programs built around the United 
		Nations have been sponsored by Rotary clubs in the United States and 
		Canada through the co of local radio stations. These programs followed 
		largely the pattern of panel discussions. The scripts were provided by 
		Rotary International. Subjects included the international exchange of 
		ideas and goods, disarmament, aid to under-developed countries, and many 
		other topics of broad human interest. The stations contributed the time 
		as a public service and the prominence of the participants in many of 
		these discussions—in one notable instance a bishop, the editor of a 
		metropolitan daily, and the president of a university—insured an 
		audience of many millions.<br><br>Statement of Policy—Adopted by the 
		board of directors of Rotary International in 1952, and confirmed in 
		1954, is the following statement of policy relating to the United 
		Nations:<br><br>While Rotary International neither gives nor with holds 
		endorsement of the provisions of the United Nations Charter, nor of the 
		actions or enactments of the United Nations, it does encourage Rotarians 
		to acquaint themselves with the activities of the United Nations 
		directed to the advancement of world peace.<br><br>The secretary is 
		instructed to bring to the attention of Rotary clubs program information 
		and other helps in connection with the study of the charter and the 
		activities of the United Nations to the advancement of world peace.<br>
		<br>Continued publicity shall be given to the reports of the observers 
		for Rotary International who attend the meetings of the United Nations 
		and its specialized agencies.<br><br>Rotarians desiring to make a 
		proposal concerning the United Nations or any of its specialized 
		agencies should function through the duly constituted governmental 
		channels of their own country.<br><br>This is not the whole story of the 
		United Nations and Rotary. The whole story can never be told—for it has 
		to do with the quiet influence of many Rotarians who were members of the 
		various delegations, men who exercised leadership in the many 
		discussions when the charter was being formulated. Such men as Paul 
		Henri Spaak, of Belgium, who was to serve as president of the General 
		Assembly, a long-time honorary member of the Rotary Club of Brussels. 
		And Fans El-Khouri, of Syria, one of the signers for Syria of the 
		charter, now a member of the International Law Commission of the U.N., 
		the founder of the Rotary Club of Damascus.<br><br>Also there should be 
		noted the name of Warren R. Austin, for many years the distinguished 
		head of the United States delegation to the U.N., a charter member and 
		first president of the Rotary club of his home town in Burlington, 
		Vermont.<br><br>Another signer of the charter is also a former 
		vice-president of Rotary International, Carlos<br>P. Romulo, of the 
		Philippines, a long-time member of the Rotary Club of Manila, who also 
		served as president of the General Assembly.<br>The message which he 
		sent to his club while serving U.N. in that important capacity might 
		well stand as a concluding note to this recital of Rotary’s contribution 
		to a world organization for law and order and justice to all peoples 
		everywhere. This is the message that he sent:<br><br>&quot;GOODWILL — the 
		core of every Rotarian’s service to his community — is one of the very 
		essentials of this Union of States. Without good will, no international 
		agreement is possible. To this end, I propose, in the best tradition of 
		good will known to Rotary to discharge the delicate and multifarious 
		duties of my present office. I make public avowal of Rotary influence in 
		having enriched my international outlook and human under standing, and 
		in thus having helped to prepare me for this difficult responsibility.<br>
		I send you my most heartfelt Mebuhay, confident that you will carry on 
		with faith and optimism. To you, as the poet said, I hand the torch; be 
		yours to hold it high.&quot;</td>
