        <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">One thorny issue, which 
        if not constitutional, nevertheless existed for many years, concerned a 
        <b>club's territory</b>. In order to safeguard clubs from poaching, it was 
        agreed that there should be 'territorial limits' for each club. Thus, 
        for example, all Manchester Rotarians had to have offices or live within 
        the boundaries of the city, and no other club could take members from 
        within those geographical limits. This did not matter in the early days 
        of Rotary when clubs were few and far between. However, as Rotary grew, 
        it became a problem. In the USA particularly, there were and still are 
        some city center clubs who were unwilling to cede territory in the past 
        and had therefore become very large. For many years the Chicago Number 
        One and New York clubs were in this position.</font></span></p>

        <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">From early in its 
        history, Rotary had formed an 'Extension Committee' dedicated to 
        enlarging the movement but its prime purpose was to develop new 
        countries and new cities. In 1919, the board was authorized to establish 
        special rules and regulations to cover extension. It was already one of 
        the Articles of the Association-number 2 section 1- &quot;to encourage, 
        promote and supervise the organization of Rotary Clubs in all commercial 
        centers throughout the world.&quot; A list submitted to the 1921 Convention 
        (page 201) clearly indicates the lines on which the committee was 
        thinking, with extension planned for cities such as Bordeaux, Antwerp, 
        Marseilles and Amsterdam, all-important 'commercial centers'. In a long 
        and diverse discussion at Edinburgh, there was no mention of the 
        creation of extra city clubs.</font></span></p>

        <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The single member 
        classification rule had already led to the creation of 'rival' 
        organizations such as <b><a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/history/history/otherorganizations/sertoma">
        <font color="#0000FF">Sertoma</font></a></b>, (QV) founded by a Kansas City physician 
        who was unable to join Rotary because his classification was already 
        filled. Nevertheless, most big city clubs were unwilling to cede 
        territory to allow extra clubs to absorb potential members in categories 
        already filled, and there appears to have been little guidance from the 
        top at this time to suggest that they should. In fact, Rotarians 
        frequently recommended work colleagues to other organizations such as 
        Kiwanis, Lions and Sertoma when their own classification in Rotary was 
        already taken. The introduction of the 'Second Active Member' was but a 
        small step towards alleviating the position.</font></font></span></p>

        <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">It was probably in 
        Britain that the matter of extension by allowing the ceding of urban 
        territory to new clubs was first raised. In the early part of the 1920s, 
        the British magazine 'Rotary' had been carrying regular letters 
        attacking the single classification system which was considered 
        restrictive. In one issue, W. H. Alexander, Past President of the BARC 
        in 1915, wrote &quot;the remedy is to be found...in additional clubs in our 
        large centers of population as is being done in London at the present 
        time.&quot; He was referring to the decision of the London Club, inspired by 
        Arthur Chadwick, PRIBI 1928, and Ted Unwin, that &quot;the time had arrived 
        when by delimitation of its own area, it should be made possible for 
        other clubs to be formed in the Metropolis.&quot; The London Club Council 
        made this decision in 1921 and the relevant geographical area defined in 
        1923. This re-alignment of its area was ratified at the St Louis 
        Convention the same year. </font></span></p>

        months, among them St Pancras, Upper Norwood 
        and Chiswick, so that by January 1, 1925, there were nearly a dozen 
        clubs in the former London territorial area. A few years later, in 1934, 
        Paul Harris was pleased to visit the Streatham Club accompanied by Ted

        <font color="#0000FF">Stanley Leverton of the London Club</font></a></b>, PRIBI 1952, visited the 
        HQ of Rotary in Chicago in 1927 as a member of the International 
        Extension Committee and was less than happy with what he saw as a 
        developing centralization. He asked whether there might not be a &quot;a 
        danger that you will over-organize and over-develop?&quot; Returning home, he 
        put forward to RI the idea that one club, especially a large club formed 
        to serve a great city, could share recruiting rights within its limits 
        with new clubs, formed with smaller geographical areas inside those 
        limits. In practice, this was already being done in Britain. These views 
        of Leverton became known as 'The Leverton Plan' but were not adopted as 
        part of the Rotary Constitution until 1943. Despite this, the problem 
        still existed in a handful of areas until recently with some very large 
        clubs in city centers and only a few suburban clubs in the same 
        Metropolitan area.</font></span></p>

        <span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">However, in 2001 
        there was a major change. Prior to the Council on Legislation held in 
        Chicago in April 2001, the RI Constitution did not allow more than one 
        club to be admitted to membership from any one city, borough or 
        municipal area &quot;except as otherwise provided in the bylaws.&quot; The bylaws 
        allowed for more than one club within the &quot;territorial limits&quot; only if 
        the majority of clubs already within the territory so approved and the 
        rules for allowing such sharing of territory were set out in 6 
        complicated paragraphs contained in the RI bylaws. This led to many 
        instances of clubs &quot;protecting&quot; their own areas and potential 
        membership, and refusing to allow new clubs to be formed. Thus, in 
        District 1270, these territorial rules held up the formation of the 
        Rotary Club of Stainborough for nearly 2 years.</font></font></span></p>
