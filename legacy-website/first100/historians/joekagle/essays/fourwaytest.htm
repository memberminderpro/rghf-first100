	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">A man that I respect in his 
		wisdom, Warren Buffet, once said: “You never know if a man is naked 
		until the tide goes out.” Rotary’s Four-Way Test is a means to find out 
		the merit of a man or woman through their behavior and successful deeds 
		in their community. One can hold this simple test up to all kind of 
		actions and experiences which reveals the worth of that person and those 
		around him or her. There are some key words in that test: Truth, 
		Goodwill and Friendship, Beneficial, Think, Say, Do and, most important, 
		Fair. As a Texan who was born in Pennsylvania, I went to memorable, 
		historic figures from my adopted state and a few others that Texans call 
		their own (although they come from other places) for issues related to 
		this Four-Way Test. As a fellow Rotarian remarked, “After reviewing 
		their words, I can only come to one conclusion: Texans are thinkers, 
		talkers and especially doers.” Also he came to this added conclusion: 
		“…the Four-Way Test should not be solely a measuring stick against which 
		proposed actions are measured. While it is certainly easy to be truthful 
		and fair when you do nothing, how can you build goodwill and better 
		friendship and be beneficial to all concerned when nothing is 
		accomplished.” Like “Service Above Self”, the Four-Way Test calls us to 
		action to improve our community. If you don’t remember another thing 
		about the Four-Way Test, you should take to heart the famous words of 
		that great American and Texan who served as Speaker of the United States 
		House of Representatives for sixteen years, longer than any other 
		person, Sam Rayborn, when he said: “Any jackass can kick down a barn, 
		but it takes a good carpenter to build one.” To move to the future, 
		Service Above Self must wed itself to Service Without Borders. That is 
		the next challenge and the Four-Way Test is a good tool for that 
		journey.<br><br>Let’s take the Four-Way Test apart to key words and add 
		the thoughts of special people:<br><br><strong>TRUTH</strong> <br><br>
		Dizzy Dean and Oscar Wilde: “It ain’t braggin’ if you can back it up.”<br>
		<br>Will Rogers: “If you ever injected truth into politics you have no 
		politics.”<br><br>Phil Gramm: “I have the reliable friend you can have 
		in American politics, and that is ready money.”<br><br>Cochese: “You 
		must speak straight so that your words may go as sunlight into our 
		heart.”<br><br>Chief Joseph, Nez Perce: “It does not require many words 
		to speak the truth.”<br><br>Mark Twain: “Truth is tough. It will not 
		break, like a bubble, at a touch; nay, you may kick it about all day, 
		like a football, and it will be round and full at evening.”<br><br>
		Walter Cronkite: “In seeking truth, you have to get both sides of a 
		story.”<br><br>“And that’s the way it is.”<br><br>Sam Rayborn: “If you 
		simply tell the truth, you’ll never get mixed up. Then you don’t have to 
		remember what you’ve said.”<br><br>Dan Rather: “The dream begins with a 
		teacher who believes in you, who tugs and pushes and leads you to the 
		next plateau, sometimes poking you with a sharp stick called “truth.”<br>
		<br><strong>GOODWILL AND FRIENDSHIPS</strong><br><br>Lyndon Baines 
		Johnson: “If we must disagree, let’s disagree without being 
		disagreeable.” “You’ve got to work things out in the cloakroom, and when 
		you’ve got them worked out, you can debate a little before you vote.”<br>
		<br>Mary Kay Ash: “Sandwich every bit of criticism between two heavy 
		layers of praise.”<br><br>Mark Twain: “Kindness is the language which 
		the deaf can hear and the blind can see.”<br><br>Barbara Bush: “Nobody 
		is perfect. Look for the good in others. Forget the rest.”<br><br>
		“Remember loyalty is a two-way street.”<br><br>Sam Rayborn: “If you want 
		to get along, go along.”<br><br>Babe Didrikson Zaharias: “Winning has 
		always meant much to me, but winning friends has meant more.”<br><br>
		<strong>BENEFICIAL</strong><br><br>Stepher F. Austin: (His self-styled 
		epitaph, December 27, 1836) “The prosperty of Texas has been the object 
		of my labors, the idol of my existence.”<br><br>Davy Crockett: (After 
		losing a congressional election in Tennesee) “As my country no longer 
		needs my services, I have made up my mind to go to Texas.”<br><br>Lyndon 
		Baines Johnson: “Every man has a right to a Saturday night bath.” “Never 
		pass up an opportunity to do an honorable favor for an honest friend.” 
		“Sincerely attempt to heal, on an honest Christian basis, every 
		misunderstanding that you have had or now have. Drain off your 
		grievances.”<br><br>Dwight D. Eisenhower: “You don’t lead by hitting 
		people over the head- that’s assault, not leadership.”<br><br>Stanley 
		Marcus: “The best public relations are based on good deeds.” “People who 
		learn to be service oriented actually derive more pleasure from their 
		work.”<br><br>Mark Twain: “To be good is noble; but to show others how 
		to be good is nobler and no trouble.”<br><br>Sam Rayborn (we can’t use 
		this quote too often): “Any jackass can kick down a barn, but it takes a 
		good carpenter to build one.”<br><br>Note: that last quote may have been 
		the brainchild of one of the following: Ann Richards, Lyndon Baines 
		Johnson, or Phil Gramm, as well as Sam Rayborn who is famous for using 
		it more than the others mentioned.<br><br>Zig Ziglar: “He climbs highest 
		who helps another up.”<br><br>George Jones: “My work? I’m makin’ people 
		happy, and they darn sure make me happy.”<br><br><strong>THINK</strong><br>
		<br>George Jones: “Sometimes the good Lord has to hit us with a 
		sledgehammer to knock some sense into our heads.”<br><br>Lyndon Baines 
		Johnson: “If two men agree on everything, you may be sure that one of 
		them is doing the thinking.” “The hardest task is not to do what is 
		right but to know what is right.”<br><br>Barbara Jordan: “Do not call 
		for black power or green power. Call for brain power.”<br><br>Sam 
		Houston: “The benefits of education and of useful knowledge, generally 
		diffused through a community, are essential to the preservation of a 
		free government.”<br><br>Dwight D. Eisenhower: “A people who value 
		privilege above principle will soon lose both.”<br><br>Gen. George S. 
		Patton: “Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and 
		they will surprise you with their ingenuity.”<br><br>Willie Nelson: 
		“Once you replace negative thoughts with positive ones, you’ll start 
		have positive results.”<br><br>Chester W. Nimitz: “God grant me the 
		courage not to give up what I think is right even though I think it is 
		hopeless.”<br><br>Sid Richardson: “My business philosophy? Don’t be in 
		too big a hurry, don’t get exceited, and don’t lose your sense of humor. 
		You can’t be objective and emotional at the same time.”<br><br>Sam 
		Rayborn: “Have faith. It’s contagious.”<br><br>Nolan Ryan: “You can’t 
		have a long, successful career without a positive attitude. A can-do 
		mentality is a pitcher’s best friend.”<br><br>Zig Ziglar: “Negativism is 
		nothing more than the improper use of your imagination.”<br><br><strong>
		SAY</strong><br><br>Bun Phillips: “I don’t mind people thinking I’m 
		stupid, but I don’t want to give them any proof.”<br><br>Lyndon Baines 
		Johnson: “Never miss an opportunity to say a word of congratulations.” 
		“While you’re trying to save face, you’re probably losing your rear.”<br>
		<br>Sam Rayborn: “Don’t ever try to go too fast. Learn your job. Don’t 
		ever talk until you know what you’re talking about.” “No one has a finer 
		command of the language than the person who keeps his mouth shut.”<br>
		<br>Ann Richards: “Timing is everything. Bob Hope owns most of Palm 
		Springs because he knows when not to say anything.”<br><br>Mary Kay Ash: 
		“A mediocre idea that generates enthusiasm will go further than a great 
		idea that inspires no one.”<br><br><strong>DO</strong><br><br>H. L. 
		Hunt: “The more wells you drill, the greater chance you have of finding 
		oil.”<br><br>Lyndon Baines Johnson: “The best fertilizer for a piece of 
		land is the footprints of its owner.” “It’s the price of leadership to 
		do the thing you believe has to be done at the time it must be done.”<br>
		<br>Jim Hightower: “Do something. If it doesn’t work, do something else. 
		No idea is too crazy.”<br><br>Ann Richards: “You can’t wait on life. If 
		you do, you’re living some life that’s “gonna happen” instead of the one 
		that’s happening right now.”<br><br>Phil Gramm: “I love Texas because 
		Texas is future-oriented, because Texans think anything is possible. 
		Texans think big.”<br><br>Roger Staubach: “Spectacular achievements are 
		always preceded by unspectacular preparation.”<br><br>Walter Cronkite: 
		“I never had the ambition to be something. I had the ambition to do 
		something.” “I can’t imagine a person becoming a success who doesn’t 
		give this game of life everything he’s got.”<br><br>Barbara Bush: 
		“Believe in something larger than yourself… Get involved in the big 
		ideas of your time.”<br><br>Mark Twain: “Do the right thing. It will 
		gratify some people and astonish the rest.”<br><br>Joseph Brant, Mohawk: 
		“No person among us desires any other reward for performing a brave and 
		worthy action, but the consciousness of having served his nation.”<br>
		<br>Mary Kay Ash: “Ideas are a dime a dozen. People who implement them 
		are priceless. Nothing great is ever accomplished without 
		follow-through.” “God does not ask your ability or inability. He only 
		asks your availability.”<br><br>Sam Houston: “Courage can achieve 
		everything.”<br><br>Tom Landry: “Leadership is getting someone to do 
		what they don’t want to do, to achieve what they want to achieve.”<br>
		<br><strong>FAIR</strong><br><br>Dwight D. Eisenhower: “I despise people 
		who go to the gutter on either the right or the left and hurl rock at 
		those in the center.”<br><br>Trammel Crow: “Fairness begets fairness, 
		and loyalty begets loyalty, and generosity begets generosity. That’s 
		just the way humans live and work.”<br><br>A fellow Rotarian from the 
		Waco Rotary Club: “Fairness does not always require equality; fairness 
		considers all the circumstances.” (Note: this is the same Rotarian who 
		found a majority of these quotes and I forget his name to give him 
		credit. In fairness, he would forgive me.)<br><br>The Four-Way Test is 
		the “divining rod” to find the beneficial waters for a global community. 
		It is based on deeds well-done. And in this search to DO what is 
		BENEFICIAL and FAIR, it is always important to remember Sam Rayborn’s 
		(or whoever thought it up) well-used statement: “Any jackass can kick 
		down a barn, but it takes a good carpenter to build one.” As we move 
		toward a new era where the world is flat in terms of information and 
		communication (and “Service Without Borders” is the emerging reality 
		that Rotary adds to the Four-Way Test and “Service Above Self”), we need 
		the world’s best carpenters to lead our way.<br><br>Joseph L. Kagle, Jr.</td>
