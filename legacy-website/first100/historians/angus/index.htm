			<p _counted="undefined">James Angus developed his taste for 
			schooling early in life. At the age of three, he regularly snuck 
			into his older brothers' home-schooling lessons. A year later, in 
			1932, he insisted on attending Grade 1 at the wilderness log 
			schoolhouse the families of Big Chute, Ont., had built.</p>
			<!-- /Summary -->
			<p _counted="undefined">When he still hadn't tired of the classroom 
			after two weeks, the teacher allowed him to stay, declaring him the 
			school's best student.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">Over the 59 years that followed, Angus 
			taught in the Arctic, Singapore, Ontario and New Brunswick, and was 
			appointed dean of Ontario's first university-level faculty of 
			education. He is credited with creating the model the province of 
			Ontario followed when it moved teacher-training programs into 
			universities in 1969.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">He died at the age of 82 on June 16 of 
			respiratory failure after breaking his hip.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">Angus, who was born on April 27, 1928, grew 
			up in the woods of the Muskoka region before it became a cottage 
			playground. His father, William (Scotty) Nesbitt Angus, was the 
			federal government's lockmaster at Big Chute, where he oversaw the 
			marine railway that carried boats across a section of the Severn 
			River that had no hydraulic lock. It was part of the 19th-century 
			Trent-Severn Waterway that connected Lake Ontario with Georgian Bay 
			by way of Peterborough and Orillia.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">Big Chute had no road access and only four 
			families lived there. But like Angus' Scottish immigrant parents, 
			the residents wanted their children to have a good education and 
			built a one-room school out of local materials.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">The blackboards were made of slate salvaged 
			from an old pool table. Mary Elizabeth Cowan, the first young 
			teacher whose $800 salary made up most of the $1,200 annual budget, 
			used a pool cue for a pointer, but bought a new 25-cent leather 
			&quot;correction strap&quot; for maintaining discipline among her 16 students.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">Like his three brothers and sister, Angus 
			was sent to Toronto, at 14, to complete his final three years of 
			high school, returning each summer to the woods beside the Severn 
			River to swim, fish, pick berries and catch bait for local 
			fishermen.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">Upon graduation, he attended University of 
			Toronto for a general arts degree, earned his teaching certificate 
			at the Hamilton Normal School and, by 1950, had married nurse Leola 
			Coombs and was teaching at George R. Allan Public School in 
			Hamilton.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">In August, 1952, the young couple took 
			government jobs in the coastal town of Coppermine, now Kuglugtuk in 
			western Nunavut. Angus was a &quot;welfare teacher&quot; in one of the 
			Arctic's seven Inuit community schools; Leola ran the village's 
			nursing station. As a welfare teacher, Angus' job reached beyond the 
			dozen or so students in the classroom. He was required to visit each 
			Inuit family monthly to monitor their living conditions, keep 
			hunting records, organize social events and market local crafts to 
			southern buyers. Having grown up in the backwoods, Angus fit into 
			the isolated community easily.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">Shortly after his arrival, he joined a group 
			on dogsleds to hunt a herd of 75,000 caribou. When his Inuit 
			companion fell ill, he took the man's rifle and shot three animals 
			for him, adding to the day's harvest of 300. At school, he kept a 
			rifle handy in case a flock of ptarmigan came within shooting range 
			of the classroom.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">Recognizing that books about farming and 
			automobiles had no relevance to his students, Angus created his own 
			northern stories, writing them on the board for his students to read 
			aloud.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">Despite the couple's modest housing, their 
			apartment was always open to guests, including Prince Philip who 
			flew in for a morning's tour and a royal lunch in the summer of 1954 
			just before the Anguses finished their two-year stay. Other visitors 
			included government ministers, journalist Pierre Berton and bush 
			pilot Max Ward who had just started Wardair.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">Through the rest of the decade, Angus taught 
			elementary school in Hamilton, St. Catharines and Bolton, Ont., 
			before taking a job as a teaching master at the North Bay Teachers 
			College, the prime source of new teachers for northern Ontario.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">One of his students was Tom Douglas, now an 
			Oakville-based historical writer, who entered teacher training after 
			high school.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">&quot;Most of us found that teachers college was 
			a joke. There were very few classes that taught us how to teach. ... 
			But Jim really taught us the mechanics of being a teacher.&quot;</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">The lessons included a session on how to 
			strap a misbehaving student.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">As a child, Angus had watched teachers stray 
			from the palm and insisted that teachers had to protect the 
			students' wrists with their free hand. &quot;You invariably hit your own 
			fingers by accident and it hurt,&quot; says Douglas.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">A lover of travel, Angus took his family to 
			Singapore for a year in 1961 where he taught science education, 
			emphasizing learning through observation and problem solving rather 
			than rote memorization. After a few more years in North Bay, he 
			moved the family to Edmonton, where he earned a doctorate and then 
			taught education at the University of New Brunswick.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">&quot;We moved so much, people assume I was an 
			army brat,&quot; jokes his son David, an Ottawa lobbyist, who was born in 
			Coppermine in 1953. &quot;He was pretty focused on his schooling.&quot;</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">The frequent address changes ended in 1969 
			with a move to Thunder Bay when Angus was appointed dean of the 
			province's first faculty of education at Lakehead University, an 
			institution he served for the next 21 years.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">Angus arrived as the government was about to 
			hand teacher education over to universities but it was not an easy 
			transition. While the colleges' teaching masters had pedagogical 
			experience, few had graduate degrees and their appointments as 
			professors rankled university faculty who considered them to be 
			under-qualified. Angus' first task was to protect his new faculty 
			during the ensuing academic turf wars.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">When the other Lakehead faculties resisted 
			giving his new faculty autonomy, Angus threatened to resign if his 
			proposals were turned down.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">Eventually he proposed that Lakehead offer a 
			concurrent education program that gave its graduates double degrees 
			- one in education and another in arts or science - in four years. 
			(Alternatively, students with a bachelor degree could earn a B.Ed. 
			in one year.) Angus believed this provided the best of both worlds - 
			a solid, liberal education and effective classroom and curriculum 
			training.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">He later wrote in <i _counted="undefined">
			Schoolroom</i>, his memoir, &quot;With naïve optimism and support from 
			program users, I presented the programs to the Senate's Academic 
			Planning Committee. ... I soon learned how difficult it is to create 
			a new program on a university campus.&quot;</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">Angus' plans were scrutinized critically at 
			all levels, from senior education ministry staff and university 
			presidents across the province to faculty associations, teachers 
			college staffers, and student organizations - each group wanting to 
			protect its own interests. In the end though, his approach became 
			the standard for most of Ontario's new education faculties.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">Later he added a masters degree program and 
			an aboriginal education degree that prepared teachers for work in 
			native communities.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">His marriage did not survive his 10-year 
			term as dean. Midway through the 1970s, the Anguses divorced.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">In 1978, Angus met Patricia Shaw, an Ottawa 
			medical technologist, during a Wardair tour of Greece. Later, he 
			visited her during a research trip to Library and Archives Canada in 
			Ottawa and started a long-distance courtship that lasted until they 
			married in 1980.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">For all his travels and work in education, 
			Angus never lost interest in his father's work at the Big Chute 
			marine railway. After years of research, he wrote
			<i _counted="undefined">A Respectable Ditch</i>, the definitive 
			history of the Trent-Severn Waterway, a transportation route which - 
			due to politics and geography - took 87 years to complete. The book 
			was published by McGill-Queen's University Press.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">&quot;His book is my bible. I use it constantly 
			in my work,&quot; says Parks Canada historian Dennis Carter-Edwards, who 
			is responsible for managing the agency's cultural resources in 
			central Ontario. &quot;It is a delight to pick up and read.&quot;</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">A series of self-published books followed, 
			including a history of 73 mills on the Severn River and
			<i _counted="undefined">A Deo Victoria</i>, the story of a 
			prosperous Georgian Bay Lumber Company. His &quot;Severn Publications&quot; 
			titles sold almost 10,000 books.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">Before retiring to an Orillia condominium 
			with a view of Lake Simcoe in 1994, Angus served for two years as a 
			district governor of Rotary International with responsibility for 
			clubs in northwestern Ontario, North Dakota, Minnesota and 
			Wisconsin. A Rotarian for 40 years, he helped establish student 
			exchanges with China, a water treatment plant in Haiti and a medical 
			outpost in Peru. In 2005, he produced a history of the Canadian 
			Rotary Club.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">In addition to his historical research, he 
			served as president of the Orillia Historical Society, played a 
			crucial role in the creation of the amalgamated Orillia Art and 
			History Museum, and became involved in the rehabilitation of a 
			tumbledown mill in Coldwater, north of Orillia. He estimated he had 
			visited 74 countries.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">His historical expertise won him an 
			appointment to the board of the Heritage Trust of Ontario that he 
			held for eight years until he resigned in 2008 due to Parkinson's 
			disease.</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">&quot;He was a wonderful man and we miss him very 
			much,&quot; says executive director Richard Moorhouse. &quot;What he brought 
			to the board was his love of history and knowledge of the province, 
			along with a wonderful sense of humour and enthusiasm and good 
			judgment. He was able to engage everyone so well because of his 
			teaching background.&quot;</p>
			<p _counted="undefined">Angus leaves his wife Patricia, his son 
			David, three stepdaughters, six grandchildren, eight 
			step-grandchildren and a great-grandchild.</p>
