		of Jimmy Carter“To be just, a war must represent the last resort. It is 
		obvious that other alternatives to war exist.&quot; - Jimmy Carter<br><br>
		Born in Plains, Georgia on 1 October 1924, Jimmy Carter was the son of a 
		farmer and businessman, James Earl Carter and Lillian Gordy Carter, a 
		registered nurse.. Growing up in a religious home environment, he 
		attended local school in Plains, Georgia South Western College and 
		Georgia Institute of Technology. Having held the ambition from age four, 
		to join the Navy, he received an appointment to the US Annapolis Naval 
		Academy in 1942 and entered it the following year. He graduated in 1946 
		with a Bachelor of Science degree and received a commission in the 
		United States Navy.. In that year he married Rosalynn Smith of Plains, 
		Georgia. In 1948 he was accepted for submarine officer training school, 
		at New London, Connecticut and after graduating was posted to the US 
		Pacific Fleet In 1951 he returned to New London as senior officer of the 
		pre-commissioning crew of the K-1, the Navy’s first new ship since the 
		end of World War II. On 1 June 1952, Carter joined the Navy’s elite 
		nuclear submarine programme under Admiral Hyman Rickover and attended 
		the Naval Reactor Branch of the Atomic Energy Commission, in Washington 
		before returning to New London to work on the Navy’s second nuclear 
		submarine, “Seawolf.” At that time also he studied nuclear physics and 
		nuclear reactor design at Union College, New York.<br><br>On the death 
		of his father in 1951, Jimmy Carter received an honourable discharge 
		from the Navy and returned to Plains to manage the family business. 
		After serving in state politics between 1963 and 1975 he defeated Gerald 
		Ford for the US presidency on 2 November 1976. It was during this period 
		that he and Rosalynn experienced a religious reaffirmation and developed 
		a conviction of the need to promote human rights.<br><br>Carter’s 
		presidency occurred at a divisive time in United States domestic 
		politics resulting from the residual bitterness over the Viet Nam War, 
		the events leading up to the resignation of President Nixon and high 
		inflation resulting from high price of oil charged by the OECD nations 
		in retaliation for the treatment of the Palestinians by Israel.. At that 
		time, also, the world was divided into the two opposing camps of 
		Democracy (the West) and Communism (the East). The threat of a nuclear 
		war was ever present and the USA, Britain, France on the one hand and 
		Russia and China on the other, were actively pursuing a nuclear 
		armaments policy The succession of wars between the Arab states and the 
		state of Israel made the Middle East highly volatile. US foreign policy 
		during the Cold War had been one of containment of Communism and 
		President Nixon’s Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger had sought détente 
		with the Soviet Union and China. Kissinger’s efforts towards 
		rapprochement with China failed with the US bombing of North Vietnam. 
		Carter’s National Security Adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, an expert on 
		Communism and the son of a Polish diplomat held the view that the Soviet 
		control of the Eastern European states was weakening and that Communism 
		itself would not survive for too many years. The United States foreign 
		policy under Carter, Brzezinski and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance 
		shifted from containment of the Soviet Union and its satellite nations 
		to emphasis on human rights and peaceful engagement with Eastern 
		Europe..<br><br>US Secretary of Defence and former head of the CIA, 
		Robert Gates in his book “Out of the Shadows” wrote &quot;I believe the 
		Soviets saw a very different Jimmy Carter than did most Americans by 
		1980, different and more hostile and threatening,&quot; Gates wrote. ”His 
		emphasis on human rights made Carter the first president during the Cold 
		War to challenge publicly and consistently the legitimacy of Soviet rule 
		at home.&quot; Those were &quot;the first steps&quot; Gates wrote,” toward the 
		beginning of the end of the Soviet Union,”<br><br>A dialogue had 
		developed between Egypt’s president Anwar Sadat and Israel’s Ytzak Rabin 
		with Sadat travelling to Israel and addressing the Israeli Knesset 
		pushing for the implementation of United nations security Council 
		Resolutions 242 and 338. In 1977 in an endeavour to restart the stalled 
		1973 Geneva Conference Carter travelled to the Middle East for meetings 
		with Sadat, Rabin, King Hussein of Jordan and Hafez Al Assad of Syria. 
		Rabin’s Labour Party government was defeated by Menachem Begin’s Likud 
		Party in the Israeli election and Begin refused to consider giving up 
		the West Bank occupied by Israel. Sadat, Begin and Carter met at the 
		presidential Camp David retreat from 5 - 17 September, 1978. While 
		Carter and Sadat had established a rapport, Begin refused to sit down 
		with Sadat. Carter was forced to discuss a matter first with one and 
		then discuss it again with the other. Brzezinski recorded that “the 
		President is driving himself mercilessly, spending most of his time 
		either debating with the Egyptians or the Israelis or drafting or 
		revising texts that are being submitted to him. He has single-handedly 
		written the proposed document on the Sinai formula.”.<br><br>On 
		September 17 two agreements were signed; the first, “A Framework for 
		Peace in the Middle East,” and the second, “A Framework for the 
		Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel.” The Peace Treaty 
		was signed on 26 March, 1979, returning the Israeli-occupied Sinai 
		Peninsula to Egypt and relations between the two nations were normalised 
		in January, 1980.<br><br>During his presidency, Richard Nixon had taken 
		steps to normalise the relations between the Peoples Republic of China 
		and the United States. During 1977 – 78 Carter engaged in discussions 
		with Chinese officials in Washington and Secretary of State Vance 
		travelled to China for discussions, but without the authority to 
		negotiate any agreements. On 30 January, 1979 Carter and Chinese leader 
		Deng Xiaoping signed the Accords which normalised the relations between 
		the two countries. The simple act of placing two signatures to paper 
		paved the way for mutual economic and trade advantages for both nations, 
		and admitted the Peoples Republic of China to the United Nations 
		Security Council as a permanent member but equally important, was a 
		major step forward in the pursuit of a peaceful world.<br><br>Throughout 
		the Cold War years, the world lived under the threat of the nightmare of 
		a nuclear war between the Soviet dominated Eastern Bloc and the Western 
		powers. Resulting from Carter’s initiatives the Strategic Arms 
		Limitation Treaty, (SALT II) limiting the stockpiles of nuclear weapons 
		to be held by both nations, was signed by Jimmy Carter and Soviet 
		president Leonid Brezhnev on 30 March 1979 in Vienna. Although the 
		agreement was never ratified by the United Sates government, both 
		parties adhered strictly to the agreement.<br><br>Following his defeat 
		by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election, Jimmy Carter 
		returned to Georgia and has become the most active ex president in 
		United States history.<br><br>In 1982 he accepted the position of 
		Distinguished Professor and began teaching at Emory University in 
		Atlanta. In association with the university Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter 
		established the Carter Centre to undertake humanitarian projects not 
		undertaken by other organisations.. The Centre’s central principle is 
		“Everyone on Earth Should be Able to Live in Peace.” Both Jimmy and 
		Rosalynn Carter joined Habitat for Humanity and give up one week of each 
		year to physically work on housing projects for the poor and the 
		homeless. Jimmy Carter is an accomplished woodworker.<br><br>Between 
		1986 and 1991 the Carter Centre assisted the African state of Ghana to 
		become self-sufficient in food production. In 1987 the Centre persuaded 
		the pharmaceutical giant Merck to donate the drug Mectizan.for as long 
		as it may be required in Africa to control River Blindness. It has 
		undertaken conflict resolution in Ethiopia, Eritrea, North Korea. 
		Liberia, Haiti, Bosnia, Sudan, Great Lakes region of Africa, Uganda and 
		Venezuela an Carter himself has been personally involved in much of this 
		work, in addition to which he and the Carter Centre have undertaken 
		election monitoring work in Panama, Nicuragua, Guyana, China, Nigeria, 
		Indonesia, East Timor, Mexico, Guatumala, Venuzuela, Ethipoia, Liberia 
		and the democratic Republic of Congo..<br><br>In 1962 Ethiopia annexed 
		Eritrea and for thirty years the Eritreans sought independence in a war 
		causing horrific casualties. Between September 7-19 the Carter Centre 
		hosted preliminary peace negotiations between the Ethiopian government 
		and the Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front. These proved ineffective and 
		the war continued with huge human suffering until both sides agreed to a 
		comprehensive peace agreement in June 2000.<br><br>At the conclusion of 
		World War II hostilities against Japan, Russian forces accepted the 
		surrender of the Japanese in Korea above the 38th degree latitude north 
		and the Americans accepted the surrender of those south of that mark. It 
		proved impossible to unite the country and on 25 June, 1950 hostilities 
		broke out between North and South Koreas lasting until an armistice was 
		signed on 27 July 1953. China had supported North Korea during the 
		hostilities and on 14 June, 1967 exploded its first hydrogen bomb, thus 
		creating an additional threat to world peace. In June, 1994, Carter met 
		with the leaders of North and South Korea to discuss nuclear disarmament 
		and although some success was achieved the death of North Korean leader 
		Kim Il Sung shortly afterwards aborted the plans.<br><br>Following the 
		death of Marshal Tito in 1980, Yugoslavia a nation of eight disparate 
		states which he had held together by his strength of will and political 
		cunning began to disintegrate and a series of civil wars broke out with 
		huge casualties and abuse of human rights. In December 1994 Carter 
		travelled to the Balkans and negotiated a four-month cease-fire and 
		resumption of peace talks between Muslim Bosnia and Catholic Serbia. In 
		1995, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter negotiated a two month cease-fire in 
		Sudan to allow for efforts to eradicate Guinea Worm Disease, prevent 
		River Blindness and immunisation against the polio virus. ..<br><br>A 
		Rotarian, and the author of twenty-two books on human rights, and the 
		peaceful resolution of conflict, his views have been the subject of 
		strong criticism by those whose agenda is the continuation of conflict 
		or status quo.. He has received numerous honours in recognition of his 
		efforts in those fields; He received the Rotary International Award for 
		World Understanding in 1984 and was the first recipient of the United 
		Nations Human Rights Prize in 1998, On10 December, 2002 received the 
		Nobel Prize for Peace. It is said that events in history cannot be put 
		in their proper perspective until fifty years afte the event. When 
		historians analyse the 20th century, James Earl Carter Jnr of Plains, 
		Georgia, USA will occupy a respected place as a humanitarian and a 
		peacemaker.. The last words should be his and they are the conclusion of 
		his address on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize:-<br><br>War may 
		sometimes be a necessary evil. But no matter how necessary, it is always 
		an evil, never a good. We will not learn how to live together in peace 
		by killing each other's children.<br><br>The bond of our common humanity 
		is stronger than the divisiveness of our fears and prejudices. God gives 
		us the capacity for choice. We can choose to alleviate suffering. We can 
		choose to work together for peace. We can make these changes - and we 
		must.</td>
