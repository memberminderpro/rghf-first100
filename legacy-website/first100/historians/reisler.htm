		the Rotary Club of New York’s first female president. The club was about 
		to celebrate its 92nd anniversary, and it made a big production of my 
		installation. A group from the New York Police Department marched me in, 
		singing “New York, New York”; I announced my agenda for the coming year; 
		everybody toasted. And we thought that would be the historic event of 
		the year.<br><br>The morning of 11 September, I was in my Brooklyn 
		apartment getting ready for a club meeting. My daughter called and told 
		me to turn on the television. I watched as the second plane struck, and 
		it dawned on me that I was on an island. My family was not there: My 
		husband was in the suburbs at our home, my children were scattered. I 
		worried that some of the members of my Rotary club were at the World 
		Trade Center – a fear that was later confirmed. I’d never felt so alone.<br>
		<br>Then I turned on my computer. Messages from Rotarians all over the 
		world were pouring in – from Lebanon, England, Israel, France. Club 
		presidents were asking, “How can we help?” I spent days at my computer 
		trying to keep up with the messages from people in different time zones. 
		I hardly slept. The checks began coming in. I called our club’s 
		executive director and asked him to work with the chair of our club’s 
		foundation to open a special account. Then I called an emergency club 
		meeting.<br><br>We had 185 members at the time and were fortunate not to 
		have lost anyone in the attacks. I remember thinking it was important to 
		keep the members feeling safe and hopeful. I worried that those who 
		didn’t live in Manhattan might be afraid to come to the meeting. But 
		everyone showed up. I recalled how, as a child during World War II, I’d 
		participated in air-raid drills at my school. As the children were 
		hiding their heads in their hands, my music teacher had asked me to run 
		down the halls singing “Home on the Range,” just to give them some hope. 
		After 9/11, I felt the same call to inspire the members of my club.<br>
		<br>At every meeting, we played patriotic songs. I invited firefighters 
		and others who’d been injured to attend. I invited people who had lost 
		loved ones: a widow and her child, a father who had lost his son and who 
		continued to attend meetings. I made the club a haven for those who had 
		been affected by the attacks – not only to support them, but to motivate 
		the members of my club.<br><br>I often was up until 3 a.m. coordinating 
		the teams I’d organized. That was one of the most important things I 
		did: make personal contact with members, organize and motivate them, 
		give them hope. I had an Internet team to spread the word. We used the 
		Internet to explain to donors what we were doing with their money and to 
		show them the reality of the situation in New York. Another committee 
		organized members to head to ground zero to volunteer their skills. All 
		of our members have unique skills. One is a forensic dentist who helped 
		identify victims in the days after the attacks; one is an officer in the 
		New York branch of the American Lung Association who tested the air 
		quality at the disaster site; another, who owns a courier service, used 
		his van to bring bottled water to the volunteers. We also had an 
		85-year-old member who helped Salvation Army volunteers serve food.<br>
		<br>Then there was a committee to identify people who needed emergency 
		funds. Some of the committee members weren’t even Rotarians, but they 
		later joined. I made applications to hand out to people who needed 
		assistance. Team members traveled on foot to churches, synagogues, 
		firehouses, and police stations. Everything was personal and well 
		organized. We went to meetings of the Better Business Bureau and various 
		charitable organizations to find out where the need was greatest. We 
		found individuals with touching stories who needed our help. Some had 
		lost their adult children and suddenly found themselves the sole 
		caretakers of their grandchildren. Another man lost his daughter, who 
		had been helping him pay rent and maintain his home.<br><br>When Rotary 
		clubs in Michigan volunteered to assist children who had lost a parent 
		in the attacks, I formed another committee to coordinate that effort. In 
		all, the Michigan clubs adopted eight mothers and their children. For an 
		entire year, the clubs sent the families money for expenses, along with 
		letters of support. The committee also organized a way to give back to 
		the first responders who worked day and night at ground zero in the 
		months after the attack. Volunteers offered firefighters and police 
		officers weekend family getaways at vacation rental homes in Nantucket. 
		We even sent a firefighter and his new wife to New Zealand and another 
		couple to England; the host clubs and districts welcomed the New Yorkers 
		as if they were their own. One firefighter told me he cried when he got 
		the application for his vacation.<br><br>Every year, we honor the 
		firefighters and the police, and every year, I receive a phone call from 
		one of the men and women whom we helped. Last year, I invited John Jonas 
		and his crew to speak at our club. Dubbed the Miracle of Ladder Six, 
		they are a group of firefighters who were inside the World Trade Center 
		on 9/11. The crew recounted how, as they were running down the stairs of 
		the north tower, each carrying 100 pounds of gear, a woman they were 
		helping collapsed from fatigue. Though the building was crumbling around 
		them, they refused to leave her and, as a result, became trapped in the 
		stairwell. Hours later, they were able to escape with the woman. But had 
		they not stayed to help her, they said, the entire crew would have been 
		killed in the collapse. When they finished telling the story, Jonas 
		thanked his men for their bravery. Everyone in the room was clearly 
		moved.<br><br>People often remark how terrible it must have been to be 
		the president of the Rotary Club of New York on 9/11. I say just the 
		opposite. I thank God I was in that position. I’m grateful to have used 
		my skills of coordination and my ability to inspire. One of the greatest 
		compliments I received was when one of the men in my club said, “You 
		know, Helen, we were talking about what you did after 9/11. We looked 
		around and asked, ‘Who, out of all these men, could have handled that?’ 
		No one.” I did it for myself and to open doors for other women. Many 
		women have joined the club since then, many of them young. Somehow, I’ve 
		set myself up as a mentor (that’s what the members of my club call me, 
		anyway). And I love it. I love to inspire them. I love to help them feel 
		proud to be Rotarians.</td>
