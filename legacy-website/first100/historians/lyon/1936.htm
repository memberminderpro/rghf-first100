		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">&nbsp;This portion of Dr. Lyon's 
		book deals with his Rotary experience in 1936.<br><br>
		<img alt="Lyon" class="auto-style26" src="process&#32;mind_lyon.jpg" style="float: left">Grandmother 
		Richards takes over<br><br>In the spring of my freshman year, as our 
		Luisetti team took all the honors, my beloved Grandmother Richards 
		passed quietly away as her kidneys failed, the end point of scarlet 
		fever acquired in the waters of Sutro Baths near the Golden Gate. She 
		had been living with us for sometime. I had many talks with her, for I 
		was becoming a history buff. Her tales about the Old South and the Civil 
		War never tired me. Gram knew I had a dream, quite impossible to 
		achieve, of riding a bicycle through Europe, so far away from home and 
		family. Air travel was then restricted to pioneering Pan American flying 
		boats to Hawaii and South America. The telegraph was the only reliable 
		means of direct communication and not available everywhere. So, dream on 
		Dick, no charge, as you still have the Foreign Service in your 
		prospects.<br><br>Gram’s Will made this dream come true. Ted and I were 
		each to receive $800 that could only be spent riding bicycles in Europe. 
		There was no backing off from this commitment, and there was a time 
		frame dictating &quot;now.&quot; The year was 1936, and the Olympics would be in 
		Berlin.Lyon<br><br>
		Dad 
		and Mom, faced with an obligation that must be met, frightened of 
		course, started to plan. Both of them, always making something odious 
		into something good, decided that the $1,600 could be stretched to take 
		us around the world. Dad would make us into Rotary Ambassadors of 
		Goodwill by enlisting the help of Paul Harris, Founder of Rotary, that 
		was by then in 57 countries, many on our route. His letter assured our 
		parents that their sons would have helping hands when in need, and 
		further, that two American young men, whose teeth were cut on a Rotary 
		Wheel, could strengthen the ties that bind this organization. Dad sent 
		the letter to the clubs in each major city on our route. <br><br>
		We 
		leave our home for eight months to see the world <br><br>
		<img alt="Lyon" class="auto-style26" src="1936_Page_13153.jpg" style="float: left">The hours 
		riding in the bus to Seattle were the only ones on the trip that were 
		troubled by any apprehension. The enormity of our undertaking was 
		becoming obvious. By the time we boarded the NYK Hiya Maru, our 
		confidence had reestablished itself and our days would be dedicated to 
		planning ahead.<br><br>The trip in winter in the subarctic seas was a 
		rough one, our sturdy ship and equally sturdy captain plunging along. 
		The ten passengers made common sense of using first class comforts, 
		returning to second class for meals, there chasing plates as they 
		careened, some to the deck. No one was seasick. There was really no time 
		to sit in a deck chair with nothing to do except respond to the 
		environment.<br><br>
		Japan<br>
		<br>Our Rotary involvement began the day we landed in Yokohama. We were 
		met and were squired for three weeks in Japan from Tokyo to Kobe. We 
		spoke to Tokyo Rotary, had meals and nights in Japanese homes, and 
		accompanied young folk to Nikko in the awesome beauty of winter 
		snow-decked Japanese temples. We were taken to Hakone and Miyanoshita in 
		the shadow of Mount Fujiama, stayed at the fabled Tawaraya Riokan 
		(native hotel) in Kyoto, spent the night with the monks on Mount Koya 
		San, and watched the Takarazuka dancers in 
		<img class="auto-style26" src="1936_Page_2.jpg" style="float: left">Kobe, their performance far 
		surpassing anything we had seen at home. In the hands of Rotarians we 
		believed we were seeing the Japanese world of the future. They were the 
		highly educated, often even royalty, as were Baron and Baroness Togo, 
		dedicated to catching up with the outside world first discovered in the 
		1880s as the Emperor Mejii accepted Admiral Perry’s challenge. These 
		days would have a profound effect on my thinking when Japan would become 
		the enemy just a few years later. At Stanford, as we prepared for this 
		great adventure, I had taken a course in Japanese history and absorbed 
		it to a degree that my appreciation of its culture made Japan for me 
		much more than just beautiful mountains and seas. This tendency to 
		always look forward and prepare for what might occur would be a staple 
		for my life.<br><br>
		China
		<br><br>The Suwa Maru picked us up at Osaka and steamed towards 
		Shanghai, where Rotary again took over. Fong Sec, the father of Rotary 
		in China and Dad’s friend, treated us to the most sumptuous meal we 
		would ever have. It was course after course of traditional and historic 
		delicacies that I doubt can be obtained today. We saw the real China in 
		the narrow alleys behind the burgeoning western world of the Bund. 
		Rotary there was in its infancy, lagging behind Japan.<br><br>Back on 
		the Suwa Maru, steaming to Hong Kong, Charlie Chaplin, his beautiful 
		companion Hedy Lamarr, and her chaperoning mother, made for a few hours 
		of talk. Charlie Chaplin proved to be an incisive thinker, belying his 
		character on the silver screen. <br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="1936_Page_23158.jpg" style="float: left">Rotary in Hong Kong was a 
		surprise. It still operated in the colonial tradition. There were no 
		Chinese members. We watched our words carefully. A side trip to Canton, 
		with its Ling Nan University and American friends there, took us into 
		the heart of old China. The individuality of the Cantonese left an 
		indelible impression that Canton was in an almost medieval state, more 
		like America in its earliest entrepreneurial days. China was far from 
		being cast in a single mold.<br><br>
		Philippines<br>
		<br>On our side trip to Manila, we were in the hands of family friends, 
		the Judge Lockwoods. They made sure we tasted of the always colorful 
		flavors of brightly painted taxis and rickshaws provided by a people 
		seemingly content with the primitive joys that were soon to change. 
		Rotary was not our host at this stop, and this again was the old 
		colonial world. There were cool mountain retreats for the rich and 
		privileged. We, the latter, played a round of golf in Baguio before 
		going on board ship again, back to Hong Hong to board our liner back to 
		the west.<br><br>
		Singapore, 
		Ceylon, Aden, Suez<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="1936_Page_3.jpg" style="float: left">In Singapore, the Rotary President met us to 
		be sure our few hours ashore were well spent. The harbor was a mass of 
		activity, which included boys diving for coins beside the ship. Our 
		colonial world again took over as we had cold drinks and lunch at the 
		fabled Raffles Hotel. The city seemed as beautiful and disciplined as I 
		understand it is today. What do I remember most vividly? It was the tall 
		handsome Sikhs in magnificent tunics, hand directing traffic with a 
		flick of a finger, perhaps an arm wave at most, always unflappable.<br>
		<br>It was a short sail to Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. Rotary President 
		Reverend Dr. Nathanialez, met the ship and treated us to classic 
		tropical fare as we talked with his seven children, all with college 
		scholarships waiting for them in England. We’ll never forget the hot 
		curry and the cold fruit drinks that spoiled us forever. Curry today is 
		not even a shadow of what it was then. As we embarked, the Reverend 
		presented to each of us a tiny ebony elephant. It rests in front of me 
		today as I remember and write.<br><br>
		The 
		rest of the sail took us through the Gulf of Aden and the Suez Canal. In 
		Port Said we had the opportunity to make a one-day side trip to Egypt. 
		Ted and I both felt that such a short visit was unconscionable for a 
		site so historic. We would take our chances that some day in the future 
		we would give Egypt the respect due it. And of course there was the 
		added matter of cost. Our dollars were too precious not to hoard them 
		for the biking days ahead<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="1936_Page_33162.jpg" style="float: left">Marseilles<br><br>The Mediterranean’s 
		blue surrounded us the next days as we passed the smoking Stromboli 
		volcano, then made land on Easter morning, docking sounds muted by the 
		music of church bells heralding the day. It was Sunday, and another 
		holiday would follow. All of our only dollars were in my money belt, as 
		a Letter of Credit that could not be invaded until banks would open. Mr. 
		Shallam, old &quot;China Hand&quot; returning for a well-deserved vacation in 
		England, took his Masonry <br><br>French Riviera first<br><br>
		Our 
		first days biking over the hills to Toulon started to toughen us up. At 
		Le Lavendou, a tiny medieval hamlet on the Mediterranean, we had our 
		first taste of rain. In our beach-side pension, after delicious meals, 
		it was a treat to sit and read while looking out on the turbulent sea. 
		The ride then took us through even older Hyères to Cannes and Nice. Did 
		we stare at the scantily clad beauties on the beaches? I don’t think so. 
		We were still too busy being absorbed into our own world of make 
		believe.<br><br>We watched the Rolls Royce's roll up to the Monte Carlo 
		Casino. Somehow we talked the concierge into letting us do our ogling at 
		the tables, hands firmly in our pockets as we planned for the intensive 
		ride the next day. It would be east on the Moyenne (Middle) Cornice, and 
		then back on the high altitude Grande Cornice with its tiny historic 
		castle at Eze. We were beginning to really roll. <br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="1936_Page_33165.jpg" style="float: left">The 
		next day was Saturday, and we would cycle into Italy. The border is a 
		thousand feet above the city of Menton. There we had our first 
		experience with a border crossing, not shared by bus loads of tourists 
		flashing by. More lira? For a deposit on our bikes? It’s Saturday and 
		the banks are closed!<br><br>Ted stayed at the station while I rode down 
		into Menton. I somehow located the Black Market, took a beating in the 
		exchange, and pedaled back up. These two now bedraggled American boys in 
		shorts and T-shirts could pedal into Italy, keeping out of the way of 
		the roaring busses.<br><br>It’s Italy <br><br>Our first taste of Italy 
		on this weekend was of red and yellow flowers and a small square filled 
		with old and young, loafing and dancing as joy seemed to fill the air. 
		This was a welcome change from the sophisticated coolness of the French 
		Riviera. It predicted wonderful days ahead, especially when we were able 
		for $10 apiece to procure railroad seats taking us anywhere and 
		everywhere in Italy. Mussolini was rightly famed for his railroads, 
		always on time, with baths (doccia) available at every main station. A 
		hot shower, soap and towels were provided. Could we ask for anything 
		more?<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="1936_Page_4.jpg" style="float: left">With 
		bikes in the baggage car everywhere we went, taken out and ridden for 
		miles through historic sites and wholesome countrysides, we kept our 
		legs in reasonable shape. However, our strength was no match for that of 
		the locals. Once we hit the cobblestones that ringed every city and 
		provided main streets in the hamlets, there would be friendly 
		competition as youths came up from behind, challenged us, went by, and 
		then rode away to their homes, always laughing and waving.<br><br>We 
		were in the catacombs outside Rome when the Harrison Flannerys, scions 
		of an old well-to-do family in Pittsburgh, asked us if we would like to 
		go with them to Naples and Pompeii in their new Ford convertible sedan. 
		You can’t beat that, and those were fun days. They stayed at the finest 
		hotels while we wandered through the byways, searching for a reasonable 
		and comfortable pension. They had their Baedeker to guide them, but we 
		had something better. It was called the Hand Me Down, made available by 
		Holland America Line. It was a paperback with recommendations for 
		hotels, restaurants with their prices and also special things to see, 
		all gathered from travelers over the many years. It was our Bible and 
		never let us down. So, our searches were always short and the results 
		superb.<br><br>
		Beyond 
		the routine visits to Herculaneum and Pompeii, our climb to the summit 
		of a smoking and burning Vesuvius was truly “tops.” I can still remember 
		the guide beseeching us to not go any further, but we did until the hot 
		soles of our shoes said &quot;nuff.&quot; I am guessing our visit to the active 
		volcano may have been among the last, as Vesuvius sleeps these days.<br>
		<br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="1936_Page_43169.jpg" style="float: left">Il Duce appears and so do we <br><br>We returned to Rome to find the 
		excitement intense, for Il Duce was to speak from his palace in Piazza 
		Venezia. The war in Ethiopia had ended with Italy the victor and now, 
		with a major African colony, the Roman Empire was reborn. All of the 
		avenues entering the Piazza were packed; there were a million people in 
		front of the candlelit Vittorio Emanuele II Monument.<br><br>Ted and I, 
		head and shoulders above most of the crowd, sort of slithered and slid 
		forward until we were just a few of feet away from Mussolini standing 
		above on the portico. Il Duce was the chant, even as he spoke, his hand 
		always out in salute while Il Duce small papers were scattered by planes 
		close above. <br><br>
		Once 
		he disappeared behind the drapes, many near us seemed to be going 
		somewhere else. We followed to find ourselves in a jubilant parade, 
		ending up at the Quirinale, the King’s Palace, on top of one Rome's 
		seven hills. There was the king himself, Victor Emanuel, saluting the 
		crowd. We returned to our Pensione Juliana, two very tired boys.<br><br>
		What do I remember most about Rome of 1936? The fountains and plazas 
		lined with colorful sidewalk cafes; the stillness and peace as we 
		picnicked in the grass and wildflowers lining the large cobblestones of 
		the Appian 
		<img class="auto-style26" src="1936_Page_43352.jpg" style="float: left">Way; the inner, fearful grandeur of the Coliseum as we 
		conjured up gladiators coming through the tunnels to fight to their 
		deaths. That dream was breached when we overstayed, finding ourselves 
		locked in. Much yelling brought the Carabinieri, who laughed at our 
		confinement and didn’t take us to jail for breaking the law. Bikes took 
		us to Hadrian’s Villa, its trees filled with the songs of birds, and the 
		Villa d'Este in Tivoli, magnificent in the night, as Mussolini prized 
		its lighted pools and falls. We threw our coins in the fountain of Trevi 
		as we left to go north, first to Assisi, and then to Florence, Venice, 
		and Milan, finally leaving the train well into the Alps at Iselle.<br>
		<br>This 
		hamlet was really tiny-just an equally tiny hotel over a rushing stream 
		and a train station. True to what we had been promised as we left our 
		bikes at the station in Florence, there they were, and ready to go 
		again. Thanks Benito.<br><br>We ride over the Simplon Pass–the first 
		that year.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="1936_Page_5.jpg" style="float: left">Purely by chance and good luck we went through customs 
		as the first to go over the Simplon Pass that year. Again, we were at 
		the mercy of the agent, a swarthy unshaven character out of a Hollywood 
		western who played his part well as he smilingly cheated us as we 
		exchanged lira for francs. No matter, we were thrilled to be on our way 
		through snow tunnels, alternately walking and riding towards the 6,500 
		foot summit. We miscalculated the availability of food. Our usual habit 
		of buying some vegetables and bread along the way was impossible, for 
		habitations were far away on the mountain slopes where cattle grazed, 
		their tinkling bells music to our ears.<br><br>
		It 
		was the Benedictine Hospice that will forever be engraved on our 
		memories. The Saint Bernards met us. The priest took us in, fed us, and 
		sent us on our way. This was a fairy tale made real. A few coins at the 
		altar hardly covered the joy of that day.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="1936_Page_54211.jpg" style="float: left">We were sure we were 
		finally in Switzerland. There would be no more haggling over each 
		purchase, and blue-eyed, fair-haired country folk would be our hosts. 
		And the next ride would be downhill all of the way to Brig, four 
		thousand feet below. Riding at times with our feet on the bars despite 
		the gravel surface, our joy was brought to a halt as my rear tire went 
		flat. The pastures around were empty and silent, until, from nowhere, 
		our first Swiss friend appeared. Mountain dialects didn’t allow any 
		explanation. None were needed. He took out his kit, removed the tire, 
		patched it, and blew it up again, all in one motion, ending as he took 
		off with a smile and a wave. What a welcome to the land we had dreamed 
		of for so long! And, its mighty Matterhorn was just ahead.<br><br>
		To 
		see it meant a long walk, pushing bikes, on a narrow well-worn mountain 
		path. Cars were not allowed in Zermatt. We went through tiny St. 
		Nicholas, and along the meandering stream, wildflowers abounding. 
		Zermatt was just as anticipated, a fairy land. We gave no thought to 
		making a climb to the Matterhorn’s summit, for that would take days of 
		getting used to the altitude, so the magnificent mountain was just that 
		from afar. We had to be on our way again.<br><br>Then came the rain <br>
		<br>
		The 
		Rhone River Valley was an easy coast downhill, we thought, until the 
		winds from Lake Geneva, sweeping so powerfully up the valley, made us 
		push in low gear for hours to make any headway. Rotary came to the 
		rescue in Geneva, placing us in our first hostel. There we learned the 
		virtues of &quot;café au lait,&quot; along with beer, to be a constant source of 
		energy for the rest of our journey.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="1936_Page_54549.jpg" style="float: left">Then the rains began. It was 
		only mid June. It poured and poured and poured! After four days of 
		waiting for respite, we purchased sorry raincoats––no parkas then––and 
		went on the road. The water went in at the collar and out over the 
		shoes. We had to keep riding to stay warm, not hard to do going uphill, 
		but a downhill run would chill us to the bone. After one such chill, I 
		spent the night in Ted’s arms, our blankets not effective. I must have 
		been in good shape to have tolerated this. <br><br>
		We 
		rode on through picturesque old Bern to Interlaken, still in the rain 
		and denying us the awe-inspiring views we had expected and believed we 
		deserved. In Interlaken the Rotary president, architect Niggli, put us 
		in comfy, warm beds. One day of sunshine let us climb up the valley and 
		the three thousand feet to Mürren (no money for the lift) to see the 
		Jungfrau in all of its grandeur. It, along with Zermatt’s Matterhorn, 
		had to suffice for Switzerland’s physical beauty. The beauty of its 
		people did the rest.<br><br>Our first real country hostel outside of 
		Lucerne gave us a taste of what was to follow. It was full, as was often 
		the case, for most travelers were on the road for a day or two and would 
		stop early. We would ride full days, up to 100 miles if pavements 
		allowed, so we often would check in late and accommodations were likely 
		to be makeshift. This night Ted and I slept on mats in the attic, but 
		the view through the bottle glass windows was compensation enough. <br>
		<br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="1936_Page_6.jpg" style="float: left">Swiss 
		roads were a joy, and bicycle paths were appearing. However, often we 
		would leave the highway, and push and ride up a side road to gain the 
		full flavor of the land and its people. It was on to Lucern, where our 
		main destination was the main park and its famous Lion of Lucerne. He 
		didn’t let us down. Then we were on to Zurich and our next Rotary 
		experience.<br><br>Zurich Rotary, to be followed by Munich Rotary, came 
		the closest to our American concept of a Club. Herr Turler, maker of 
		world recognized watches and Herr Sprungli, a world chocolate king, made 
		us feel at home at the meeting. Sprungli chocolates filled our packs 
		when we left. At dinner in Zurich’s finest restaurant we can never 
		forget the spit-barbecued lamb, again a Rotary gift. <br><br>The road to 
		Konstanz in Germany borders the Rhein. Its tiny town, Stein Am Rhein, 
		was and still is a gem not to be missed. Boy Scouts paraded as we came 
		by.<br><br>Our border crossing was easy for the first time. They 
		welcomed blond, blue-eyed Aryans, for they were expecting America to 
		join them in their misguided racial ventures, something we knew nothing 
		of at the time. Then our roadways changed, as paved bicycle paths became 
		common in the more traveled areas<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/images/1936_Page_64956.jpg" style="float: left">On 
		the bicycle paths and roads of Germany <br><br>Munich Rotary was down to 
		just 26 members from over 200 and glad to survive. As an international 
		organization, only it and the Red Cross were allowed. Rotary’s survival 
		was special in that Herr Oberhummer, proprietor of Munich’s largest 
		department store, was one of the original eight members providing 
		Hitler’s original support in Munich. I have wondered if his heart was 
		broken in the years that followed. In his store he made sure we 
		purchased the correct apparel for young men–––Bavarian plumed hat, 
		hosentrager (suspenders) and lederhosen (sturdy leather shorts), and 
		only in fashion when well worn. Muncheners rubbed butter into the 
		leather to make it look well used. We chose otherwise, because Bavarian 
		manners might be unacceptable in the other parts of Europe we would 
		traverse. Germany’s Rotary, bleeding, was to die slowly.<br><br>Riding from Augsburg to Nuremburg, we stopped at 
		Erlangen at its Siemens plant. Its Rotarian manager, Dr. d’Ernst, showed 
		us &quot;die werkes.&quot; Then on to the historic quaint old towns–––Rothenburg, 
		Dinkelsbuhl, Heidelberg, and at the Rhine, Hitler’s showcase hostel, 
		Stahleck Castle. Then it was cobblestones again along the Rhine to Bonn, 
		and a smooth highway to Koln where Hitler’s &quot;Jugend,&quot; (German youths, 
		boys and girls) were toughening up for what was to be their fate. <br>
		<br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/images/1936_Page_64959.jpg" style="float: left" height="200" width="252">This was a serious affair. In contrast to Mussolini’s Young 
		Fascisti, with their small and inconspicuous knives made of rubber, 
		large German Jugend knives in holsters seemed to mean business. We did 
		not warm up to our hostel neighbors. We were just glad to have a bed on 
		which to place our &quot;schlafsacks&quot; (envelope-like sheets), and to be 
		supplied with a blanket and a 10-pfennig breakfast of brot and milch 
		each day. We did not tap into Rotary again as we remained vigorous and 
		healthy, though tired, and felt the need to try and catch up with our 
		schedule that had been ruptured by the rains.<br><br>Holland <br><br>Our 
		introduction to Holland was five days in the home of a family whose 
		“company town” spinning mill was something Ted and I had known only in 
		books. They seemed a happy lot. We slept in really soft beds. Our meals 
		we’ll always remember: breakfast meant eggs anyway we wished them, with 
		a variety of Dutch breads hard to imagine.<br><br>A word about the 
		designation &quot;Dutch.&quot; We quickly learned not to say &quot;Dutch.&quot; It was too 
		close to the German “Deutsch.” “Hollander” it would be from then on.<br>
		<br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/images/1936_Page_7.jpg" style="float: left">Biking in Holland was a breeze. Hostels were all run privately and 
		with the feeling of a home. The highest hill was only three hundred 
		feet. Bicycle paths went everywhere, although we preferred to ride on 
		the dikes. We visited Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and then the southern island 
		of Walcheren, where the ferry deposited us in Belgium. The crossing went 
		almost unnoticed, so relaxed were the officials. The ride down the 
		poplar-lined canal to ancient Brugge was a high point for us, but rain 
		met us again on the road to Brussels. It was time to hurry on toward 
		Paris. We were running out of time as we anticipated the fall semester 
		at Stanford for both of us.<br><br>Paris <br><br>Paris was a turning 
		point. Monsieur Beranger, head of Standard Oil and a friend of a friend, 
		took us in. He gave us his guest room nine stories above his opulent 
		apartment on historic Rue de Lille. We breakfasted with him each day. We 
		were again, as in Holland, temporarily spoiled. He also made 
		preparations for me to fulfill my desire, at that moment, for a foreign 
		service career by enrolling me in the Ecole of Political and Social 
		Science, supposedly the finest preparatory school in the world. I could 
		enter it later on. Rotary again took us in, so to speak, assigning 
		Monsieur Franck to aid us. He spent a good deal of his time complaining 
		that his Coca Cola franchise was not paying off; the French loved their 
		wine. I hope he survived the war, as GI’s and their Cokes invaded.<br>
		<br>Dick gets the black flu in Paris and we race to England<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/images/1936_Page_74964.jpg" style="float: left">Our 
		Paris visit ended when I started to run a high fever accompanied by 
		nausea. This was new, and we had no desire to be sick under French care. 
		We quickly sold our bikes for $5 apiece. I now think we should have 
		brought them home. We boarded the train to Calais, and then the ferry to 
		Dover, and finally the train to London where the London physician 
		Rotarian placed us in the Russell Square Hotel and made daily visits. By 
		that time Ted was feeling &quot;not so good,&quot; but fortunately good enough to 
		stay by my bedside as I became delirious. What is a delirium to me? It 
		is when brother Ted was &quot;there,&quot; for I could see him, but he wasn’t 
		really there. I doubt this will pass the test as an understandable 
		symptom of the &quot;Black Flu&quot; that was then starting a murderous toll on 
		the Continent. I guess we brought it to England. <br><br>There was one 
		major compensation. It was Henry Hyams, certified London Cockney, who by 
		definition had been born and lived within the range of Bow Bells Church. 
		Henry attached himself to us on the Dover ferry and never really left 
		our sides. He brought us food every day, and then introduced us to 
		Petticoat Lane. He taught us many of the cockney &quot;rhyming&quot; expressions 
		such as &quot;A Raspberry Tart,&quot; equivalent to our &quot;The Bird.&quot;<br><br>Forty 
		years later Henry would come to California, determined to see Indians. 
		The best we could do, despite driving him and his wife, Mona, the length 
		of the state, was to send him back to London as a cowboy, all five foot 
		two of him with hat, chaps, and boots, as he said, &quot;Hi pardner,&quot; passing 
		unchallenged through customs<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/images/1936_Page_74968.jpg" style="float: left">We ship for home, at last<br><br>Our 
		three weeks of illness ended up in a luxurious country club with its 
		Rotary members. With returned appetites and wonderful meals and rest for 
		several days, enough time was left to see Windsor Castle and 
		Stratford-Upon-Avon, the wonders of Hyde Park, and the Tower of London, 
		before shipping out on the Cunard steamship Berengaria for home. Our 
		status was just above &quot;steerage,&quot; but as was our experience during the 
		whole trip, we were with the folks who really made the world turn. <br>
		<br>When New York loomed on the horizon, at the bow Ted and I were in 
		tears. We reminisced, and agreed that coming home to America, its 
		people, its freedoms, and its optimism was a gift unknown anywhere else. 
		But there is a price, for as we spread our largess, we cannot expect to 
		be loved or even liked by those who are the receivers. Therefore, in 
		order to be concerned for others and generous, we must above all be 
		powerful and never feel guilty because of it.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/images/1936_Page_8.jpg" style="float: left" height="250" width="167">Knowing how our dad 
		operates, we expected him to be on the dock to greet us and take us 
		home. In that day, Dad would have had to make the five-day train trip to 
		New York. We looked at the crowds below, and no Dad. Oh hum, what’s new? 
		We’d make do and somehow find our way home with the few dollars left. 
		Bulky suitcases in hand, we went down the gangplank and started for the 
		street. As we passed the welcomers at First Class, there was Dad. He 
		always expected the best for his sons. In a few minutes we were gorging 
		on milkshakes at Walgreen's Drugs. <br><br>Dad purchased a used Buick, 
		one of the most powerful ever built, and we roared home. There we put 
		pounds on fast, and recovered the strength that would enable Ted to be a 
		freshman basketball star, and cushion my fanny to sit comfortably on the 
		bench. I had lost the opportunity to stay on the first string while we 
		were learning about the rest of the world. Regrets? Not a bit. As I look 
		back today, I have the same admonitions we expressed on the bow of the 
		Cunard liner Berengaria for the young who must carry on. </td>
