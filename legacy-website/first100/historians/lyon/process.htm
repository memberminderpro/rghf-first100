		<img alt="Lyon" class="auto-style26" src="process&#32;mind_lyon.jpg" style="float: left">I 
		am approaching the midline of the tenth decade of a charmed life, if 
		judged by the quality of lives seen in most of the world. In America 
		that is not the case, for freedom and opportunity exists to such a 
		degree that charmed lives are common. Most &quot;best sellers&quot; depict the 
		highly successful, as measured in power or wealth, and a traumatic 
		childhood. I, on the other hand, like so many others, had all of the 
		advantages of a concerned, loving, disciplined home in an upper middle 
		class world. Despite these advantages, I still became successful, but my 
		concept of success had nothing to do with power or wealth. It did 
		require a comfortable living. But above all, it demanded that, whenever 
		possible, I &quot;give something back.&quot;<br><br>The story I try to tell is 
		studded with &quot;give backs,&quot; a natural result of a mind set about which 
		little has been written. I didn’t recognize what this mind set was until 
		well into my retirement eighties, when my days and nights provided ample 
		time for a life’s review. One of my &quot;give backs&quot; was diminishing the 
		chance of a fatal pulmonary embolism with surgery or travel. Another was 
		making the weighing of patients routine to prevent fluid balance 
		mistakes, often fatal. A third introduced the catheter to keep 
		congenitally incontinent children dry and thus active, social 
		participants. A fourth altered kidney surgery to make it quicker and 
		less painful. Free time allowed my still fully active mind to keep 
		asking new questions. My one talk after War..at Oakland. Dad would have 
		me speaking to all the clubs and I said &quot;no.&quot; <br><br>
		<img alt="My one talk after War..at Oakland. Dad would have me speaking to all the clubs and I said &quot;no.&quot; " class="auto-style26" src="clip_image001_small1.jpg" style="float: left">(Photo 
		left - My one talk after War..at Oakland. Dad would have me speaking to 
		all the clubs and I said &quot;no.&quot;)<br><br>And finally, there is the hope 
		that I have told of real life experiences, many humorous, but revealing 
		enough to let those not physicians in on our professional secrets. What 
		a wonderful trip this has been, as the memories preserved by my Process 
		Mind surface to be lived again and again, a practice that resulted from 
		my forays into areas that others had not tread. What did I see or just 
		stumble on, as I took a moment to notice what made me stumble? In so 
		doing, perhaps a hidden truth had surfaced? Then an answer appeared.<br>
		<br><img class="auto-style26" src="DSCN0199.JPG" style="float: left">It 
		dawned on me that my inability to marshal a Quick Memory was in reality 
		a great blessing. I had considered this a deficit as I watched the 
		“straight A” students easily be accepted in whatever specialty they 
		chose to follow. My being admitted to medical school had required other 
		qualities than just getting top grades. Today, where sheer numbers 
		demand that machines replace human judgments, the personal element is 
		often lost. The paradox is that the Process Mind is needed everywhere 
		and more than ever. This type of mind has a peculiar need for mentors, 
		for its never-ending questions must be answered. I hope I can encourage 
		such minds to persevere. Thus I relate my own Process Mind story as one 
		of doing something every day for someone while fulfilling the commitment 
		to home and family.<br><br>My Process Mind works like this. I must 
		understand to remember. This takes more time than is required for the 
		Quick Memory minds. However, it is the remembering that makes the 
		difference, allowing me to tell this story today in the hope I will be 
		effective.<br><br>
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/lyon_ad.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="166" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/lyon_ad.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>I 
		have come to believe that enthusiasm, call it a passion, is a catalyst, 
		unquenchable and indestructible, at times allowing one to accomplish 
		what seems impossible. The Process Mind is ideally suited for this 
		endeavor, for it demands basic truths to be stored and recalled. 
		Possibilities of new concepts and new uses fan out, requiring only solid 
		judgment as to their value and their doable potentials.<br><br>Whom do I 
		hope will read this story? First will be high school students wondering 
		what is ahead, and how their journeys may be influenced by an 
		understanding as to how they learn and remember. Recognition of the 
		Process Mind and its characteristics can make all the difference, as 
		curiosities abound and mentors are sought and recognized. I would wish 
		to be one of them.<br><br>Their parents are next in line, especially the 
		new ones, searching for guidance as they direct young lives flowering 
		before them. It is critical that the &quot;slower to remember&quot; Process Minds 
		be recognized and stimulated early on.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/Van%201920%201.jpg" style="float: left">I 
		hope medical educators will read here about how one of their own has 
		used his Process Mind to contribute solidly, and will recognize the 
		creative potentials lying in such minds as they not only leave 
		something, but stimulate fellow students to awaken their own processing 
		potentials. Surely, to have both a Quick Memory and a Process Memory 
		acting in concert is a gift with immense potential. It is likely to be 
		the process component that is the driver. At home and in the classroom, 
		a start at uncovering and stimulating the thinking potential of a child, 
		whether naturally a Quick Memorizer or Process Thinker, would be to 
		counter questionable statements with &quot;Please explain.&quot; This would seem 
		to be well within the reach of the concerned parent. Would the modern 
		schoolroom make time for this exploration? Surgeons like myself can 
		relive experiences, perhaps even more poignant than my own, as I expose 
		the workings of our medical minds under trying circumstances.<br><br>

		physicians as a group should, with a little time on their hands, chuckle 
		at events I have described, perhaps unearthing their experiences not 
		thought of for a long time and to be relished in the retelling and 
		hearing. And car lovers should share with me the joys of driving their 
		“Blue Beauties” and vicariously racing on a Bondurant Speedway.<br><br>
		Historians must not be left out, for much that is documented here will 
		reveal the characteristics of the part of America I represent, as it 
		chronicles one family’s trials and joys in a privileged century of 
		freedom, at times contested, but which in the end is a monument to the 
		America envisioned by founding fathers almost 250 years ago. <br><br>
		CHAPTER 1<br><br>THE BEGINNING<br><br>I was born <br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="DSC_0095_3.JPG" style="float: left">I’ve 
		been reading another success story. It is so wholesome that I wonder if 
		I would be reading it if the subject were not already a famous person. 
		Be that as it may, I will assume that someday, probably long after I am 
		gone, I could be a famous memory. So why don’t I tell my version as to 
		how I got there while I can still be put on the spot with questions? 
		First, let me make it clear that I was not raised in poverty, was not 
		mistreated, and have never thrown a punch in anger or as a defense. I 
		had what many could call an ''idyllic childhood&quot; and yet I made good, if 
		personal satisfaction with how I have used my days is to be the judge.<br>
		<br>I was born at home in Oakland. Albert Meads, to become &quot;Uncle Bert,&quot; 
		delivered me at 125 Grand Avenue in a day when hospital deliveries had 
		become almost the rule. He had been a family doctor for some years. 
		Then, as specialties began to appear, he went to the Midwest to train as 
		a urologist with one of the icons of that time. He returned, accredited 
		by this minimal specialty experience, yet his family practice habits 
		stayed with him until the day he died. He loved people. Bringing them 
		into the world was his apex of achievement. <br><br>I come into our 
		world at the end of World War I <br><br>As a tiny tot on Grand 
		Avenue I had no understanding that Dad was at death’s door. The 1918 flu 
		epidemic had taken him down as he worked in the Military Reserve. Uncle 
		Bert believed he had no chance to survive. The mortality was soaring 
		throughout America, taking far more American lives at home than did the 
		war itself. Dad somehow made it. Our family lives could again take off. 
		There was a family tenacity already manifest. This seems to have 
		trickled into the next generation, for I too was tried by whooping cough 
		(Pertussis) a few years later, in the days before immunization became 
		the rule. By then we had moved to Highland Avenue in Piedmont. I suppose 
		this was a step up on the social ladder. <br><br>Dad 
		did not mind the added distance to work. On the cushy seat of his Pierce 
		Arrow, he was never happier than when behind its wheel. This also turned 
		out to be a family characteristic as I inherited this joy, later pushing 
		it to extremes when I passed the Bondurant High Performance Driving test 
		60 years later. That story can wait.<br><br>Dad’s work–call it joy<br><br>Lyon Storage and Moving Co. was the first of its kind west of 
		the Rockies. Most of Dad’s vans were horse drawn. He would be on his way 
		at five o'clock each morning in order to supervise the harnessing and 
		make sure that hooves were healthy. Petro Pine ointment, a balsamic 
		salve, was his wonder drug. It went on every sore or abrasion. Its 
		quality of &quot;clinging&quot; made it work. Where did this come from? Some 
		entrepreneur had stored crates of it, and then disappeared, not to 
		return. Dad, always the opportunist, on this occasion got his full 
		money’s worth. <br><br>Dad thought he was a good judge of horses, 
		until he purchased one that turned out to be blind. A Lyon 
		characteristic again appeared as he made the best of a bad bargain. The 
		blind one became the center horse and the leader in the brace of three. 
		His power surpassed his fellows as he pulled the others with him.<br>
		<br>Then, in our first Piedmont year, a motored van was acquired. It was 
		a flatbed with a top speed of 12 miles an hour. It could deliver loads 
		on Piedmont’s streets, so steep that horses feared to tread. Next came 
		the enclosed van, a bit faster. It rang the death knell for horsepower 
		not enclosed in steel. And finally, Dad acquired the tractor-trailer to 
		end up as an 18-wheeler.<br><br>Though Dad loved his horses, it was the 
		horsepower driving the pistons in his Pierce Arrows that thrilled him. 
		He told me that he had owned 17 Pierce Arrows in a row. When the models 
		came out in the twenties, still with cloth tops and celluloid side 
		curtains, he started to acquire these seven-passenger behemoths from 
		Piedmonter Eamon of “Eamon Olives.” He had paid $5,000 for each car with 
		its lifetime warranty. After only one year, the Pierce was barely broken 
		in. Soon Dad had a local company, Gillig, now a nationally known bus 
		company, put on the first closed top. It was of patent leather and with 
		sliding windows. These cars, with the life-sized lion from the office 
		window on the hood, led many a downtown parade, Dad at the wheel. What a 
		&quot;dandy&quot; he must been! And when another year went by, the Pierce would 
		end up in Yosemite Valley as a tour bus with many years yet to go. 
		Sadly, the lifetime warranty did the company in. Studebaker bought it 
		and allowed a slow demise, hastened by WW II, when its unique aluminum 
		engine blocks were melted for arms. Finding Dad’s car in a show today is 
		unlikely. My love of cars can’t be hereditary. It was acquired, like so 
		many wondrous things we are given by our parents.<br><br>I become “my 
		brother’s keeper”<br><br>
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/Laurie996.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="170" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/Laurie996.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>There 
		was a strict rule in our house directed at me, age 5, and Ted, age 4. 
		Our scooter must never leave the upper driveway, for its course of some 
		60 feet to the street below was steep. Ted broke the rule. I called out, 
		&quot;Bruder gone down the driveway.&quot; Who was punished? Not Ted, but Dick. I 
		had been informed that I was &quot;my brother’s keeper.&quot; This rule is 
		embedded deep within me. I would repeatedly find that it would extend 
		well beyond such a narrow family designation in life ahead.<br><br>So 
		what was my trial at age five? The whooping cough, Pertussis, hit with a 
		vengeance. I remember long days in the dark in my upstairs room on 
		Highland with shades pulled as I hacked away and scared even my doctor. 
		The decision? We must move to a warmer, drier climate. The change in our 
		lifestyle made no difference as another Lyon characteristic surfaced. 
		The decision was prompt and action just as prompt. Mom and Dad sold the 
		house and we moved, lock, stock and barrel, to Sunol, some 50 miles 
		away. A family characteristic was becoming firmly embedded in this son. 
		Just assemble the facts, decide, and &quot;Do It Now.&quot; I had been given the 
		blessing of being able to almost unconsciously daily assemble facts, 
		shunting aside emotions, and thus being prepared to make the required 
		decision without a moment’s hesitation. Was preparing as an engineer, 
		then a doctor, an early subconscious decision?<br><br>We move to the 
		country to help me live<br><br>Sunol was a child’s heaven. We slept in a 
		massive, screened outside porch. Each day we had miles of free walking 
		space through fruit trees and berry bushes bursting with goodies asking 
		to be picked. I can’t say it was that easy for Mom, because the cooking 
		was entirely in her hands. I guess I should have felt sorry for Dad and 
		his long commute each day on narrow winding roads through hamlets that 
		now are extended cities. But by then, even in my tender years, I knew 
		Dad was in seventh heaven behind the wheel of his Pierce. He always had 
		a tow line available to give someone out of gas or in a ditch a helping 
		hand. I am sure those driving hours were his time to think and plan, his 
		eyes never leaving the road and he alert to every nuance.<br><br>
		Apparently I recovered my strength after six months in Sunol. Dad found 
		a cottage in an abandoned nursery just one mile from the tiny hamlet of 
		Danville. It was closer to Oakland, and the highways were easier to 
		navigate. We promptly moved in. Of course, moving was duck soup. Lyon 
		was the mover. Mom was now in a cramped kitchen as she made the most of 
		natural food sources all around. Dad would usually drive the Pierce to 
		Saranap––yes that was its name––a station on the fringes of what would 
		soon be Lafayette. Then he would take the comfortable Sacramento Short 
		Line electric train through the long tunnel in the Berkeley Hills, 
		landing him close to his office in the just completed Lyon warehouse, 
		its clock tower a landmark. It seems like a toy as the Warren Freeway 
		brushes it to the north. I remember Dad, still in his thirties, telling 
		the powerful three in Oakland–––Capwell and Taft of department store 
		wealth, and Tribune newspaper mogul Joseph Knowland–––that the city 
		should dig another tunnel through the hills for automobiles. Their 
		reaction? &quot;If we do that people will move to the country.&quot; Dad’s 
		rejoinder was, &quot;They are going there anyway. If you don’t build the 
		tunnel, they won’t come into the city and buy in your stores.&quot; 
		Prophetic? You bet. And another Lyon characteristic was showing up. An 
		ability to recognize and assemble emotion-free facts that kept Dad 
		seeming to be well ahead of his time, most of the time. This is not 
		always a blessing I have since learned.<br><br>My dad<br><br>Dad’s story 
		really began when he graduated from Oakland High School. He was the rare 
		one who chose to go to college. The University of California was close 
		by. There he was known as the calculator guru. He was pictured that way 
		in the Yearbook of 1906. One day I asked Dad why he chose to go to 
		college in a time when the trades were flourishing. He said, &quot;I wanted 
		to get an equal start with the best.&quot; Thus it was that in the moving and 
		storage industry, he and the Bekins brothers all were college educated, 
		and led the field throughout the country, especially when they became 
		founders of such long distance moving companies as Allied and Bekins. 
		Dad often mentioned that small local competitors, almost always 
		restricted to a van or two, did not have the advantage that education 
		provided. Dad would always be there with a helping hand. Thank goodness 
		they had the altruistic guidance of men like Dad, who cherished 
		competition but demanded it be the best it could be.<br><br>It was in 
		Danville that I first tasted school, a walk a mile to the east. I would 
		saunter back and forth each day with schoolmates recently immigrated 
		from Mexico. They had already picked up American English and 
		conversation was rich. We all carried lunch boxes and Mom would load 
		mine with goodies. My first grade teacher was Ruth Sorrick. I learned 
		later that I was the only blue-eyed blonde in her room of twenty or so. 
		And I was in hog heaven, for we all were encouraged to think and learn. 
		My classmates were alert and friendly. I think that had a tremendous 
		influence in making me so unconscious of ethnic backgrounds. Their dark 
		complexions and jet black hair were truly beautiful, and how we laughed 
		and played together.<br><br>One day Mom was in the center of Danville, 
		moving toward the bank to make a withdrawal. She was driving the Pierce 
		that day. She saw a man run out of the bank with a bag in his hand, 
		presumably stolen cash. The alarm was sounded and the sheriff 
		commandeered the powerful Pierce to make chase. Did the robber get away? 
		I think so. He might not have, had Dad been at the wheel. <br><br>That 
		was an idyllic world I know now, but I don’t have to look back and wish 
		I had understood that at the time. Why? Well, my parents constantly 
		demanded we appreciate the joys and blessings each day as just that––to 
		take nothing for granted. And it is the same for me today. If these are 
		God’s gifts, I say, &quot;Thank you.&quot; If these are Man’s gifts, I say, &quot;Thank 
		you for Man.&quot;<br><br>We return to the city<br><br>

		<img class="auto-style27" height="251" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/cars776.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>After 
		two years in the country it was time to return to the big city and its 
		challenges. Just before picking up stakes, my teacher, Miss Sorrick, 
		became Mrs. Lamborn. The blond blue-eyed &quot;teacher’s pet&quot; was the ring 
		bearer, and, for the first time I found myself playing hide and 
		seek—should I say flirting—with Jeanie, Ruth Lamborn’s niece and my 
		companion going down the aisle. I didn’t give in to her entreaties for a 
		kiss. Guess I blew it, and that would not be the last time.<br><br>By 
		this time Dad’s business was booming. We moved blocks up the social 
		ladder to Piedmont and 306 Sheridan, an English two-story house on a 
		narrow lot, surrounded by more imposing residences. It was just a mile 
		from Havens Grammar School and Piedmont High School, all on level 
		ground, easy to negotiate on bicycle, roller skates, or scooter. It’s 
		hard to believe now that a small bike was then a curiosity. Dad, always 
		resourceful, managed to find a much used one. Ted and I, as well as the 
		rest of the neighborhood, became cyclists by sitting on the bike and 
		pushing off from the curb. It was self-instruction at its best.<br><br>How did we live? Mom could now have 
		wonderful, supportive help with cooking and cleaning, as well as demand 
		a little discipline for the obstreperous three boys. Twelve quarts of 
		milk were delivered each day, and the despised cod liver oil was 
		replaced with a delicious expensive mix called Kepler’s Malt Extract. 
		Mom was presented with her new revolutionary electric mixer, the 
		KitchenAid. It was supposed to do everything. Applesauce was its number 
		one product, and I developed the trick of always mixing it in my milk, 
		something I still do today. And then there were the dishes. I have had a 
		lifetime familiarity with this because it was our chore after each meal 
		and continued to be my chore, among others, when I hashed my way in the 
		dining hall of Encina in my first Stanford year. There I set the tables 
		for 24, served, and then after setting up for the next meal, went 
		through the dishwashing routine. We hashers, for the most part athletes, 
		would sweep through the swinging doors, our trays with 24 glasses of 
		milk balanced above with one hand while the other hand opened the 
		swinging door. It must have been like a ballet, I think, looking back at 
		the wonders of being just a youth. <br><br>Why bring up this mundane 
		dishwashing activity? It was because I learned something else from my 
		Dad on how to get out of an odious job at home. Mom would say, &quot;Harvey, 
		get in here and help the boys.&quot; Dad would roll up his sleeves, grab a 
		plate, somehow then letting it slip and crash to the floor. He had made 
		sure it was not one of Mom’s cherished Dresden cups or saucers. Mom, 
		then suckered, would exclaim, &quot;Harvey, you’re always so clumsy. Get out 
		of here.&quot; A couple of winks by Dad at us boys, and he was back to his 
		newspaper. I haven’t had the opportunity to repeat that stunt. Could it 
		be that my coordination won’t allow it? I doubt that, particularly after 
		dropping and smashing a priceless Sevres cup when I broke the packing 
		rules as a &quot;packer&quot; on a moving job. I had been told more than once by 
		an experienced packer to always open a package over the barrel so if 
		something slipped it would have a soft landing. The owner of the cup was 
		a doll, thankfully, but the price of the cup made the lesson stick. I 
		was beginning to realize that mentors were always around if one just 
		listened.<br><br>How did Mom cope with the energies of three boys, 
		keeping them out of the trouble that seems the outlet for so many 
		without homes and caring parents? Well, one of the prices paid was our 
		furniture. We would wrestle in the front room, older, stronger Dick 
		usually putting Ted on his back with a hammerlock, until Bruce, five 
		years younger than me, insisted on getting his share of the action. It 
		wasn’t long before he would then hammerlock me from behind with Ted 
		down, thereby freeing Ted and winning the day. And then we would take 
		the long footrest from the front of the fireplace, place it in the 
		middle of the floor. Because there were three steps into the room, the 
		top of the steps was ideal for a running flying leap onto it. Needless 
		to say, springs rapidly flattened, and rather than get a new 
		replacement, Mom faced reality and kept the target in place until two of 
		us were off to college.<br><br>Bruce, with his living-room strength, had 
		the serenity we would all like to have. It came to the point that the 
		Havens School bully, an older sixth grader, challenged Bruce. He 
		immediately found himself vanquished as he was pinned to the macadam by 
		Bruce’s hammerlock. From that day on, Reg Kittrell was a pussy cat and 
		one of Bruce's best friends. I believe that was the only physical 
		confrontation any of us three boys ever encountered. So, unlike Bill 
		O’Reilly, was our compliance with reality a bad thing? Not at all. Early 
		on we three decided that even if our assailant got two black eyes and 
		lost the match, the price of being the winner with one black eye was a 
		price too high to pay.<br><br><br><br>Grammar school <br><br><br><br>
		What took place in grammar school that might have been a glimpse of what 
		was to follow? Third grade teacher Mrs. Haas, in her Mexican costumes, 
		planted the seeds leading to a lifetime desire to know the outside 
		world. My sixth grade teacher, Mrs. White, believed music should play a 
		major part in our lives ahead. She played and replayed such classics as 
		Meditation from Thais and Night on Bald Mountain, planting more seeds 
		that have blossomed and enriched my life. Perhaps most revealing of the 
		lifetime ahead was two years in Mrs. Lohse’s Latin class. Was this 
		searcher for ways to remember even then fascinated by the stems from 
		which our western languages have sprung?<br><br><br><br>Our first and 
		last larceny<br><br><br><br>One of my vivid memories of those years took 
		place when I was 13 and Ted 11–––the &quot;Charleston Candy Bar&quot; incident. 
		Dad always gave us our 25-cent allowance each week to be used for 
		whatever we wished, such as a Saturday trip to the Piedmont Theater 
		which required the streetcar ride to and from. Candy that would rot our 
		teeth was not on the accepted list. <br><br>Dad had a second method to 
		dispense the nickels and dimes we required to take the street car all 
		the way to Oakland for the essentials such as a visit to the dentist. 
		Ted and I knew very well that we were cheating, even stealing, when we 
		found ourselves taking more than was needed; we were breaking Dad’s 
		trust. How could this occur when both of us new clearly the difference 
		between right and wrong? Mr. Springman, pharmacist and proprietor of our 
		one pharmacy, also wondered about this. He phoned my Dad in his office 
		in the early morning saying, &quot;Mr. Lyon, have you been allowing the boys 
		to buy chocolate bars on their way to school?&quot; Thirty minutes later Dad 
		appeared in Principal Harry Jones’ office. He had a chore to perform and 
		would like to take his two boys home.<br><br>Into each classroom he 
		marched and, with finger beckoning, led us to the car and home and 
		upstairs where the looted bank was checked and the guilt assured. We 
		happily admitted culpability: Let’s pay up and get off the conscience 
		hook. <br><br>Dad did his needed part. Nothing was said. Down came two 
		pairs of pants, and Dad’s hand reddened, hurting as he administered our 
		first real spankings. Our reactions, not spoken but nevertheless 
		transmitted, were in essence, &quot;Thanks Dad, we cheated. We have paid the 
		price.&quot; Thank you for what? No amount of discussion or reasoning was 
		necessary. We were stuck in our transgressions. Convicted, sentenced, 
		punished, and guilt removed, we could get back on stride. If that is 
		corporal punishment, so be it. It works, leaving no doubt as to right 
		and wrong. The debt is paid. Sure beats talking!<br><br>Looking back, I 
		have wondered why we didn’t just on our own &quot;’fess up.&quot; I’m guessing 
		that we were also putting Dad to the test. Did he really mean what he 
		said about honesty and personal responsibility? Were we, having already 
		committed our crime, wondering how long it would take for Dad with his 
		adding machine mind to discover the robbery of his &quot;till&quot;? Dad trusted 
		his sons and would never have counted the nickels and dimes each week, 
		anticipating a robbery. It took Mr. Springman, outsider and real friend, 
		to accept the responsibility. How wonderful to have been allowed this 
		mistake, to then pay the bill once and for all and clean the slate, no 
		discussion required. Once was enough!<br><br><br><br>We adjust to high 
		school<br><br><br><br>Junior high school’s two years opened new vistas 
		as Mrs. Grover had us study the world, its peoples and geography. My 
		report on Uruguay lit an interest in the outer world that is just as 
		ardent today. These 7th and 8th grades were the first steps into high 
		school. Our classes changed radically. Most dramatic was the mingling of 
		students from Beach School in lower Piedmont from working blue-collar 
		families and our top of the world bunch, almost without exception from 
		from the moderately well-to-do to the very rich families consisting of 
		executives on both sides of the Bay. Could one be aware of any 
		difference? I for one could not, and our friendships knew no 
		limitations. <br><br>The girls all wore uniforms, as in most private 
		schools. I will always believe that the well-pressed quilted black 
		skirts, and loose white middies made an immense difference, stimulating 
		the boys to dress with the same neatness and without pretense. This is a 
		practice that today should be a starting point for inner-city schools, 
		the government paying for these uniforms that level the playing field 
		and stimulate classroom performance through personal pride<br><br>Yes, 
		we had clubs, but these were for the most part unpretentious. I was a 
		Kimmer, mostly drawn from upper Piedmont. Many of my best friends were 
		Rigmas, from the other side of the tracks, so to speak. I don’t remember 
		much competition, save as to the type of soft drink each would serve at 
		parties. As athletes, there was no club loyalty, and if initiations were 
		the same, Ted and I would have hated both. The inane use of the paddle 
		to soften up us new members was primitive. By the time we two had 
		finished our high school years, we had made sure the use of paddles was 
		on the skids. I remember so well that I received some fifty blows––yes, 
		I counted them––and finally turned to my tormentors saying, &quot;You guys 
		might as well quit. My butt is numb and you’re wasting both of our 
		times.&quot; On the other hand, Ted’s fanny was swollen and red. No wonder we 
		condemned the whole thing. <br><br>It was clear from the very start that 
		Mom and Dad approved of our determination to treat our companions as we 
		would like to be treated, and that is still the rule. I now think that 
		&quot;empathy&quot; was heavily in our genes right from the start, aided and 
		abetted by my parents, who made sure their sons understood that the most 
		offhand remark must be recognized for the meaning it carried to others.<br>
		<br><br><br>Forming our views of the world<br><br><br><br>Looking back, 
		I realize that skin color was never an issue. Takeo Hamamoto was our 
		number one tennis player and greatly loved. He had come to America, 
		surely from a leading family in Japan, and was making his way as a 
		houseboy. To us this was admirable. How I wish I had followed him to the 
		internment camp as the war with Japan began. I never understood why 
		President Roosevelt was not better advised. He should have allowed these 
		wonderful people to return to their homes and as Americans, to aid the 
		war effort. I understood the need to initially get them off the streets 
		and protected from militant kooks, but we missed the boat. As the years 
		went by and I worked with Japanese-American nurses, I became convinced 
		that no ethnic group more quickly adapts to our ways. This was 
		buttressed by our later prewar experiences as we traveled the world, 
		Japan our starting point. My point is that our home training left no 
		doubt that our judgments of others, and ourselves, would have only one 
		dimension. This was quite simply &quot;character.&quot; And it is the same for me 
		today.<br><br>Piedmont High School daily took me closer to the time I 
		would have to leave the protection of home and community as the step to 
		college must be made. Somehow, I was acutely conscious of the blessings 
		I was enjoying, not really looking forward to college, where the big 
		decisions would be made. Some of my friends were anxious to get away and 
		get started toward clearly defined careers. Easily, the embryo doctors 
		led the list. Engineers, writers, and artists seemed to follow. I, on 
		the other hand, chose to wait and let the chips of direction fall. I was 
		in no hurry to confront responsibility. I milked each day for all of its 
		worth.<br><br><br><br>A non-combative world for me as mentors appear<br>
		<br><br><br>
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/family525_2.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="330" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/family525_2.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>In 
		personal histories, often a great deal of time is given to demonstrating 
		one’s ability to court confrontation while not compromising principles. 
		This was not an option for me. I don’t remember a single instance of 
		such combat, nor do I remember compromising on principles. We brothers 
		seemed to have sensed from the start that we did not require the 
		approbation of others to follow our inclinations. Combat? Yes, on the 
		basketball court or rugby field, as part of the team. Yet, I saw this as 
		just fun and admired so often the abilities of the athlete who was my 
		opponent. I remember being benched in a basketball game with USC when 
		the &quot;almost All American&quot; center out maneuvered me for a lay-up basket. 
		I hit him on the fanny with my hand, saying &quot;Nice going, Gale.&quot; Coach 
		Dean’s advice was &quot;Get mad.&quot; I didn’t know how. I stayed benched for the 
		rest of the game.<br><br>We Lyon brothers had parents who always took 
		part to the degree that Dad and Mom were each presidents of the 
		respective Fathers and Mothers Clubs for as long as five years. Didn’t 
		anyone else want these jobs? Perhaps, but I never heard a criticism. 
		This pattern of accomplishment extended to Oakland’s Children's 
		Hospital, as well as to the local business and charity organizations, 
		Mom’s almost-Presidency of the National DAR, and Dad’s Presidency of the 
		National Warehousemans’ Association. Were we boys impressed? I don’t 
		believe so, for we saw our parents just as feeling obligated to be 
		effective in anything thrust upon them. Sounds too good to be true, I 
		guess, but this was an ingredient manifest in most communities in the 
		America of that day. And when our parents funded and thus created the 
		Bruce Lyon Children's Hospital Research Laboratory as a memorial, it was 
		just the natural thing to do, no matter the family largess that was 
		required. The Bruce Lyon Grove of redwoods at the Oregon-California line 
		carries the same message.<br><br>Humor was part 
		of our daily fare. At the dinner table Dad would tell us his latest 
		joke, the punch line of which he had already posted in his little black 
		book. He accumulated one book for each year, kept them in his dresser, 
		and then at the end of a long lifetime must have discarded them. They 
		were lost to his boys. No matter; his sons knew almost all by heart, so 
		often did he tell them to illustrate a point. I have that habit today 
		and call them shaggy dog stories, not sure that today’s listeners think 
		them at all funny, but Dad was famous in the Bay Area for his fund of 
		jokes. Prominent men such as UC Berkeley President Robert Sproul and 
		Oakland District Attorney Earl Warren would drop in for a story 
		befitting a specific occasion, the latter even as Chief Justice of the 
		United States Supreme Court. His best jokes seemed to be pointed at 
		one’s self, demonstrating a kind of humility, I think. I like to believe 
		that this is really the case, because it seems to be familial. Taking 
		one’s self too seriously is a tough load to bear.<br><br><br><br>Dad’s 
		booby prize<br><br><br><br>Sometime in the 1920s, when Dad was president 
		of the California Warehousemans’ Association, he went to Florida for a 
		convention, played golf, and came back with the booby prize, a tiny 
		alligator. That little organism somehow made the five-day train trip 
		home. He was &quot;fenced&quot; in the back yard and grew large enough to threaten 
		our chow dog, Ching, so Dad made a deal with the owner of the plush 
		Broadway Restaurant in Oakland with its multiple fountains. And for 
		several weeks or months he was an attraction there until he started 
		chasing the waitresses. He ended up as the first reptile in the new 
		Oakland Zoo in Montclair, a happy beginning for hopefully a long life 
		from prize to perpetuity, since alligators have long life spans.<br><br>
		<br><br>My first mentors, after Mom and Dad<br><br><br><br>How many of 
		my teachers became mentors for me? What is a mentor? There are teachers 
		from whom we learn, but teachers become mentors when they discern 
		something in one that lies perhaps undiscovered that must be encouraged 
		to blossom.<br><br>First there was Brick Johnson, a Scot if there ever 
		was one, so strong, demanding, and principled. His bagpipe band was the 
		real thing. I practiced on my chanter by the hour, but could never be 
		available to play the pipes because I was on the playing field, being 
		encouraged on by them. Brick was also my Sunday School teacher. He 
		characterized Christ in a way that has impacted me to this day. He said, 
		&quot;Christ was a powerful man, not as he appears so often in art. Could any 
		of you in the best of condition carry that cross to the top of the 
		hill?&quot;<br><br>Brick was co-coach with Sam Moyer and believed that men 
		are made on the field of competition–––football in this case. There was 
		another believer, Harry Jones, our principal. Each year he would tell 
		the story to the 1,200 of us of his exploits as a teacher in a tiny 
		Midwestern school, where student ages ranged from 12 to 22, all in one 
		room. He had a physical confrontation or two and quickly decided there 
		must be a better way. Pop Warner, now legendary, had written a small 
		book entitled, The Forward Pass. Book in hand, Mr. Jones found two 
		receivers, and a boy-man who could throw the ball. For three years this 
		tiny school won the state championship, finally taking on the collegiate 
		normal schools and defeating them by scores into the nineties. <br><br>
		What was the secret of such success? It was a combination of surprise 
		and habit. It took years for the surprise to end, as habit gave way to a 
		better way to play. What was the lesson to me? Although we pride 
		ourselves in adapting to something new each day, in fact change is more 
		likely to be slow. It would be years before I would test this principle.<br>
		<br>It was Principal Jones’ contention that it was on the football field 
		where one becomes a man. I was in the 10th grade, beginning to sprout to 
		an eventual 6’2” with the 126-pound weight of a bean pole, really little 
		different from a newborn colt. The appeal to manhood was so effective 
		that ninety boys showed up, and ninety uniforms were filled. I succumbed 
		and was given the ninetieth uniform, a ratty affair, putting me on the 
		ninth and last string. I was bottom of the line, but that seemed to be 
		not a factor, for we all had to learn how to tackle and block. It would 
		have been wiser to send me on the run with the order to catch. But, no, 
		first I had to learn to tackle. Guess who was my first runner? It was 
		the Coach’s son, first-string fullback Dick Moyer, 5’6” and a rolling 
		ball of sheer, hard muscle.<br><br>I promptly decided I really wasn’t 
		ready yet to be a man. My young, growing, loosely-protected bones would 
		shatter just to have Dick Moyer look at me. I ran to the sports house 
		and into Coach Brick’s office, shedding my suit, claiming cowardice. To 
		my amazement, he laughed and said, &quot;Take off that suit and go up to the 
		gym and grab a basketball.&quot; That did it. I wasn’t a coward after all, 
		and he had better plans for me as he directed me to the sport that would 
		make me All Conference center and then a teammate of the man who would 
		change the game, Angelo &quot;Hank&quot; Luisetti. <br><br>Beyond Mom and Dad, 
		mentors like Brick were just beginning to appear. I had quite wonderful 
		teachers, not in the roles of serious mentors. There was Mrs. Beebe, who 
		tried without success to make me write using the Palmer full-arm method. 
		I would get a B at best. I could not satisfy Mom’s desire to see me with 
		all A’s to make her sure I was as smart as buddy Albert Rowe. He, like 
		his famous dad, a pioneer in Allergy, was on his way to being a doctor. 
		I made a deal with Mrs. Beebe: If she would promise not to watch me as I 
		wrote with hand motion alone and grade me instead on the written results 
		that deserved an A, I could please Mom. Once straight A’s reached home, 
		Mom was satisfied. I said, &quot;Mom, that’s it.&quot; I could return to 
		imperfection, and did. <br><br>Dr. Niemann, chemistry teacher, although 
		full of imaginative presentations, could not pierce my inability to 
		memorize easily. The need to use trial and error in constructing an 
		equation left me cold. Even then trial and error was the last thing I 
		wished to use in speeding my understanding of truths that would guide my 
		life. Mr. Banker, historian, was also a fine source of historical facts, 
		but didn’t quite have the enthusiasm to give facts life.<br><br>
		Mr.Weingarten was the winner, as far as I was concerned. Algebra was my 
		joy. It didn’t have to be memorized. Understanding it just required 
		common sense, my long suit conditioned by a dad who exuded it. Geometry 
		was a close second as it stimulated the small bit of the artist in me, 
		suspending Algebra in the third dimension of space. But, then came 
		Trigonometry. I didn’t know then why it was so difficult.<br><br>Years 
		of experience later revealed that I had a serious deficiency, by 
		teaching standards. I couldn’t memorize what I couldn’t quickly 
		understand. A formula demanding a complex of plusses and minuses all 
		square-rooted had to be taken at face value. I simply couldn’t do it, 
		and this deficiency would later play a major role in directing me to my 
		life’s work. The Process Mind was beginning to manifest itself.<br><br>
		And then there was Assistant Principal Bolenbaugh, who installed me as 
		head of the Student Council, charged with discipline and moral issues. 
		He knew even then that I would be unlikely to win the popular vote and 
		hold an elective office. That had already transpired when Chaffee Hall, 
		un-athlete of the year, dearest friend and the Daily editor, whipped me 
		in the election for the most coveted job, Commissioner of Entertainment. 
		The irony and final nail in my political coffin was the fact that Dad 
		was providing most of the entertainers. I would seem be the logical 
		choice. Dad performed the same service for Chaffee. <br><br>Mr. 
		Seagrist, our Physics teacher, made the course fun for me as it was a 
		challenge to understand physical laws that guided so much of our lives. 
		The quick memorizers did their thing and scored well. I, on the other 
		hand, had the privilege of working to understand. I guess my A was well 
		deserved. I was beginning to accept that I had to understand principles 
		and theorems before I could commit them to a memory that wasn’t 
		overnight but would likely last a lifetime. In retrospect this has 
		turned out to be the case.<br><br>Mr. Hampton, always a little 
		absentminded, never learned of the risks I blithely took when I chose as 
		my term project, chromium plating. This required a combination of 
		chemicals that produced toxic cyanide gas as an end-product. How to get 
		rid of this? In our basement I boiled my mixture under a large funnel 
		and hose directed outside to exhaust the gasses. I survived the process 
		and received an A. You can be sure I kept the matter to myself, and 
		accepted that at times a little bit of luck is a very good thing. I 
		shudder now as I look back at my innocence.<br><br><br><br>Before and 
		after &quot;The Crash&quot;<br><br><br><br>

		well remember one day on Sheridan in 1928 that Dad had caught me leaving 
		the the front bathroom. He stepped in closed the door, and said, &quot;Dick, 
		I have to tell someone. Your Dad is a millionaire.&quot; Guess I must have 
		said, &quot;Nice going.&quot; I recall that I was not impressed, for our living 
		habits were wholesome and not changing, Soon after, however, we moved 
		into the Big House at 25 Crocker, with a porte-cochere and all the 
		fixings. <br><br>As I started Junior High School, the Crash of ‘29 began 
		to take it's toll. We were then living in what I called &quot;The Big House&quot; 
		on the most prominent corner in Piedmont, Crocker and Wildwood. Three 
		years earlier as Dad prospered, he bought the Abbott house and spent 
		$25,000 renovating it. It was a spacious colonial mansion, its interior 
		almost entirely the dark woods of mahogany brought from the Far East. It 
		was impressive but oppressive. Off-white paint covering this magnificent 
		wood made it light and airy. Each of us three boys had our own bedroom 
		and bath for which we chose their colors. Mine was an impressive green 
		with black trim. In a way, we reveled in our new luxury, but the price 
		included much garden work for us and Mom. The garden work paid 25 cents 
		an hour, pure wealth. Dad, with his usual foresight to cover the 
		improbables of the future, rented the 306 Sheridan house as a backup. It 
		was just two blocks away.<br><br>Life on Crocker in our mansion called 
		for more help. In Piedmont grandee style, my parents hired our first 
		Chinese cook, Lee Wong. Loyal, pigtailed servants were fixtures in the 
		homes of most of the the truly wealthy families. He never took a day 
		off, living in his small kitchen-side room. Can one imagine this change 
		in lifestyle for three boys brought up in a single desk-filled room with 
		one closet, three beds on a porch, and within 200 feet of trolleys that 
		constantly banged as they switched night and day? In truth, if there was 
		a quiet holiday, the silence would awaken us with a &quot;What’s that?&quot; from 
		one of us. Our second new household member was a &quot;house boy&quot; from the 
		Philippines. It was serene for a few weeks, but when Lee went after the 
		house boy with a kitchen knife, we realized that Lee was quite enough, 
		and the chores of making beds and Saturday cleaning were back in place 
		for the three of us.<br><br>I don’t think anyone around us took much 
		notice of the new inhabitants until Dad saw beautiful white cutout deer 
		lighting up a Christmas display on Piedmont’s most imposing lawn just a 
		few blocks away, that of Wallace Alexander. Dad got the idea 
		immediately. He brought the two life-sized paper maché lions from his 
		warehouse, and we placed them appropriately on the lawn beside a fir 
		tree. A scattering of make-believe snow completed the tableau. Cars 
		going by almost crashed with drivers astonished at Africa in the cold. 
		That did it! Mom ordered Dad to cease and desist, especially when 
		someone accused her of advertising Let Lyon Guard Your Goods. <br><br>
		Almost over night, Dad descended from millionaire status to a debtor of 
		a million dollars. How did Dad survive such times? He went to each bank 
		and, in so many words, said, &quot;If I am forced into bankruptcy, you will 
		get nothing. If I agree to pay you 50 cents on the dollar in 
		installments, you will gain the most and perhaps I will survive.&quot; They 
		were convinced. Over the next nine years Dad, bag in hand, collected 
		moneys from such as the parking lot he had owned next to the Paramount 
		Theater. Dad had invested heavily in Oakland prime property. The banks 
		had been too lenient in allowing loans that within a matter of weeks 
		were more than the properties were worth as their values plummeted.<br>

		<img class="auto-style27" height="199" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/sheridan206.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>As 
		the world came tumbling down, we moved again back to 306 Sheridan, lock 
		stock and barrel. It seems odd, but I don’t remember much about the 
		move. It just seemed that we were really home again. The small family 
		room again was graced by the Philco radio, but the furniture breathed a 
		sigh of relief as our energies, now more channeled, did not include 
		wrestling. It was back to the single three-boy bedroom, now a little 
		smaller as we all became bigger. But the fit was easy, and life for us 
		just took up where it had left off. Mom no longer would be weary from 
		the incessant demands of a large garden. We boys had a smaller lawn to 
		weed and mow. Our weekly stipends of 25 cents were not cut, but the 
		chances for added cents became limited. At the same time, Dad was each 
		day making his deposit in the bank to pick away at each loan. That took 
		nine years of daily humbling. The memory is fresh today of Dad stopping 
		me in the rough at the brow of Orinda Country Club’s fourth hole. As it 
		was that day in the bathroom, Dad said, &quot;Dick I must tell you something. 
		Your Dad doesn’t owe a single cent to anyone.&quot; If his eyes didn’t tear 
		at that moment, I would be surprised, for my eyes tear today just with 
		the thought.<br><br>Dad saved Lyon Storage and Moving Co. with the help 
		of $17,000 from grandmother Richards, then, occupying our guest room. It 
		was a mighty tight squeeze. Still nursing his pride, Dad could now 
		afford only an Oldsmobile. For a year he parked around the block in 
		hiding. He believed he must maintain the mantle of success. I suspect it 
		was a help. Several Piedmont friends took their lives for insurance 
		support for families. Mr. Hamby lost his magnificent grocery store as 
		the wealthy ran up immense bills, never repaid until too late. <br><br>
		<br><br>True Grit, as we look back<br><br><br><br>Dad demonstrated the 
		truth of his lessons to his sons as he took his beatings without a 
		moment of self pity. I never heard a complaint as he recognized his poor 
		judgment, although events that took place had been correctly anticipated 
		by only a few. But an event just before The Crash throws light on the 
		values he passed on to his sons, these values having a price.<br><br>In 
		1927, two years before The Crash, Dad decided to expand Lyon Storage and 
		Moving Co. by adding a second unit in San Francisco. Things must have 
		been going well, for this was the prosperous run-up to 1929. He acquired 
		perhaps the choicest property in San Francisco. It was directly across 
		from the City Hall in the Civic Center. Today it is hard to believe that 
		finding and acquiring such a nugget was possible. The warehouse was to 
		be the finest in America and a standard for fire proofing advances that 
		assured storage safety. The foundation was complete and the first floor 
		underway, with $10,000 worth of steel already delivered. Then the axe 
		fell. Horace Clifton, chairman of the San Francisco Board knew that a 
		fine orchestra would remain a dream without a true Opera House. It was 
		now put up or shut up, all set in motion by Dad’s foresight. The city 
		fathers gave in. The property was condemned for public use but Dad was 
		offered any other available property he would choose.<br><br>Dad, in the 
		meantime, had second thoughts about this new venture. Crossing the Bay 
		meant lost time on the ferry each way daily–––no bridge then–––and this 
		time had become precious for it invaded time at home with his family. I 
		believe he quietly sighed with relief, reclaiming the funds and happy to 
		be a big guy in then a little pond.<br><br>The story now takes an 
		unexpected twist, for this was the heyday of property and stock market 
		values. He took the funds and bought TransAmerica stock, believing it 
		golden at a value of over $200 a share. Over the next two years, it 
		steadily worked its way down. Only when it reached $100 did he ask his 
		sons’ opinions, our ages to 7 to 12. Our decision was unanimous: &quot;Sell.&quot; 
		Dad didn't take our advice, and then watched TransAmerica plunge to 
		zero. That was when the full impact of The Crash hit home. No tears from 
		Dad. He would just &quot;gut it out.&quot; Lessons for his boys? You have only 
		yourself to blame when things go badly. Quietly, bite your lip and get 
		on with making the very best of it.<br><br><br>Life-preserver golf<br><br><br><br>It would seem that a sport would just 
		provide delightful memories throughout our growing years, but in our 
		case, golf was something quite different. It came close to being a way 
		of life, teaching us lessons that would help us through difficult times 
		yet ahead. <br><br>Dad, in his prime, had been a founder of Orinda 
		Country Club, a gem in the hills just one half hour away from home. We 
		three boys and Dad started playing as we reached age ten. This was a 
		family affair from the start. The Sunday picnic on our lot, intended for 
		a home someday, was followed by the Lyon eighteen-hole foursome, Mom 
		biding her time reading and knitting. Dad, even with all of his worries, 
		kept our game a ritual. <br><br>Ted and I became proficient golfers, 
		making up the second pair on the high school team. We never lost a 
		match. It was years later that I recognized why. Younger brother Ted, 
		with his consistent, upright, finely-honed swing went right down the 
		middle. I rarely was able to best him. I, on the other hand, was a bit 
		wild, but long. In our matches, at about the fifteenth hole, we would 
		begin to pull away. Why? Because our opponents would start to spray 
		their shots as they tried to get the longest drives. I would often do 
		the same, while Ted went down the middle and we won the closing holes. 
		Our golfing buddies couldn’t understand why we wouldn’t be intent on 
		competing with them more often and thereby improve our games. We never 
		offered an explanation. We just played as a family together.<br><br>The 
		finale to all this is that when Dad’s world came crashing down, his sons 
		were his shock-absorbers–––always there and ready to go. The country 
		club should have been one of the casualties, and our golf therapy for 
		Dad would have been denied. Was someone looking after us, we wondered, 
		for Dad’s founder’s lifetime membership demanded no dues, and our locker 
		was $1 a month? Golf balls? No problem. After the Sunday game, we 
		trekked back to the thickets lining the course. Ted somehow found just 
		new balls. I found mostly “rocks,” but we shared everything, of course.<br>
		<br>To this day, golfing buddies can’t understand my attitude towards 
		the game. It is the same in other &quot;one on one&quot; sports such as tennis and 
		swimming. There must be something wrong with me if I am to judge from 
		the many books on individuals where winning is &quot;the name of the game.&quot; 
		It is true I didn’t like to lose so often to brother Ted, but at the 
		same time I gained no joy out of being the winner. To this day, this 
		intent is the same. I prefer to come out even, both of us having played 
		a fine game. Many times as I faced a one-foot putt to win, something 
		inside would trip my hand to make me miss. Had the putt been necessary 
		for me to secure a tie, I would calm myself and sink it, usually. We 
		would be even. My joy has always been in the game that I played within 
		myself. <br><br><br><br>My future: doors kept open ahead<br><br>
		<br><br>I was 14, and beginning to think about what I would like to do 
		with my life. Our year studying the outer world in geography class in 
		junior high school rang the bell. The outside world, so far away, seemed 
		almost inaccessible, but it beckoned. I would join the Foreign Service 
		and see that world. What could give me a helping hand? Practical from 
		the start, I imagined diplomats in white tropical suits, long pants and 
		all, cavorting on the tennis courts. Golf then was still in its 
		diplomatic infancy. A first step then would be to become competent in 
		tennis, and I could be a desired partner on the courts when ambassadors 
		needed talented partners to win their contests. <br><br>This was later 
		borne out when Dr. Bill Smart, dear friend and champion golfer, as a 
		mere Lieutenant would in innocence walk through the officers mess on his 
		aircraft carrier in golf attire. His golf cleats clanged on the deck 
		before he stepped into the Admiral’s gig for a game that day. And we 
		were at war! <br><br>Berkeley Tennis Club was a major center of great 
		tennis. Locals Helen Wills and Dorothy Jacobs were world champions. I 
		took the street cars, changing as necessary, and met with the tennis 
		pro, Mr. George Hudson. He agreed to give me 10 lessons at $4 a lesson. 
		I had $40 from weekend gardening jobs. The ten weeks went rapidly by. I 
		was given a firm basis for a classic free-swinging game, although there 
		was no time in between to practice. Nevertheless, my game was good 
		enough to make the third pair of Piedmont’s team, while golf and 
		basketball teams were not neglected.<br><br>So, what is my point in 
		telling this story? It is to strive to be taught only by the &quot;best&quot; 
		right from the start. If it requires long rides on the trolley cars, so 
		what. Just make it work. So Do It Now.<br><br><br><br>Away from home at 
		college and value of the name Lyon<br><br><br><br>
		<a href="Dick&#32;Pied&#32;1.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="379" src="Dick&#32;Pied&#32;1.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>Graduation 
		meant the first major change in a life pattern so ordered thus far. In 
		1934 it was time to break the comforting and ever encouraging bonds of 
		home. What did I wish to be? I hadn’t the slightest idea, for my talents 
		seemed so ordinary in the face of my buddies with gifts in music, art, 
		and writing. We were confirmed &quot;Golden Bears,&quot; and UC Berkeley was to be 
		the next step in preparing for my life’s work. At this time I was 
		high-point man, the center, on a winning basketball team. I had earned 
		&quot;All Conference&quot; status. So, along with 10 others originating in the 
		western states, I was offered a scholarship at Stanford. Dad’s doubts 
		about financing my college education without my living at home were 
		relieved.<br><br>Then came the June surprise: Coach John Bunn called to 
		say that the Board of Athletic Control denied my scholarship because the 
		name Lyon of Lyon Storage and Moving with its slogan, Let Lyon Guard 
		Your Goods was too well known. Stanford could not be seen to be 
		subsidizing wealth. This was in the early days of Dad’s recovery. 
		Technically, he was still broke. I faced Dad in the back porch that 
		evening.<br><br>&quot;Dad,&quot; I said, &quot;How much is the name Lyon worth?&quot;<br>
		<br>Dad retorted, &quot;What do you mean by our name having worth? Give me a 
		figure?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dad, is it worth $345 a year?&quot; <br><br>&quot;What’s that?&quot;
		<br><br>&quot;That is the tuition at Stanford for a year. You give me the 
		scholarship and I’ll work my way through.&quot;<br><br>Dad said, &quot;OK. It’s a 
		deal.&quot; <br><br>Thus the Lyon Scholarship was created. He paid up and I 
		worked, hashing at Encina Hall as a freshman and then hashing again at 
		sororities. I worked for a small government grant doing book work and as 
		a private contractor washing &quot;well-to-do&quot; boys’ cars. I did odd jobs in 
		the summer, and in my last year all needs were met as house manager of 
		my fraternity.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 2 <br><br><br><br>I GO TO COLLEGE<br>
		<br><br><br>Stanford beginning<br><br><br><br>
		<a href="Laurie141.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="334" src="Laurie141.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>My 
		first quarter of the academic year was a difficult one. In order to get 
		by financially, I lived for three months in a small room with bath at 
		the back of Coach Bunn’s home. I never had a meal there, let alone saw 
		the dining room. Its distance from the campus meant arising early in 
		order to hash at Encina Hall, followed by a busy day of classes and 
		basketball practices. Not having a room at Encina Hall kept me from 
		getting into the swing beyond making new friends on the court. Weekends 
		at home were a refuge.<br><br>Something had to change! Dad agreed to 
		help with costs as I moved into Encina Hall in January and could then 
		take part in campus life, my hashing duties now next door. I would find 
		it a joy in the sophomore year to live in the fraternity house, my home 
		for the next three years, as well as the dining table later during the 
		months on campus in medical school.<br><br><br><br>I play basketball 
		with the coming star, Angelo Hank Luisetti <br><br><br><br>
		<a href="Hank&#32;1.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="295" src="Hank&#32;1.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>Hank 
		Luisetti proved to be all that was expected and a joy to be with on the 
		team. From the start the competition was intense. As the days wore on, 
		our diminutive, feisty, freshman coach tried different combinations. I 
		usually ended up with Hank as the other forward or as center. <br><br>We 
		started our season in Auburn, heralded there as the &quot;great team&quot; we were 
		on our way to becoming, winning all but one of our games. That game I 
		most remember for it was our opening encounter with the Cal frosh. We 
		gained our first dose of what a &quot;hot&quot; team could do. Cal players such as 
		Chet Carlisle and Ed Dougery couldn’t miss no matter from where they 
		threw the ball. We tried three kinds of defense yet lost miserably. The 
		irony was that each year for the next three, the same &quot;hot night&quot; 
		occurred at Cal, so that almost our only losses were these and they were 
		clearly won by Cal, to their absolute joy. I remember so well Dougery 
		just standing there and tossing while laughing in my face. Strangely, in 
		all my Stanford years, I don’t remember a hot Stanford team night. If 
		Hank couldn’t hit, he would shoot anyway, and then on a first or second 
		followup on the shot, ram it in, something no longer possible with the 
		giants under the basket.<br><br>Hank was the 
		consummate basketball player, the equal of the modern stars such as 
		Michael Jordan who seem so superior. This is largely because of their 
		freedom to take three steps instead of two, to palm the ball in the 
		dribble, and to strike the basket rim as they dunk. I have the clipping 
		telling of the foul I incurred as my wrist touched the net on a lay-up. 
		I guess &quot;white guys could jump.&quot; The dunk changed that, not to the 
		advantage of the game. I saw Hank make the first dribble behind his back 
		as he left the All American USC captain, Hal Dornsife, just standing 
		there, then throwing up his hands as though asking the crowd what they 
		would do. Hank’s defensive moves were unmatched even today.<br><br><br>
		<br>Engineering to Hygiene to Engineering<br><br><br><br>Now the 
		awakening! My first semester was a disaster, for Descriptive Geometry 
		turned out to be Trigonometry all over again, yet magnified. My 
		professor named Butter made me feel just &quot;too dumb to get it.&quot; I had no 
		intention of continuing if I couldn't &quot;get it.&quot; So I dropped my major 
		and switched to Hygiene, at least to get my breath and regroup.<br><br>
		At that low point I pinned Mom with the question, &quot;What was my IQ on the 
		Terman Test?&quot; Mom hesitated, but I was not to be denied. She said it was 
		136. What a relief! I wasn't anywhere near a genius at 140 or above, but 
		was in a range where I hoped sheer determination, persistence, and hard 
		work could make anything possible. I let things go at that until–a 
		miracle? Yes, I think so as I look back.<br><br>Dr. Harold Bacon (thank 
		goodness not Butter again), Professor of Mathematics, was the &quot;timer&quot; at 
		our freshman games. He had heard that I had dropped out of Engineering. 
		As a freshman, I was playing forward with Hank Luisetti, trying to 
		emulate his one-hand push shot that changed the game. Dr. Bacon asked me 
		to go back into Engineering and repeat the first year of math with him, 
		and somehow we would make it go. He backed up his promise, each week 
		devoting several hours to coaching what I know now was my Process Mind 
		to make sense of Descriptive Geometry, and Differential and Integral 
		Calculus. A key boost to my confidence came when I earned one of the 
		three A’s in Integral Calculus. The other two A students were in another 
		realm, I believed. They had done the assignments in an hour and were 
		playing pool when I asked for help.<br><br>Yes, HWDP–––Hard Work, 
		Determination, and Persistence–––could make the difference. I never 
		would doubt that again.<br><br><br><br>A big step that took years to 
		understand<br><br><br><br>Now a jump forward to cement the contention I 
		have just made. My Hydraulics course, considered the most demanding both 
		in substance and in performance, was taught by Dr. Hedburg, a 
		no-nonsense guy. As I walked into the final exam room, I was blown away 
		by the activity. Students were burning up their slide-rules, making 
		calculations seem easy. I panicked. <br><br>I asked Dr. Hedburg, &quot;May I 
		go to the House and do my exam, please. My head is spinning.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of 
		course.&quot; We both knew that no book could help.<br><br>Four hours later I 
		turned in my Blue Book. I commented that, &quot;I think I have flunked the 
		course.&quot;<br><br>His rejoinder, &quot;We’ll see.&quot; Two days later the blue book 
		arrived with an &quot;A&quot; on it.<br><br>I went to the engineering corner and 
		said to Dr. Hedburg &quot;I think you should look at this. Your corrector 
		must have made a mistake.&quot;<br><br>Dr. Hedburg said, &quot;There is no 
		mistake. In fact, you got the highest grade in the course.&quot;<br><br>
		&quot;Please, Sir, how could that be when I really didn’t know what I was 
		doing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, you derived every equation.&quot;<br><br>This statement 
		meant nothing to me at the time. Of course I was thankful for this 
		judgment. There was perhaps something worthwhile yet ahead. It took over 
		sixty years for me to understand the prediction of that day. It was my 
		Process Mind at work. It would pursue its course through all my 
		professional life, and even after. It would only be in the “after” of 
		retirement and time for contemplation that I would strive to understand 
		this Process in order that others like me with HWDP could early on 
		recognize their possibilities and then realize their full potentials. 
		The &quot;Straight A’s&quot; would not be able to keep up. <br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 
		3<br><br><br><br>1936 AROUND THE WORLD<br><br>
		<img alt="Lyon" class="auto-style26" height="242" src="1936_Page_13153.jpg" style="float: left" width="250">This 
		next section of Dr. Lyon's book deals with his Rotary experience in 
		1936.<br><br>Grandmother Richards takes over<br><br>In the spring of my 
		freshman year, as our Luisetti team took all the honors, my beloved 
		Grandmother Richards passed quietly away as her kidneys failed, the end 
		point of scarlet fever acquired in the waters of Sutro Baths near the 
		Golden Gate. She had been living with us for sometime. I had many talks 
		with her, for I was becoming a history buff. Her tales about the Old 
		South and the Civil War never tired me. Gram knew I had a dream, quite 
		impossible to achieve, of riding a bicycle through Europe, so far away 
		from home and family. Air travel was then restricted to pioneering Pan 
		American flying boats to Hawaii and South America. The telegraph was the 
		only reliable means of direct communication and not available 
		everywhere. So, dream on Dick, no charge, as you still have the Foreign 
		Service in your prospects.<br><br>Gram’s Will made this dream come true. 
		Ted and I were each to receive $800 that could only be spent riding 
		bicycles in Europe. There was no backing off from this commitment, and 
		there was a time frame dictating &quot;now.&quot; The year was 1936, and the 
		Olympics would be in Berlin.Lyon<br><br>Dad and Mom, faced with an 
		obligation that must be met, frightened of course, started to plan. Both 
		of them, always making something odious into something good, decided 
		that the $1,600 could be stretched to take us around the world. Dad 
		would make us into Rotary Ambassadors of Goodwill by enlisting the help 
		of Paul Harris, Founder of Rotary, that was by then in 57 countries, 
		many on our route. His letter assured our parents that their sons would 
		have helping hands when in need, and further, that two American young 
		men, whose teeth were cut on a Rotary Wheel, could strengthen the ties 
		that bind this organization. Dad sent the letter to the clubs in each 
		major city on our route. <br><br><br><br>We leave our home for eight 
		months to see the world <br><br>The hours riding in the bus to Seattle 
		were the only ones on the trip that were troubled by any apprehension. 
		The enormity of our undertaking was becoming obvious. By the time we 
		boarded the NYK Hiya Maru, our confidence had reestablished itself and 
		our days would be dedicated to planning ahead.<br><br>The trip in winter 
		in the subarctic seas was a rough one, our sturdy ship and equally 
		sturdy captain plunging along. The ten passengers made common sense of 
		using first class comforts, returning to second class for meals, there 
		chasing plates as they careened, some to the deck. No one was seasick. 
		There was really no time to sit in a deck chair with nothing to do 
		except respond to the environment.<br><br>Japan<br><br>Our Rotary 
		involvement began the day we landed in Yokohama. We were met and were 
		squired for three weeks in Japan from Tokyo to Kobe. We spoke to Tokyo 
		Rotary, had meals and nights in Japanese homes, and accompanied young 
		folk to Nikko in the awesome beauty of winter snow-decked Japanese 
		temples. We were taken to Hakone and Miyanoshita in the shadow of Mount 
		Fujiama, stayed at the fabled Tawaraya Riokan (native hotel) in Kyoto, 
		spent the night with the monks on Mount Koya San, and watched the 
		Takarazuka dancers in Kobe, their performance far surpassing anything we 
		had seen at home. In the hands of Rotarians we believed we were seeing 
		the Japanese world of the future. They were the highly educated, often 
		even royalty, as were Baron and Baroness Togo, dedicated to catching up 
		with the outside world first discovered in the 1880s as the Emperor 
		Mejii accepted Admiral Perry’s challenge. These days would have a 
		profound effect on my thinking when Japan would become the enemy just a 
		few years later. At Stanford, as we prepared for this great adventure, I 
		had taken a course in Japanese history and absorbed it to a degree that 
		my appreciation of its culture made Japan for me much more than just 
		beautiful mountains and seas. This tendency to always look forward and 
		prepare for what might occur would be a staple for my life.<br><br>China
		<br><br>The Suwa Maru picked us up at Osaka and steamed towards 
		Shanghai, where Rotary again took over. Fong Sec, the father of Rotary 
		in China and Dad’s friend, treated us to the most sumptuous meal we 
		would ever have. It was course after course of traditional and historic 
		delicacies that I doubt can be obtained today. We saw the real China in 
		the narrow alleys behind the burgeoning western world of the Bund. 
		Rotary there was in its infancy, lagging behind Japan.<br><br>Back on 
		the Suwa Maru, steaming to Hong Kong, Charlie Chaplin, his beautiful 
		companion Hedy Lamarr, and her chaperoning mother, made for a few hours 
		of talk. Charlie Chaplin proved to be an incisive thinker, belying his 
		character on the silver screen. <br><br>Rotary in Hong Kong was a 
		surprise. It still operated in the colonial tradition. There were no 
		Chinese members. We watched our words carefully. A side trip to Canton, 
		with its Ling Nan University and American friends there, took us into 
		the heart of old China. The individuality of the Cantonese left an 
		indelible impression that Canton was in an almost medieval state, more 
		like America in its earliest entrepreneurial days. China was far from 
		being cast in a single mold.<br><br>Philippines<br><br>On our side trip 
		to Manila, we were in the hands of family friends, the Judge Lockwoods. 
		They made sure we tasted of the always colorful flavors of brightly 
		painted taxis and rickshaws provided by a people seemingly content with 
		the primitive joys that were soon to change. Rotary was not our host at 
		this stop, and this again was the old colonial world. There were cool 
		mountain retreats for the rich and privileged. We, the latter, played a 
		round of golf in Baguio before going on board ship again, back to Hong 
		Hong to board our liner back to the west.<br><br>Singapore, Ceylon, 
		Aden, Suez<br><br>In Singapore, the Rotary President met us to be sure 
		our few hours ashore were well spent. The harbor was a mass of activity, 
		which included boys diving for coins beside the ship. Our colonial world 
		again took over as we had cold drinks and lunch at the fabled Raffles 
		Hotel. The city seemed as beautiful and disciplined as I understand it 
		is today. What do I remember most vividly? It was the tall handsome 
		Sikhs in magnificent tunics, hand directing traffic with a flick of a 
		finger, perhaps an arm wave at most, always unflappable.<br><br>It was a 
		short sail to Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. Rotary President Reverend Dr. 
		Nathanialez, met the ship and treated us to classic tropical fare as we 
		talked with his seven children, all with college scholarships waiting 
		for them in England. We’ll never forget the hot curry and the cold fruit 
		drinks that spoiled us forever. Curry today is not even a shadow of what 
		it was then. As we embarked, the Reverend presented to each of us a tiny 
		ebony elephant. It rests in front of me today as I remember and write.<br>
		<br>The rest of the sail took us through the Gulf of Aden and the Suez 
		Canal. In Port Said we had the opportunity to make a one-day side trip 
		to Egypt. Ted and I both felt that such a short visit was unconscionable 
		for a site so historic. We would take our chances that some day in the 
		future we would give Egypt the respect due it. And of course there was 
		the added matter of cost. Our dollars were too precious not to hoard 
		them for the biking days ahead<br><br>Marseilles<br><br>The 
		Mediterranean’s blue surrounded us the next days as we passed the 
		smoking Stromboli volcano, then made land on Easter morning, docking 
		sounds muted by the music of church bells heralding the day. It was 
		Sunday, and another holiday would follow. All of our only dollars were 
		in my money belt, as a Letter of Credit that could not be invaded until 
		banks would open. Mr. Shallam, old &quot;China Hand&quot; returning for a 
		well-deserved vacation in England, took his Masonry <br><br>French 
		Riviera first<br><br>Our first days biking over the hills to Toulon 
		started to toughen us up. At Le Lavendou, a tiny medieval hamlet on the 
		Mediterranean, we had our first taste of rain. In our beach-side 
		pension, after delicious meals, it was a treat to sit and read while 
		looking out on the turbulent sea. The ride then took us through even 
		older Hyères to Cannes and Nice. Did we stare at the scantily clad 
		beauties on the beaches? I don’t think so. We were still too busy being 
		absorbed into our own world of make believe.<br><br>We watched the Rolls 
		Royce's roll up to the Monte Carlo Casino. Somehow we talked the 
		concierge into letting us do our ogling at the tables, hands firmly in 
		our pockets as we planned for the intensive ride the next day. It would 
		be east on the Moyenne (Middle) Cornice, and then back on the high 
		altitude Grande Cornice with its tiny historic castle at Eze. We were 
		beginning to really roll. <br><br>The next day was Saturday, and we 
		would cycle into Italy. The border is a thousand feet above the city of 
		Menton. There we had our first experience with a border crossing, not 
		shared by bus loads of tourists flashing by. More lira? For a deposit on 
		our bikes? It’s Saturday and the banks are closed!<br><br>Ted stayed at 
		the station while I rode down into Menton. I somehow located the Black 
		Market, took a beating in the exchange, and pedaled back up. These two 
		now bedraggled American boys in shorts and T-shirts could pedal into 
		Italy, keeping out of the way of the roaring busses.<br><br>It’s Italy
		<br><br>Our first taste of Italy on this weekend was of red and yellow 
		flowers and a small square filled with old and young, loafing and 
		dancing as joy seemed to fill the air. This was a welcome change from 
		the sophisticated coolness of the French Riviera. It predicted wonderful 
		days ahead, especially when we were able for $10 apiece to procure 
		railroad seats taking us anywhere and everywhere in Italy. Mussolini was 
		rightly famed for his railroads, always on time, with baths (doccia) 
		available at every main station. A hot shower, soap and towels were 
		provided. Could we ask for anything more?<br><br>With bikes in the 
		baggage car everywhere we went, taken out and ridden for miles through 
		historic sites and wholesome countrysides, we kept our legs in 
		reasonable shape. However, our strength was no match for that of the 
		locals. Once we hit the cobblestones that ringed every city and provided 
		main streets in the hamlets, there would be friendly competition as 
		youths came up from behind, challenged us, went by, and then rode away 
		to their homes, always laughing and waving.<br><br>We were in the 
		catacombs outside Rome when the Harrison Flannerys, scions of an old 
		well-to-do family in Pittsburgh, asked us if we would like to go with 
		them to Naples and Pompeii in their new Ford convertible sedan. You 
		can’t beat that, and those were fun days. They stayed at the finest 
		hotels while we wandered through the byways, searching for a reasonable 
		and comfortable pension. They had their Baedeker to guide them, but we 
		had something better. It was called the Hand Me Down, made available by 
		Holland America Line. It was a paperback with recommendations for 
		hotels, restaurants with their prices and also special things to see, 
		all gathered from travelers over the many years. It was our Bible and 
		never let us down. So, our searches were always short and the results 
		superb.<br><br>Beyond the routine visits to Herculaneum and Pompeii, our 
		climb to the summit of a smoking and burning Vesuvius was truly “tops.” 
		I can still remember the guide beseeching us to not go any further, but 
		we did until the hot soles of our shoes said &quot;nuff.&quot; I am guessing our 
		visit to the active volcano may have been among the last, as Vesuvius 
		sleeps these days.<br><br>Il Duce appears and so do we <br><br>We 
		returned to Rome to find the excitement intense, for Il Duce was to 
		speak from his palace in Piazza Venezia. The war in Ethiopia had ended 
		with Italy the victor and now, with a major African colony, the Roman 
		Empire was reborn. All of the avenues entering the Piazza were packed; 
		there were a million people in front of the candlelit Vittorio Emanuele 
		II Monument.<br><br>Ted and I, head and shoulders above most of the 
		crowd, sort of slithered and slid forward until we were just a few of 
		feet away from Mussolini standing above on the portico. Il Duce was the 
		chant, even as he spoke, his hand always out in salute while Il Duce 
		small papers were scattered by planes close above. <br><br>Once he 
		disappeared behind the drapes, many near us seemed to be going somewhere 
		else. We followed to find ourselves in a jubilant parade, ending up at 
		the Quirinale, the King’s Palace, on top of one Rome's seven hills. 
		There was the king himself, Victor Emanuel, saluting the crowd. We 
		returned to our Pensione Juliana, two very tired boys.<br><br>What do I 
		remember most about Rome of 1936? The fountains and plazas lined with 
		colorful sidewalk cafes; the stillness and peace as we picnicked in the 
		grass and wildflowers lining the large cobblestones of the Appian Way; 
		the inner, fearful grandeur of the Coliseum as we conjured up gladiators 
		coming through the tunnels to fight to their deaths. That dream was 
		breached when we overstayed, finding ourselves locked in. Much yelling 
		brought the Carabinieri, who laughed at our confinement and didn’t take 
		us to jail for breaking the law. Bikes took us to Hadrian’s Villa, its 
		trees filled with the songs of birds, and the Villa d'Este in Tivoli, 
		magnificent in the night, as Mussolini prized its lighted pools and 
		falls. We threw our coins in the fountain of Trevi as we left to go 
		north, first to Assisi, and then to Florence, Venice, and Milan, finally 
		leaving the train well into the Alps at Iselle.<br><br>This hamlet was 
		really tiny–––just an equally tiny hotel over a rushing stream and a 
		train station. True to what we had been promised as we left our bikes at 
		the station in Florence, there they were, and ready to go again. Thanks 
		Benito.<br><br>We ride over the Simplon Pass––– the first that year<br>
		<br>Purely by chance and good luck we went through customs as the first 
		to go over the Simplon Pass that year. Again, we were at the mercy of 
		the agent, a swarthy unshaven character out of a Hollywood western who 
		played his part well as he smilingly cheated us as we exchanged lira for 
		francs. No matter, we were thrilled to be on our way through snow 
		tunnels, alternately walking and riding towards the 6,500 foot summit. 
		We miscalculated the availability of food. Our usual habit of buying 
		some vegetables and bread along the way was impossible, for habitations 
		were far away on the mountain slopes where cattle grazed, their tinkling 
		bells music to our ears.<br><br>It was the Benedictine Hospice that will 
		forever be engraved on our memories. The Saint Bernards met us. The 
		priest took us in, fed us, and sent us on our way. This was a fairy tale 
		made real. A few coins at the altar hardly covered the joy of that day.<br>
		<br>We were sure we were finally in Switzerland. There would be no more 
		haggling over each purchase, and blue-eyed, fair-haired country folk 
		would be our hosts. And the next ride would be downhill all of the way 
		to Brig, four thousand feet below. Riding at times with our feet on the 
		bars despite the gravel surface, our joy was brought to a halt as my 
		rear tire went flat. The pastures around were empty and silent, until, 
		from nowhere, our first Swiss friend appeared. Mountain dialects didn’t 
		allow any explanation. None were needed. He took out his kit, removed 
		the tire, patched it, and blew it up again, all in one motion, ending as 
		he took off with a smile and a wave. What a welcome to the land we had 
		dreamed of for so long! And, its mighty Matterhorn was just ahead.<br>
		<br>To see it meant a long walk, pushing bikes, on a narrow well-worn 
		mountain path. Cars were not allowed in Zermatt. We went through tiny 
		St. Nicholas, and along the meandering stream, wildflowers abounding. 
		Zermatt was just as anticipated, a fairy land. We gave no thought to 
		making a climb to the Matterhorn’s summit, for that would take days of 
		getting used to the altitude, so the magnificent mountain was just that 
		from afar. We had to be on our way again.<br><br>Then came the rain <br>
		<br>The Rhone River Valley was an easy coast downhill, we thought, until 
		the winds from Lake Geneva, sweeping so powerfully up the valley, made 
		us push in low gear for hours to make any headway. Rotary came to the 
		rescue in Geneva, placing us in our first hostel. There we learned the 
		virtues of &quot;café au lait,&quot; along with beer, to be a constant source of 
		energy for the rest of our journey.<br><br>Then the rains began. It was 
		only mid June. It poured and poured and poured! After four days of 
		waiting for respite, we purchased sorry raincoats––no parkas then––and 
		went on the road. The water went in at the collar and out over the 
		shoes. We had to keep riding to stay warm, not hard to do going uphill, 
		but a downhill run would chill us to the bone. After one such chill, I 
		spent the night in Ted’s arms, our blankets not effective. I must have 
		been in good shape to have tolerated this. <br><br>We rode on through 
		picturesque old Bern to Interlaken, still in the rain and denying us the 
		awe-inspiring views we had expected and believed we deserved. In 
		Interlaken the Rotary president, architect Niggli, put us in comfy, warm 
		beds. One day of sunshine let us climb up the valley and the three 
		thousand feet to Mürren (no money for the lift) to see the Jungfrau in 
		all of its grandeur. It, along with Zermatt’s Matterhorn, had to suffice 
		for Switzerland’s physical beauty. The beauty of its people did the 
		rest.<br><br>Our first real country hostel outside of Lucerne gave us a 
		taste of what was to follow. It was full, as was often the case, for 
		most travelers were on the road for a day or two and would stop early. 
		We would ride full days, up to 100 miles if pavements allowed, so we 
		often would check in late and accommodations were likely to be 
		makeshift. This night Ted and I slept on mats in the attic, but the view 
		through the bottle glass windows was compensation enough. <br><br>Swiss 
		roads were a joy, and bicycle paths were appearing. However, often we 
		would leave the highway, and push and ride up a side road to gain the 
		full flavor of the land and its people. It was on to Lucern, where our 
		main destination was the main park and its famous Lion of Lucerne. He 
		didn’t let us down. Then we were on to Zurich and our next Rotary 
		experience.<br><br>Zurich Rotary, to be followed by Munich Rotary, came 
		the closest to our American concept of a Club. Herr Turler, maker of 
		world recognized watches and Herr Sprungli, a world chocolate king, made 
		us feel at home at the meeting. Sprungli chocolates filled our packs 
		when we left. At dinner in Zurich’s finest restaurant we can never 
		forget the spit-barbecued lamb, again a Rotary gift. <br><br>The road to 
		Konstanz in Germany borders the Rhein. Its tiny town, Stein Am Rhein, 
		was and still is a gem not to be missed. Boy Scouts paraded as we came 
		by.<br><br>Our border crossing was easy for the first time. They 
		welcomed blond, blue-eyed Aryans, for they were expecting America to 
		join them in their misguided racial ventures, something we knew nothing 
		of at the time. Then our roadways changed, as paved bicycle paths became 
		common in the more traveled areas<br><br>On the bicycle paths and roads 
		of Germany <br><br>Munich Rotary was down to just 26 members from over 
		200 and glad to survive. As an international organization, only it and 
		the Red Cross were allowed. Rotary’s survival was special in that Herr 
		Oberhummer, proprietor of Munich’s largest department store, was one of 
		the original eight members providing Hitler’s original support in 
		Munich. I have wondered if his heart was broken in the years that 
		followed. In his store he made sure we purchased the correct apparel for 
		young men–––Bavarian plumed hat, hosentrager (suspenders) and lederhosen 
		(sturdy leather shorts), and only in fashion when well worn. Muncheners 
		rubbed butter into the leather to make it look well used. We chose 
		otherwise, because Bavarian manners might be unacceptable in the other 
		parts of Europe we would traverse. Germany’s Rotary, bleeding, was to 
		die slowly.<br><br>Riding from Augsburg to Nuremburg, we stopped at 
		Erlangen at its Siemens plant. Its Rotarian manager, Dr. d’Ernst, showed 
		us &quot;die werkes.&quot; Then on to the historic quaint old towns–––Rothenburg, 
		Dinkelsbuhl, Heidelberg, and at the Rhine, Hitler’s showcase hostel, 
		Stahleck Castle. Then it was cobblestones again along the Rhine to Bonn, 
		and a smooth highway to Koln where Hitler’s &quot;Jugend,&quot; (German youths, 
		boys and girls) were toughening up for what was to be their fate. <br>
		<br>This was a serious affair. In contrast to Mussolini’s Young 
		Fascisti, with their small and inconspicuous knives made of rubber, 
		large German Jugend knives in holsters seemed to mean business. We did 
		not warm up to our hostel neighbors. We were just glad to have a bed on 
		which to place our &quot;schlafsacks&quot; (envelope-like sheets), and to be 
		supplied with a blanket and a 10-pfennig breakfast of brot and milch 
		each day. We did not tap into Rotary again as we remained vigorous and 
		healthy, though tired, and felt the need to try and catch up with our 
		schedule that had been ruptured by the rains.<br><br>Herrsching is on 
		the Ammersee, and just a few miles south is Andechs Monastery where Herr 
		Oberhumer treated us to the wonderful beer you see here. That is Ted at 
		his best in 1936, also the location of RGHF's 11th anniversary, in 2011.

		<img class="auto-style26" src="lyonmunich.png" style="float: left">Holland
		<br>Our introduction to Holland was five days in the home of a family 
		whose “company town” spinning mill was something Ted and I had known 
		only in books. They seemed a happy lot. We slept in really soft beds. 
		Our meals we’ll always remember: breakfast meant eggs anyway we wished 
		them, with a variety of Dutch breads hard to imagine.<br><br>A word 
		about the designation &quot;Dutch.&quot; We quickly learned not to say &quot;Dutch.&quot; It 
		was too close to the German “Deutsch.” “Hollander” it would be from then 
		on.<br><br>Biking in Holland was a breeze. Hostels were all run 
		privately and with the feeling of a home. The highest hill was only 
		three hundred feet. Bicycle paths went everywhere, although we preferred 
		to ride on the dikes. We visited Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and then the 
		southern island of Walcheren, where the ferry deposited us in Belgium. 
		The crossing went almost unnoticed, so relaxed were the officials. The 
		ride down the poplar-lined canal to ancient Brugge was a high point for 
		us, but rain met us again on the road to Brussels. It was time to hurry 
		on toward Paris. We were running out of time as we anticipated the fall 
		semester at Stanford for both of us.<br><br>Paris <br><br>Paris was a 
		turning point. Monsieur Beranger, head of Standard Oil and a friend of a 
		friend, took us in. He gave us his guest room nine stories above his 
		opulent apartment on historic Rue de Lille. We breakfasted with him each 
		day. We were again, as in Holland, temporarily spoiled. He also made 
		preparations for me to fulfill my desire, at that moment, for a foreign 
		service career by enrolling me in the Ecole of Political and Social 
		Science, supposedly the finest preparatory school in the world. I could 
		enter it later on. Rotary again took us in, so to speak, assigning 
		Monsieur Franck to aid us. He spent a good deal of his time complaining 
		that his Coca Cola franchise was not paying off; the French loved their 
		wine. I hope he survived the war, as GI’s and their Cokes invaded.<br>
		<br>Dick gets the black flu in Paris and we race to England<br><br>Our 
		Paris visit ended when I started to run a high fever accompanied by 
		nausea. This was new, and we had no desire to be sick under French care. 
		We quickly sold our bikes for $5 apiece. I now think we should have 
		brought them home. We boarded the train to Calais, and then the ferry to 
		Dover, and finally the train to London where the London physician 
		Rotarian placed us in the Russell Square Hotel and made daily visits. By 
		that time Ted was feeling &quot;not so good,&quot; but fortunately good enough to 
		stay by my bedside as I became delirious. What is a delirium to me? It 
		is when brother Ted was &quot;there,&quot; for I could see him, but he wasn’t 
		really there. I doubt this will pass the test as an understandable 
		symptom of the &quot;Black Flu&quot; that was then starting a murderous toll on 
		the Continent. I guess we brought it to England. <br><br>There was one 
		major compensation. It was Henry Hyams, certified London Cockney, who by 
		definition had been born and lived within the range of Bow Bells Church. 
		Henry attached himself to us on the Dover ferry and never really left 
		our sides. He brought us food every day, and then introduced us to 
		Petticoat Lane. He taught us many of the cockney &quot;rhyming&quot; expressions 
		such as &quot;A Raspberry Tart,&quot; equivalent to our &quot;The Bird.&quot;<br><br>Forty 
		years later Henry would come to California, determined to see Indians. 
		The best we could do, despite driving him and his wife, Mona, the length 
		of the state, was to send him back to London as a cowboy, all five foot 
		two of him with hat, chaps, and boots, as he said, &quot;Hi pardner,&quot; passing 
		unchallenged through customs<br><br>We ship for home, at last<br><br>Our 
		three weeks of illness ended up in a luxurious country club with its 
		Rotary members. With returned appetites and wonderful meals and rest for 
		several days, enough time was left to see Windsor Castle and 
		Stratford-Upon-Avon, the wonders of Hyde Park, and the Tower of London, 
		before shipping out on the Cunard steamship Berengaria for home. Our 
		status was just above &quot;steerage,&quot; but as was our experience during the 
		whole trip, we were with the folks who really made the world turn. <br>
		<br>When New York loomed on the horizon, at the bow Ted and I were in 
		tears. We reminisced, and agreed that coming home to America, its 
		people, its freedoms, and its optimism was a gift unknown anywhere else. 
		But there is a price, for as we spread our largess, we cannot expect to 
		be loved or even liked by those who are the receivers. Therefore, in 
		order to be concerned for others and generous, we must above all be 
		powerful and never feel guilty because of it.<br><br>Knowing how our dad 
		operates, we expected him to be on the dock to greet us and take us 
		home. In that day, Dad would have had to make the five-day train trip to 
		New York. We looked at the crowds below, and no Dad. Oh hum, what’s new? 
		We’d make do and somehow find our way home with the few dollars left. 
		Bulky suitcases in hand, we went down the gangplank and started for the 
		street. As we passed the welcomers at First Class, there was Dad. He 
		always expected the best for his sons. In a few minutes we were gorging 
		on milkshakes at Walgreen's Drugs. <br><br>Dad purchased a used Buick, 
		one of the most powerful ever built, and we roared home. There we put 
		pounds on fast, and recovered the strength that would enable Ted to be a 
		freshman basketball star, and cushion my fanny to sit comfortably on the 
		bench. I had lost the opportunity to stay on the first string while we 
		were learning about the rest of the world. Regrets? Not a bit. As I look 
		back today, I have the same admonitions we expressed on the bow of the 
		Cunard liner Berengaria for the young who must carry on. <br><br><br>
		<br>CHAPTER 4 <br><br><br><br>STANFORD AGAIN <br><br><br><br>It is 
		Stanford for both of us<br><br><br><br>Ted and I had just returned home 
		to start our next semesters, Ted’s first at Stanford. The qualities I 
		seem to have manifested up to this time were: <br><br>1. To do the best 
		I can everyday in a way that I am content within myself. <br><br>2. To 
		not set professional goals as prods to achievement. Take each day one at 
		a time, keeping the doors open to the future by all-around preparation 
		for a lifetime’s work that is within my potential. Thus, a career in 
		music and art are not a consideration. My tinkering talents and comfort 
		with the common sense math of algebra and interest in the outside world 
		are ready to be used. The goal of inner satisfaction is never lost. Was 
		it not strange that practicing medicine had never really occurred to me?<br>
		<br><br><br>Basketball <br><br><br><br>Like rugby in the destiny of 
		Nelson Mandela, basketball was a major giveaway as to values already 
		manifest that would guide me throughout my lifetime. They are not 
		special, but they did not include having to win and in the process be 
		sure others lose. At times I seem like a wimp. Let me say to others with 
		like tendencies, &quot;You are not a wimp either.&quot; In fact you are quite the 
		opposite. You don’t have to throw a punch to be a man, as Bill O’Reilly 
		suggests. You just have to duck as you grab the hand and make a friend.&quot; 
		Let’s see how this went over the next four years for this non-combative 
		guy whose contest lay hidden within. Was it hard to hold back? 
		Absolutely not. It was just plain &quot;natural.&quot; My first mentors, Mom and 
		Dad, had taught me well.<br><br>The chance to play first string with 
		Hank Luisetti was clearly gone. Coach John Bunn had utter faith in the 
		team he had formed and rarely substituted, even when someone was clearly 
		&quot;dogging it.&quot; This was never true for Hank, who gave of himself to the 
		last whistle. So I toughened my fanny and accepted my role as second 
		stringer. Other fine players, feeling slighted, turned in their suits, 
		but not Dick. It was my intent, and thus a joy, just to be on the court 
		with this man five practice days a week, and at training table each 
		night. I treasured the banter with this group of superb athletes. Did I 
		have to win? I was winning every moment by my standards. I didn’t make 
		the travel team the first year, but did the second, as Hank demolished 
		vaunted Long Island University for the second time and put our western 
		cow college on the map more effectively than did a string of Nobel Prize 
		Laureates. Just a few minutes of playing time against CCNY has been my 
		treasured memory as I have milked the joy out of every moment, a habit 
		ingrained for life.<br><br>An incident that occurred at the start of my 
		second year is revealing to me as I look back. Because of my ability to 
		swim butterfly as well as do the standard breast stroke, with two others 
		we broke the Pacific Coast Medley Relay record. But swimming was just 
		plain &quot;no fun&quot; for me. Practice laps were so alone and boring, and my 
		swimming muscles, painfully acquired as my tight basketball muscles were 
		untangled, left me with a discoordination that prevented me from 
		swinging a golf club or tennis club effectively. That was too high a 
		price, for golf with Dad and my brothers still had priority.<br><br>
		Swimming coach Nort Thornton asked Hank if I would make the team. Hank, 
		to my surprise, said, “I don’t think so.” Nort then came to me to report 
		this, and to recruit me as a goalie on the water polo team. The frog 
		kick of the breast stroke allows a goalie to be pushed high in the net. 
		&quot;Nort,&quot; I said, &quot;You have just made a mistake. I will make the team.&quot; 
		And I did, and did not swim again in my final year. <br><br>Of course I 
		had to help win in any team play, whether basketball, rugby, or tennis 
		doubles, but &quot;having to win&quot; in no way competed with &quot;playing a great 
		game&quot; that brought the best out of my adversaries, as they often won, 
		while I was at peace with myself.<br><br><br><br>My hernia vs. my 
		basketball season<br><br><br><br>In February of my sophomore year I 
		noticed a little bulge in my right groin. I panicked, got in the car, 
		drove up to see Uncle Bert Meads about the problem. He didn’t exactly 
		laugh, but said, &quot;It is just a hernia, and I can fix that.&quot; &quot;Not now, 
		please,&quot; was my rejoinder. We agreed to fix it in the summer, but I had 
		to get by in the meantime.<br><br>Of course a hernia sounds like 
		something awful to a young kid. Uncle Bert said he would keep it a 
		secret. I said I would do what I could not to get kicked off the team by 
		Doc Northway, who seemed to know everything about his charges. <br><br>
		How to get by with this? By then I had appreciated that if you weren’t 
		self-conscious or looking embarrassed and in this way directing 
		attention to yourself, your imperfections might go unnoticed. Just play 
		it straight. I reasoned that a second supporter, or jock strap, pulled 
		tightly into the groin as a truss would do the job. At the least it 
		deserved a try. As it turned out, I was not aware of the hernia at any 
		time, even with intense play. <br><br>Each day in the dressing room and 
		in front of all my teammates, I put on two jockstraps, while looking 
		directly at them. Can you believe it? No one ever noticed, let alone 
		commented. I played out the season.<br><br>The lesson? If you don’t 
		point out your self-perceived deformities or shortcomings to others, 
		you’re likely to carry the day. It’s all in the light of your eye.<br>
		<br>The hernia repair was a cinch, as I would find out on making 
		hundreds of these repairs in the young later on. But how different our 
		concepts were then as to aftercare. I, healthy and strong, was kept in 
		bed for 10 days in the hospital. When told to get up, I fell flat on my 
		face on the floor, so weak were my muscles and balance. Not the way to 
		go. Once a surgeon, my rule would be to get patients on their feet 
		almost immediately, no matter how serious the surgery. They didn’t need 
		to know my history and thus my reason to make such a demand. <br><br>
		There’s a little more to the story. I was told to go home and rest. Are 
		you kidding? I felt fine and believed I knew how not to strain my 
		operative site. I got in the car and drove up to The Cedars in the 
		mountains. The next day I went down the river a mile or so to the Big 
		Pool. I had the Contax camera on my back. I cast my line, slipped, and 
		looked down about 50’ to the pool, as a strong little tree went by 
		untouched as I slid. Why &quot;untouched?&quot; A sudden jolt could undo the 
		sutures. Better to go into the pool, camera and all, staying completely 
		relaxed. It worked, and I climbed out and started home, anxious to start 
		drying out the camera.<br><br>Half way up I met the rescue party, a 
		member with a past hernia repair leading the pack. We sped home 
		together, I none the worse for wear. After all I had had a superior 
		surgeon do the job. At dinner that evening, this member told me that he 
		had to have a second repair, because he had driven his car too early. I 
		reached down and all seemed well. I drove home unscathed. My hernia 
		repair survived strenuous days on the basketball court and rugby field. 
		Sure got my money’s worth, Uncle Bert.<br><br><br><br>Fraternity life<br>
		<br><br><br>Stanford life in that day centered on the fraternities and 
		sororities. In them were the majority of movers and shakers. My House, 
		Zeta Psi, stood by itself on the road leading to the residence of Ray 
		Lyman Wilbur, Stanford’s President. He was a towering personality within 
		and without. As Secretary of the Interior under President Herbert 
		Hoover, he had been able to provide protection to The Cedars, an enclave 
		near Donner in the Sierras. It had been owned by Mark Hopkins as part of 
		the ten-mile square blocks of land earned as the trancontinental 
		railroad was cut through the mountains in 1868.<br><br>I suspect that 
		Zeta Psi, if history notices it, will have a special place. It housed, 
		in my time, five All American football players, two student body 
		presidents, every other member a major sport letterman, and at least 
		three Phi Beta Kappas, all in my class. And I was one of these. We were 
		the campus &quot;roughs.&quot; Our daily attire was jeans. We were in no way &quot;High 
		Society&quot; and were in stark contrast to our major rivals, at least for 
		coed affections, the Dekes. Their &quot;bow ties and tails&quot; routinely graced 
		San Francisco soirees. Dr. Wilbur would wave to his &quot;roughs&quot; as he went 
		home each day.<br><br>To me, what set Zeta Psi apart was that these boys 
		were already men. Hazing and traumatic initiations ruled fraternities. 
		The Zeta Psi fraternity had no time for such trivia. I saw a paddle used 
		just once, when a spoiled son of a Hollywood mogul was absent routinely 
		from his Saturday housework, despite many warnings. The paddle had to be 
		used, and only the smallest man in the House agreed to wield it. It 
		worked, as it was supposed to on any immature &quot;boy.&quot;<br><br>Initiation 
		was a chore for all. It amounted to one’s sitting on a hard chair 
		throughout Saturday, enduring only the fierce halitosis of an older Zete 
		close up as he told of the Zeta Psi history at length. And this was the 
		house that was termed &quot;The Zoo&quot; by others on The Row!<br><br>There were 
		of course pranks as part of those carefree days before Pearl Harbor; the 
		War would thin our numbers by at least three. Perhaps the most 
		illustrious prank took place the night when Red Fay and Don Williams, 
		anticipating a win for our Stanford Clark Shaugnessy-coached team, with 
		hack saws weakened the new &quot;impregnable&quot; iron goal posts in Cal 
		Berkeley’s Memorial Stadium. After the win the next day, and with five 
		Zetes on the team, the goal posts were felled as the &quot;brothers&quot; gave it 
		a push. <br><br>On our return from the travels of 1936, Ted became a 
		Zete and was dubbed as &quot;Polo,&quot; as I became &quot;Marco.&quot; That fraternity 
		nickname has followed me the rest of my life. &quot;Hey, Marco&quot; tells me that 
		a Zete buddy is hailing me, and warm memories flood. As my four and a 
		half years of college ended, a decision was demanded. I had followed my 
		intent to &quot;keep all of the doors open.&quot; Boalt Hall School of Law in 
		Berkeley had accepted my application. I had a scholarship waiting at MIT 
		in Aeronautical Engineering, made possible by a wealthy MIT supporter, 
		also Dad’s dear friend. Business School was not an option, for it didn’t 
		exist. Harold Bacon, a mentor, had seen to it that I was admitted to Phi 
		Beta Kappa. He had broken all the rules, for Engineering was not then an 
		acceptable &quot;Humanities&quot; major. My guess is that I could easily have 
		ended up at Boalt Hall, preparing for work in international law as I 
		retained my desire to see more of the world and its peoples.<br><br><br>
		<br>My greatest decision, obvious, but hidden from the start<br><br><br>
		<br>Bill Hawkins, dear friend and Student Body President, and I were 
		talking about our futures when I exclaimed, &quot;Bill, I am so proud of you 
		for your becoming a doctor.&quot; A few seconds passed. I said, &quot;I am going 
		to medical school too.&quot; That was it. No hesitation. Why? <br><br>It was 
		obvious that the years of experimenting and perhaps denying were over. 
		My fears of the demands of dedication and confinement had to be overcome 
		or perhaps, more to the point, accepted. Everything I had studied, in a 
		roundabout way, was really preparation to meet a single end.<br><br>I 
		had to believe that each day I would be doing something for someone and 
		be assured of satisfying, tangible results. At the same time, 
		accumulation of wealth was not my wish. Service as a doctor would 
		hopefully be rewarded with an income sufficient to meet family needs yet 
		to be defined. <br><br><br><br>A revealing Pre-med year at UC Berkeley<br>
		<br><br><br>The die was instantly cast. The family tradition of not 
		dallying over a decision prevailed. I had to spend a year in Pre-med, 
		hoping the thought processes honed in Engineering would be an asset. 
		They would be that for sure, but in a way I did not imagine.<br><br>The 
		year of Pre-med at Berkeley was an eye opener. It was the first time 
		since high school that I became conscious of the &quot;Quick Memory&quot; minds. 
		This time, though, the contest was for keeps. I had taken Biology in my 
		freshman year at Stanford, but had not the time to do more than use what 
		quick memory I had available to get by. My opening course in Embryology 
		with Dr. Long, known as a dour martinet, left no doubt I was in for an 
		intensive year. My Phi Beta Kappa key was just a memory as I kept it 
		well out of sight and wondered what I had gotten into. When I heard the 
		term &quot;epididymis,&quot; which would be a mainstay of my eventual specialty, 
		urology, I had to look at my neighbor’s lucid notes just to spell it. 
		One thousand aspirants filled the lecture room. Nowhere was the 
		intensity of competition more evident than in the lab, as students hid 
		their findings in the microscope as though sharing was out of the 
		question. It was the night before the final when I finally recognized 
		what a &quot;somite&quot; (developing vertebra) was. I barely got through with a D 
		as I relearned the prerequisite biology long forgotten, to then be 
		amplified into embryology. This was a different world I was sampling.
		<br><br>My professor of Organic Chemistry was just as cold and 
		suspicious. When I asked him for a little help, I was accused of 
		&quot;buttering&quot; him up. All was not lost, though, for I found a human being 
		in Dr. Aitken, who taught Advanced Biology. He was a born teacher and 
		told me of his love to encourage the minds going into medicine. That was 
		his calling, yet the powers that be required his next two years in 
		narrow, isolated research. <br><br>I counted this counsel a blessing. 
		Dr. Nafzigger, a member of the Cedars and the powerful University of 
		California Professor of Neurosugery, was pleased at my decision and 
		started planning how to eventually have me as a resident. But, I had 
		another concern: my decision to be a doctor had, at the least, to have a 
		happy beginning. The bookworms I had been exposed to left me cold. 
		Familiar Stanford offered my best hope. Although I am sure my pre-med 
		grades didn’t pass the test, my varied career there and a personal 
		interview with perhaps the wisest man I have ever known, Stanford’s Dean 
		George Barnett, turned the tide. I would be Stanford’s first 
		engineer-doctor in a long time. My education in real life was just 
		beginning.<br><br>My doors would now be open to internship and residency 
		in a specialty I would eventually choose. I would be letting the cards 
		fall where they may until then. Again, if I filled every day, the future 
		would open wide.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 5<br><br><br><br>BLUE BEAUTY<br>
		<br><br><br><a href="Blue&#32;Beauty259&#32;1.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="181" src="Blue&#32;Beauty259&#32;1.jpg" style="float: left" width="250"></a>Blue 
		Beauty makes transition from engineer to doctor a pleasure<br><br><br>
		<br>One of the books I loved most as a boy told the story of a black 
		stallion known as Black Beauty. Thus it was a natural for another story 
		to really take place.<br><br>I had just decided to 
		become a doctor, and not an engineer after all. This change required I 
		that add another year of education to cover pre-medical studies. It was 
		least expensively<br><br>achieved at UC Berkeley, just a few miles away 
		from our home in Happy Valley. Wheels were a necessity for the first 
		time. Somehow I had sequestered $600 doing odd jobs at Stanford and 
		during the winter vacation scrambling up stairs with Christmas loads for 
		the Postal Service. Why not look at used car lots and make a good 
		choice?<br><br>I started my search in 1939 by approaching the Buick 
		used-car department in the premier agency in San Francisco. I was 
		standing in the shop when a deep blue Buick Roadmaster convertible sedan 
		rolled in. I assumed that it was there for repairs. Admiringly, I 
		inquired as to its year and horsepower. The foreman said, &quot;I am not 
		sure. It’s here just as a trade in.&quot;<br><br>I asked, &quot;What do you want 
		for it?&quot; <br><br>&quot;$600.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I’ll take it!&quot; I hastily wrote out the 
		check, jumped in the seat, and started the engine. <br><br>&quot;But we 
		haven’t checked it out and serviced it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Just fine. I’ll drive 
		it out as is.&quot; I was taking no chances that someone else might see the 
		gem I had discovered and slip away with it. Blue Beauty had black 
		leather seats, the slickest and most comfortable l had ever seen, and 
		the power that made just ordinary driving a ride in a chauffeured 
		limousine.<br><br>It quickly became the convertible sedan of choice in 
		Berkeley, always in place in the parking lot, ready to go as I lunched 
		at the Zeta Psi fraternity house. Its chariot’s duties extended to being 
		mobilized, with me as chauffeur, to make rounds at other 
		fraternities–––Dekes most often–––as the parties wore down. Blue Beauty 
		and I would pick up beautiful dates of incapacitated, somnolent Zete 
		brothers, then to deliver the ladies to the safety of their sorority 
		abodes. I guess my nick name, “The Sultan,” was earned and well 
		deserved; I was just a darned trustworthy guy as a driver and perhaps a 
		father figure. But what else could one expect of a brother Zete from 
		Stanford? And when it came time for the Spring parade with its King and 
		Queen, Blue Beauty was the chosen chariot, now spoiled by its garland of 
		flowers.<br><br>Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay had just been 
		created, and the 1939-1940 World’s Fair would dedicate it. Many 
		industries would be represented there and just as many entertainment 
		venues. I was first attracted to Esther Williams and her Aquacade. They 
		had advertised for swimmers proficient in freestyle and backstroke, and 
		breast strokers who also &quot;fly.&quot; It was a natural for me, having been a 
		member of Stanford's record-setting medley threesome. A buddy, a 
		champion swimmer on the UC team, who possessed one of the most beautiful 
		freestyle strokes I had ever seen, joined me. We two went to the 
		Fairmont Hotel's inside pool for tryouts. As I remember, we were a 
		little put off by the appearances of swimmers competing with us––these 
		weren’t college kids. They looked like older pros, probably mobilized 
		from Hollywood itself or recruited from lifeguards on Southern 
		California beaches. However, if ability was to be the determinant, 
		neither of us felt threatened.<br><br>Several hours later, all of the 
		swimmers lined up in the Civic Auditorium, there to be examined by the 
		old master himself, tiny Billy Rose. He came down the line, looking up 
		at these big specimens, accompanied by his secretary, tally board in 
		hand. Mr. Rose, moving briskly, stopped directly in front of the two of 
		us. My swimmer friend was also 6’3”, and as handsome as they come. Billy 
		looked at the two us as if surprised, perhaps, by unfamiliar faces. He 
		turned to his secretary. &quot;What about these two?&quot; It took just a &quot;no no&quot; 
		twist of his head to ding us. Our summer careers in an exotic enterprise 
		had ended.<br><br>Then I learned that Ford Motor Company was testing 
		applicants as lecturers for their exhibit almost across the street from 
		the Esther Williams water show. I don’t recall how many of us appeared 
		to be put through the traces of public speaking, but two of us were 
		chosen. Morrie Chase, handsome, tall and spare, with a lively 
		countenance and manner, and I were the lucky ones. I found myself the 
		lead speaker, guiding visitors every thirty minutes through a delightful 
		line of old carriages, some that had belonged to the legendary San 
		Francisco Gold Rush era barons such as Charles Crocker and Leland 
		Stanford. For once I found memorization not a chore, because these 
		vehicles were real. Carriages and stories blended together. I had the 
		freedom to speak as the spirit directed. On many occasions a listener 
		would point out a juicy tidbit dating back to the days when they had 
		seen these treasures roll by. <br><br>Morrie and I somehow acquired each 
		other’s talks, I guess just from listening to each other so many times 
		as we followed along with the visitors, and we would improve both 
		presentations. We were surely different in so many ways, but had in 
		common the desire to do our jobs well, our senses of humor overlapping. 
		Morrie was on his way to being a Catholic priest. He must have been a 
		wonder, so well prepared at the altar of the Ford exhibit. <br><br>Blue 
		Beauty, always ready to go, carried us workers back and forth each day 
		to man the Ford Exhibit on Treasure Island. We would direct her across 
		the Bay Bridge, top down on these summer days, even as we pierced the 
		morning fog, hair blowing in the sea breezes as we anticipated another 
		day doing a delightful job. We felt a little smug as we looked across 
		the way to the Aquacade, feeling sorry for the poor souls mechanically 
		paddling above and below the waves, not having time to blow noses on 
		handkerchiefs as their physical resistance broke down.<br><br>It became 
		time to start medical school at Stanford. The car gave me away. I was 
		obviously the wealthy son of a wealthy father named Harvey Lyon, the man 
		with the warehouse and the vans that said,. &quot;Let Lyon Guard Your Goods.&quot; 
		They were wrong about the wealth, b ut I had it coming to me. Yet. 
		explaining was not my style, and my buddies were happy to pile in, top 
		always down, as we raced late for class. At times the course took us off 
		the roads and across weedy fields. Blue Beauty absorbed the bumps 
		without a whimper.<br><br>Pearl Harbor happened as we finished our first 
		year on the Stanford campus. Our next years were spent in San Francisco. 
		With the onset of real war, we had all become Navy or Army ensigns and 
		GI’s, and in uniform. I chose the Navy, having been already prepared by 
		experiences with naval aviator Uncle Tom. He had been the Executive 
		Officer of the Langley, our pioneering aircraft carrier–––an old navy 
		collier transformed by a deck that became a landing pad. I also 
		envisioned a berth with shower heads close by, no matter the battle. 
		What an illusion that was, although in the Marine Corps shower heads 
		would be provided when not in combat on the beach.<br><br>Blue Beauty 
		had to be slowed to a walk, for gas rationing was severe. Horsepower was 
		now used to attend classes, infrequent trips home across the Bay, and 
		occasion dates. Gasoline was such a luxury that after graduation and my 
		assignment to Boston, Black Beauty had to be garaged in its &quot;stall&quot; in 
		Hidden Valley. And then for a brief few days between my Boston 
		internship and Marine induction at Parris Island in Virginia, we had a 
		few runs together, old Blue just as sprightly as ever.<br><br>The Bombs 
		at Hiroshima and Nagasaki ended the war. I was in the process of 
		clambering up the rope ladder to the APA, attack personnel transport, 
		that would have taken us through murderous kamikazes and landed us on 
		the beach of Kyushu, and had been given the sure reprieve of life. <br>
		<br>At the Naval Supply Depot in Alameda after the war, I continued my 
		life as a battalion surgeon. With gas rationing no longer, Blue Beauty 
		would spring to life and we would smoothly &quot;single-foot&quot; 
		together––skiing, dating, and just humming along under sunny California 
		skies.<br><br>Blue Beauty deserved to have its own pasture after such 
		noble service. This meant going into storage, placed on blocks, there to 
		grow arthritic with rust while it waited to become a &quot;classic car,&quot; a 
		designation quite unknown in those days. I could not allow this. My 
		Chief Petty Officer fell in love with Blue, and so it became his. <br>
		<br>We all have certain dogs, cats, or horses close to our hearts and 
		with life expectancies far short of ours. Blue Beauty’s lifetime could 
		match ours, but only with continuous loving care. I go to automobile 
		shows looking for her. Her lines would be unmistakable. When I do come 
		on a 1936 Buick Roadmaster Convertible Cabriolet, it is my Blue Beauty 
		every time. I imagine Blue Beauty saying &quot;Hi there. Those days we can’t 
		forget.&quot;<br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 6<br><br><br>
		<br>MEDICAL SCHOOL<br><br><br><br>I become a Stanford medical student<br>
		<br><br><br>From the first day, my classmates seemed so accomplished as 
		they told me of their activities, their records giving them an aura that 
		was impressive. But we would see. I understood hard work. My engineer’s 
		mind could recognize and unearth, then retain, facts and principles that 
		would hang together. Thus, Anatomy, Neurology, and Physiology were joys 
		as I traced and imbedded tracks, switches, and stations in my Process 
		Mind for instant recall when a problem presented. The quick memorizers 
		were neatly filing them in separate folders.<br><br>All in all my 
		starting grades were mediocre as I committed to memory Bacteriology and 
		Chemistry. When we moved to Stanford Hospital for our clinical years, I 
		began to feel the confidence in Process Thinking as the art of a 
		meaningful history was mastered while hands probed for telltale signs, 
		and laboratory results were factored in. I was at home, and, for the 
		first time, fell under the spell of the wisdom in which I was being 
		immersed.<br><br>Thomas Addis, who would be my Stanford mentor in my 
		education about the kidney, reminded me of the High Lama in Lost 
		Horizon, as his foresight would not limit diagnostic powers just to 
		initial treatment. With his hands in front pockets of his long white 
		smock, we spent delightful hours together, my ears taking in every word. 
		Speaking of mentors, he was top of the line. He was concerned about the 
		long haul, and was almost the first to what we now call &quot;follow up&quot; his 
		patients. Dad had schooled me well in this rule for constructive living. 
		Others had &quot;impressions.&quot; Not Dr. Addis. He kept meticulous records, 
		setting a standard I would easily follow. He had reduced tests to a 
		simplicity that allowed me, now his student assistant, to within a half 
		hour of taking my patient's history, complete the work up, and establish 
		the diagnosis. He left no doubt that diagnosis follows facts, a dictum 
		Dr. Frank Hinman would later affirm. His Creatinine Clearance is the 
		standard even today, although the joy of promptly making a diagnosis and 
		starting treatment has been lost, as these tests must go now to the 
		hospital lab, impersonal, and delaying treatment.<br><br>Yet something 
		else set him apart. The completely honest scientist–––his animal studies 
		proved that–––contrary to the current practice, established that a high 
		protein diet was not necessary to make up for the protein lost in the 
		urine of kidney disease. His low protein diet is still a staple, 
		although others claim credit. Did he take notice? I think not. His 
		humility may have been a hindrance to fame, but he knew that he was 
		being &quot;effective.&quot; I suspect I am one of his products, for that lesson 
		was not lost on me.<br><br><br><br>Our San Francisco boarding house<br>
		<br><br><br>After eighteen months of training in the basic sciences on 
		the Stanford campus, we moved to San Francisco for our clinical years. 
		My years in San Francisco were not unlike the story of the students at 
		Johns Hopkins who came to life in a boarding house run by Susie 
		Schlegal. Eight of us would sit around a table, white table cloth 
		always, at a sumptuous dinner each week night. Our two elderly hostesses 
		and cooks had raised families, come to the big city, rented this old 
		Victorian, and we showed up. The banter would start, and look out! All 
		of us had had our fill of fraternity life, but the give and take of 
		happy banter was ingrained. Sherm Mellinkoff, later to be dean at UCLA, 
		Brandy Bassett, to be a urologist in Oakland, and John Peal, headed for 
		Professor of Pediatrics at UC, would be the aggressors as the rest of 
		us, especially Jim Wilson and Dick, would try to keep up with the smooth 
		talkers. We were all in uniform, tuitions now paid for, preparing for 
		active duty after internships, but the war was still far away at the 
		time.<br><br>In teaching ward rounds, I was known as the guy who asked 
		&quot;the dumb questions,&quot; all in good humor. My Process Mind had to 
		understand to remember, but there turned out to be a positive side. Joe 
		Oyster and I were walking away from a makeshift graduation ceremony when 
		I said, &quot;Joe, it has been so much fun to be with you, even though you 
		are the number one man in the class. Your photographic memory has 
		produced so many laughs when you tie up our hopeless psychiatry 
		professor by repeating word for word the gobbledygook paragraph you read 
		to us the night before.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dick, let me explain. It isn’t what you 
		think. My photographic mind has been a terrible load to bear. I have 
		never learned to think. I will be a good doctor. You will be something 
		else.&quot; At the time I didn’t get the point. Perhaps he was &quot;prophetic.&quot; 
		It was then I realized that possibly my plodding and straining to 
		understand could stand me in good stead after all.<br><br><br><br>

		“breakaway” at Stanford as well as being a medical student <br><br>When 
		I returned to Stanford, my pre-med experience at Berkeley had allowed me 
		to be introduced to rugby, and “breakaway” was a natural fit for a 
		basketball player. I played second string at UC Berkeley, and somehow 
		scored the six points for a win against my Alma Mater. Rugby is a 
		non-letter sport, and any student, graduate or not, could play. <br><br>
		Back at Stanford in medical school, I went out for the team. A fine 
		breakaway and good friend, Ted Cole was injured. I was given his first 
		string job and stayed there. I played with the football greats, 
		All-American mountainous fullback Norm Standlee, scatback and 
		All-American Pete Kemetovick, and Frankie Albert, All-American 
		quarterback. As &quot;safety&quot; he was still phenomenal, demonstrating the same 
		talents in rugby as on the football field. We won all of our games, but 
		I will never forget USC, whose footballers played rugby too, and like 
		the blundering tough guys they were. Their attitude was &quot;to heck with 
		the rules&quot; and &quot;even if we could understand them, we’ll just roll over 
		you.&quot; That worked for the first half. I and the other Stanfords wondered 
		if we could take the clumsy beating for another half. Well, they were 
		more exhausted than we, and our knowledge of the game allowed us to roll 
		easily over them, making 21 points in the second half. <br><br>In 
		medical school, which continued in the clinics in San Francisco, I again 
		played rugby for the Olympic Club in San Francisco. In our game with 
		Cal, I found myself in the line-out battling a guy who was younger, 
		bigger, and much stronger. I realized he was using hands and elbows on 
		me where really just moving hips is enough, as in basketball, to keep 
		the other guy off balance. At any rate, I finally said to him, &quot;You’re 
		playing dirty and I don’t like it.&quot; California coach Doc Hudson benched 
		him for his actions.<br><br>Three years later, as I ran the urology 
		clinic as resident, who did I see as my student, now in a white coat, 
		but Peterson. I asked him if he remembered me, because I remembered him 
		as the dirtiest rugby player I knew of. He did. I asked him why he 
		didn’t take a swing at me that day. <br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; said Peterson, &quot;I am 
		not taking a swing at the Pacific Coast Boxing Champion.&quot; Smart boy! But 
		what he didn’t know, and still doesn’t, is that in my class at Stanford 
		there was another Dick Lyon. He was a Deke, who at 110 pounds, was the 
		Flyweight Pacific Coast Conference champion. <br><br>So, that was a 
		positive fallout from the name Lyon. It balanced Dad’s experience with 
		his name that cost him a scholarship for me to get through college. On 
		the other hand, I knew &quot;honesty is the best policy,&quot; but in this case I 
		turned honesty a little on its head, figuring Peterson was content with 
		his excellent judgment. Why spoil that?<br><br>Next to basketball, rugby 
		is the queen of competitive contact team sports, because it is played 
		without protection. There is no blocking or direct tackling, save going 
		for the ball. It is rough, but the kind of roughness enjoyable to one 
		such as myself whose contact is rarely direct, but slanting as you throw 
		each other off balance. Some of the most beautiful open field running is 
		possible. I remember the Irish playing Cal, and after a scoreless and 
		gentlemanly first half, Dr. Kyle, physician and their All-Irish hero, 
		simply took the ball on three runs the length of the field, scoring each 
		time as he left his defenders astonished, in broken-field runs that put 
		our football abilities to shame, and all in good spirit that typified 
		the sport. Nelson Mandela will attest to all of this. <br><br><br><br>
		Olympic club hypoxia––a learning process<br><br><br><br>One afternoon it 
		was so quiet at the Olympic Club that I decided to take a swim all by 
		myself. I had been given a scholarship there to play basketball and 
		rugby. No one was around, and the Olympic-sized pool, 50 yards long, 
		needed some action. I had thoroughly enjoyed my basic Physiology class 
		in medical school, and often wondered about the process of re-breathing, 
		the intent to empty the lungs of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the 
		actual stimulus to take a breath rather than just a shortage of oxygen. 
		I knew that pearl divers did this, so why not give it a try? <br><br>So, 
		rebreathing aggressively, I dove in. It was my intent to go as far as 
		possible without surfacing, my breast stroke being so effective. I swam 
		the first fifty yards and made the turn starting back. At 75 yards, I 
		felt as though I could go on forever, still not needing to take a 
		breath. This was at least twice as far and twice as long under water as 
		I had ever experienced. Then common sense chimed in. I realized that 
		something was wrong. It was almost a panic. I came to the surface not a 
		bit out of breath but alive! And if I hadn’t come up, who knows? 
		Sometime later I read of a young man on the same jaunt found dead at the 
		bottom of the pool, and that possibility was quite real that day for me, 
		as I had experienced a kind of fatal euphoria. I am told that such is 
		not uncommon among deep sea divers. <br><br>The lesson? Keep thinking, 
		no matter the momentary happiness, in anything you do. I don’t recall my 
		teacher ever mentioning if hypoxia (low oxygen) would kick in in time to 
		save one’s life. Apparently not, but I was allowed to keep filling my 
		responsibilities ahead whatever they might be. A very, very close call!
		<br><br><br><br>Learning clinical medicine and becoming and real doctors<br>
		<br><br><br>We sixty students were a congenial bunch. We appreciated the 
		dedication of our teachers. They were overworked leaders in their 
		fields, teaching on top of immense practice loads as they covered for 
		their overseas fellows. After graduation, when I would go on with my 
		surgical training in the east, I would recognize the remarkable wisdom I 
		had received from these giants, for later in Boston I found myself fully 
		prepared, often better than those trained at Harvard and other 
		prestigious schools. <br><br>A good laugh was always at hand. One 
		example is the day on rounds that Leo Eloesser, Viennese and world 
		famous, was working over my group of six. All five feet of him would 
		stare up at the tallest, me in this case. He asked me what I knew about 
		synovial fluid (the lubricant of the joints). Completely unprepared for 
		anything about orthopedics, I said, &quot;Sir. I know it looks like water.&quot; 
		He then turned to Joe Oyster, not much taller than he, and accepted as 
		the top student in our class, with, in jest, &quot;Professor, what can you 
		tell me?&quot; We stood open mouthed as Joe detailed for minutes about 
		everything from salt content to enzymes. Where had we been all of the 
		time? Dr. Eloesser replied, &quot;Professor, I believe you are making that 
		up.&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir,&quot; was Joe’s response. The good doctor smiled, then walked 
		out to go to his office in a massive red Cadillac convertible, top down, 
		with a Pekinese Poodle resting in each corner. Can’t beat that.<br><br>
		One day at lunch after urology clinic, Frank Norman informed us, &quot;I just 
		met a crazy resident. I was trying to make him feel at home for he had 
		obviously recently come here. His Nordic accent was obvious. I told him 
		how much I enjoyed a most beautiful Swedish actress I had just seen at 
		the movie last night. Her name is Ingrid Bergman. Guess what this guy 
		said? Yes, I know. She is my vife.&quot; Of course. Now we knew that our 
		resident was her husband, Peter Lindstrom. We all went to the movies 
		that night.<br><br><br><br>I open a door and look inside<br><br><br><br>
		So, where was I in my development as a physician-to-be? First, I was 
		clearly on course, hands on each day as I learned about and at times 
		even added to the patients’ care. My Process Mind was proving adequate 
		for the job, though I seemed to learn differently from my fellows. It 
		was still one day at a time as I searched for signposts to an internship 
		with the most promise. I had decided, for sure, that I wished to be 
		exposed to various points of view. I believed that this would be best 
		served by going to the medical Holy City, said to be Boston. That would 
		surely keep the doors open, and perhaps open new doors, for the 
		internship was just a necessary stepping stone. I recognized from the 
		start that my tinkering tendency would only be satisfied in a field of 
		surgery. However, I also believed that a thorough grounding in internal 
		medicine and its revelations as to body physiology should be my 
		foundation before wielding the knife.<br><br>The Thorndyke Institute at 
		Boston City Hospital was the prize internship for me. I applied and took 
		the exam, but didn’t make the grade. Apparently I had a knowledge 
		deficiency, for I knew nothing about vascular disease, most prominently 
		that of “thrombophlebitis.” Later on I was to learn that this 
		complication, usually following surgery or with prolonged illness, was 
		endemic in the hot-cold East and almost never seen in our even, Western 
		climate. No wonder Eastern students were primed with answers about it.<br>
		<br><br><br>&quot;Fate&quot; takes a hand, I think<br><br><br><br>Fate now stepped 
		in as Bob Evans, our hematologist, somehow learned of my disappointment. 
		Why hadn’t I told him of my hopes, even though I was a &quot;do it on your 
		own&quot; guy. Big mistake, and one that I would now learn from. That evening 
		on the phone was William B. Castle, a great man and father of the cure 
		of pernicious anemia and the boss at Thorndyke. He said I was now the 
		first alternate, and he would keep in touch. Guess I had gotten a good 
		grade in hematology. <br><br>Then there was silence. The Navy began to 
		breath down my back and was ready to put me on active duty if a civilian 
		internship was not acquired. Then, just in time, Dr. Castle called back, 
		saying,&quot;Would you accept a surgical internship? All of our applicants 
		are making it.&quot; My answer was that I would do anything to get to Boston. 
		The 4th Surgical Service would be the bottom of the line, for it was the 
		only one having no medical school affiliation. So what? I would make it 
		work. <br><br>It may seem odd, but I had no qualms about not winning the 
		top-of-the-line job. Why? Because, like some doggerel I can’t quite 
		remember, &quot;if it ain’t good, I’ll make it so.&quot; I was learning that 
		life’s decisions are made in the &quot;light of one’s eye.&quot; What others saw 
		was not important. What was &quot;in my eye&quot; was all that counted. In 
		retrospect, what my eye saw in 4th Surgical would make it perhaps my 
		most valuable, and thus treasured, training experience of a lifetime.
		<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 7<br><br><br><br>BOSTON INTERNSHIP<br>
		<br><br><br>AN INTERNSHIP FOR A LIFETIME<br><br><br><br>What were those 
		nine months really like? My room was tiny and I made my own bed. Food 
		was abundant and free for house officers. It was at hasty meal times 
		that we learned about each other. $25 a month was our pay, and we had to 
		supply our own sneakers, typically worn through every three months, as 
		we walked, more often ran, through the miles of connecting tunnels. 
		Cases would be seen at Admitting and parceled out in an orderly fashion 
		to six surgical services. each manned by nine house officers. Operating 
		room procedures would be monitored by experienced and, occasionally, 
		famous surgeons in private practice. There was only one 
		anesthesiologist. The others were away at war. Peter Saunders made each 
		of us, interns particularly, proficient with spinal anesthesia, and the 
		new intravenous Pentothal. We rotated through the 
		specialties––neurosurgery, general surgery, orthopedics, and urology. 
		Although we were encouraged to go it on our own, never was supervision 
		not acting. I averaged 4-1/2 hours of sleep a night. This included our 
		biweekly Saturday afternoon and Sunday days off. I learned to catnap day 
		and night, and I can’t remember ever being tired. I treasured the 
		middle-of-night challenges, because that seemed to be when everything 
		was happening and I would learn the most. <br><br>There was something 
		else for me––I would get my internal medicine education as I squeezed 
		out time to go to medical rounds. Dr. Castle often presented the puzzles 
		inherent in exotic cases. Could I have ever imagined seeing three at one 
		time with Addison's Disease (adrenal gland failure) treated with 
		expensive hormones? Cortisone was then at least 15 years away.<br><br>A 
		treasured memory is the day on ward rounds when I was kibitzing the 
		50-student third-year class from Harvard. Dr. Castle had just examined a 
		post-surgical patient with markedly distended abdomen and asked for a 
		diagnosis. None scored. He saw me in back in my ragged surgical whites. 
		Knowing me to be a surgical intern he said, &quot;Dr. Lyon, any ideas?&quot; <br>
		<br>&quot;Sir, I believe it is a case of acute gastric dilation.&quot;<br><br>
		&quot;Thank you Dr. Lyon. Your Stanford training has served you well.&quot;<br>
		<br>Just as Hank scored in Madison Square Garden, so did I score as 
		Stanford demolished Harvard that day. What Dr. Castle did not know was 
		that Fritz Reichert, our Stanford neurosurgeon, had harped on this 
		problem day after day, for he had seen a death when cardiac arrest had 
		occurred, apparently triggered by unrecognized stomach distension. Thank 
		you Dr. Reichert. The height of my medical education was reached by 
		listening to, and then questioning, my elders––– a habit that has 
		followed me to this day.<br><br><br><br>Busiest day of my life<br><br>
		<br><br>My first day on the job in orthopedics introduced me to the 
		intensity of responsibilities to follow. I was given 30 patients. With 
		each new patient, five or six a day, it was my responsibility to write 
		the patient's history and record my physical findings, as well as 
		examine the urine and test the blood, and do a spinal tap when 
		inebriation was suspected. In that day, all intravenous fluids were 
		administered interns and residents. My day was a full one. Doctors are 
		roundly criticized for their atrocious handwriting. I suspect I am a 
		serious offender. Let me explain why.<br><br>My high school writing 
		teacher, Mrs. Beebe, directed that my handwriting meet the standards for 
		legibility and appearance. Engineering trained my printing ability to 
		the point I could print as fast as I could write longhand. My printed 
		notes were passed around in medical school, so legible were they. Then, 
		what happened?<br><br>The writing responsibilities and the time demands 
		at City Hospital forced me to write as fast as possible. I found myself 
		writing a hybrid of writing and printing that dogs me to this day. But 
		the nurses learned to interpret, and the work was done. In a way it 
		turned out to be a useful conspiracy between head nurses and this 
		doctor. Miss Havis, the epitome of the ideal head nurse, at Berkeley's 
		Alta Bates Hospital one day confided in me that only she could interpret 
		my handwritten orders. She further admitted that top surgeon Dexter 
		Richards and top internist Gale Whiting had the same defect. I was in 
		great company. The payoff for her was that she could maintain tight 
		control of her staff, as they checked with her when orders seemed 
		unreadable. The same applied to pharmacists throughout the Bay area. 
		They new instantly if the prescription they would fill was valid.<br>
		<br>My one-month orthopedic rotation was a joy. Tinkering tendencies, 
		combined with engineering concepts that required a three-dimensional 
		grasp of the problem, made it possible for me to innovate from day one. 
		A patient was admitted with a shattered elbow that would normally 
		require anesthesia and possibly open surgical reduction. Instead, with 
		cables, pulleys, and eye-screws purchased at the hardware store nearby, 
		his arm was literally hung up as day by day I molded the fragments into 
		place. A first hip nailing was scheduled. Who got the job? This 
		engineer, who then, in a tiny hot room equipped with a portable X-ray 
		unit, drilled into bone and inserted the pin, and it worked! A fractured 
		tibia seen in the emergency room gave me a chance to use the 
		just-acquired intravenous sodium pentothal for the few minutes it took 
		to drill a hole in the bone, place a rod called a Steinman Pin, and then 
		seal it all in plaster and send him home.<br><br>From the start I was 
		wonderfully at home in Boston City Hospital, where my boss watched every 
		step and approved. He suggested that I approach Dr. Green at Peter Bent 
		Hospital, the father of pediatric orthopedics, as to a residency with 
		him. Even then it was becoming clear that my heart would be with the 
		kids. He offered me the residency; residents were in short supply due to 
		the war. I didn’t get the chance, for someone in Washington made the 
		decision to send me to the front. That terminated at least one 
		possibility for my professional life to come. <br><br>I had toyed with 
		the idea of returning to San Francisco and starting a neurosurgical 
		residency with Dr. Nafzigger, if he would still have me. Neurosurgery 
		was really still in its infancy, but something was wrong. We would 
		operate, remove a brain tumor, and produce a &quot;vegetable.&quot; I wouldn’t be 
		content, no matter the stimulus of intricate surgery. Another possible 
		specialty bit the dust. As luck would have it, my second rotation was 
		with a famous man, Dr. Donald Munroe, who, also a tinkerer, had created 
		a tool to rehabilitate bladders, known as the Monroe Drainage 
		(eventually I would use it as a urologist). Urology problems were not 
		stimulating, and this specialty, too, at that time did not appeal to me.
		<br><br>Thus it was the surgical internship that taught me the most 
		lessons. Two incidents in the hands of my mentors are illustrative.<br>
		<br><br><br>My surgical mentors<br><br><br><br>Knute Browder was our 
		most attentive mentor. He was grizzled and gruff and noted for fast 
		surgeries. For instance, a gall bladder removal in 15 minutes was his 
		rule. I asked him why so fast? He told me that with the doctor shortage, 
		he would have to do up to 12 cases a day. And then there was the matter 
		of blood loss. It’s hard to believe, but surgical transfusions were just 
		coming into use, spurred by experience on the battlefields. The faster 
		the surgery, he had found, the less the blood loss. It all made sense.<br>
		<br>One day I admitted a patient with a &quot;hot appendix,&quot; and Dr. Moles, 
		my erratic resident, would do the case, Dr. Browder supervising. As Bob 
		Moles started to make the long mid-line incision demanded in all Boston 
		City Hospital cases where the initial diagnosis was often in doubt, 
		Knute grabbed Moles’ hand and said, &quot;Let’s do it right, through a 
		McBurney.&quot; This is a tiny incision over the appendix, and favored by 
		most old-timers. The incision was made, and Molse' probing finger 
		searched for the appendix. No luck. Knute’s finger went in and instantly 
		up popped a long black appendix, we supposed at the point of rupture. 
		Not so. As Dr. Moles reached for a clamp to remove the organ, Knute, 
		instead, poked it back into the hole. Moles tried again, and again Knute 
		had to pop up the gangrenous organ. Again Moles asked for the clamp. 
		Again Knute said, &quot;Not so fast. Try again,&quot; as the frightening organ was 
		returned to its bed. Moles by now, sweating profusely, this time flipped 
		up the appendix. It was removed, none the worse for wear. What I was 
		seeing was the massive wisdom of experience that told Knute Browder that 
		there was still a way to go to rupture, and Dr. Moles learned a valuable 
		lesson. <br><br>A second mentor was Dr. Morrison. He was quite different 
		from Dr. Browder. He was also in his sixties, handsome, tall, and 
		reserved and just as experienced. At midnight I admitted a man in his 
		seventies with all of the classic telltale signs of an acute 
		appendicitis. Classically, pain had started at the umbilicus and then 
		moved into the right lower quadrant. That area was exquisitely tender.<br>
		<br>Dr. Morrison came right in, after, I am sure, a busy day. These 
		mentors were dedicated, very special people. When he arrived, something 
		had changed. The tenderness was gone! I was embarrassed and started to 
		call the operating room to cancel the case. Dr. Morrison thought 
		otherwise. &quot;Dick, let’s go.&quot;<br><br>At surgery I removed a reddish black 
		swollen &quot;hot appendix.&quot; How had I messed up? My lesson followed. Dr. 
		Morrison said that in the elderly and occasionally in childhood, the 
		tissue reaction would be a rapid accumulation of fluid, or &quot;transudate,&quot; 
		that would act as a poultice and for a little while it would mask the 
		problem. How lucky could I be, for this warning was not in the books. 
		And this was only one day of lessons at Boston City Hospital!<br><br>
		Learning could have its humorous side, too. On my first day on as a 
		surgeon on 4 Surgical, Dr. Moles told me to admit a patient for Dr. 
		Browder and get her ready for surgery. This lady gave me a history of 
		recurrent flank pain. She was to have her kidney stuck in place. 
		&quot;Nephropexy,&quot; or fixing the kidney so as to no longer drop, was a 
		procedure not yet in my learning curve. Physical exam revealed nothing 
		abnormal. I was to have another interesting learning experience ahead, I 
		feared.<br><br>On ward rounds that afternoon, Dr. Moles read my report 
		and said, &quot;Dick please examine her abdomen again.&quot; Wow! There was a 
		round mobile mass in the right lower quadrant. It felt like a kidney, 
		and I had missed it. Better go back to school was my first reaction. 
		Embarrassed? You bet. <br><br>As we turned to leave the room, Dr. Moles 
		said, &quot;Mrs. Jones, you can put your kidney back now.&quot; With a twist and a 
		turn, she reached down and with one motion, popped the kidney back into 
		place in her side. I had been &quot;had,&quot;” not knowing then that I would see 
		my share of these in a urological practice not then considered a 
		possibility. <br><br>My internship had slipped rapidly by. I had to go 
		to war as a Navy Junior Lieutenant. At Newport, after a few lazy days of 
		tennis, I was ordered to report to the Admiral. He looked as if he had 
		bad news. From the Navy standpoint, he did. &quot;Dr. Lyon, you are assigned 
		to the Marines and will report immediately to Parris Island for 
		training.&quot; <br><br>Surprised, I found myself smiling and saying, &quot;That’s 
		great. I never considered being a Marine, but it suits me fine.&quot; I was 
		thinking that there would be no cushy quarters and hot showers, but I 
		couldn’t remember anything I enjoyed more than beating the rigors of a 
		Boy Scout in camp. The Admiral shook his head.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
		CHAPTER 8 <br><br><br><br>I BECOME A MARINE<br><br><br><br><br><br>A 
		Marine is on his way.<br><br><br><br>With my entry into the Marine Corps 
		came the next surprise. Instead of getting into the rigorous training I 
		had expected and was a little anxious about, twenty-five other medical 
		recruits and I were gathered around a table to receive some news. Half 
		of us would be on our way west immediately, still fresh and untrained, 
		to fill spots as Battalion Surgeons making ready for the next invasion. 
		Next question: &quot;Is there any reason anyone of you are not ready to go?&quot; 
		&quot;Is he kidding?&quot; I whispered to Roland French, also from 4 Surgical. It 
		wasn’t a matter of &quot;being ready&quot;; it surely had to be &quot;Get Going!&quot; The 
		officer went around the table. There were more than a few that had such 
		nebulous answers as to be funny, such as, &quot;I need to take my wife home,&quot; 
		and the like. I turned to Roland and said, &quot;Is this guy serious? We’re 
		at war aren’t we?&quot; My answer was, &quot;Sir, I can’t think of a single reason 
		not to go,&quot; believing this was all a show. <br><br>Roland and I were 
		chosen with a few others. I went to the PX (post exchange) and outfitted 
		myself in the real thing, a Marine Uniform. Then I went to the 
		dispatcher, who inquired, &quot;How would you like to go?&quot; I replied, &quot;Do you 
		have a wagon train available?&quot; He laughed and said, &quot;No, but would you 
		like to take a route to, say, see a girl friend?&quot; &quot;Good idea. I’ll go by 
		way of New York.&quot; I did just that, stayed overnight, then landed in 
		Pendleton, California, the next day.<br><br>That was when the fooling 
		around stopped. I was promptly assigned to the 4th Marine Division 
		training on the Hawaian island of Maui. Hours later, I was on my way on 
		an APA (Attack Personnel Transport) to the First Battalion, 24th 
		Regiment, 4th Marine Division FMF (Fleet Marine Force), there to meet my 
		new boss, Dr. Dick Porter, and be his assistant in the invasion moments 
		away.<br><br><br><br>We Marines go west to something<br><br><br><br>
		Things didn’t go the way I expected it would or should. We rendezvoused 
		in Pearl Harbor, sitting immobile for three weeks as I watched the 
		erosion of physical conditioning of our men. Daily tennis at the 
		Officers’ Club seemed like a dream, so I made the most of it. Finally we 
		steamed away to the west. Our destination, we were told, was a tiny 
		island, Iwo Jima, well fortified and manned by seasoned troops. My 
		comrades had been in three previous invasions, so I believed that I, the 
		neophyte, was in the best hands possible. This proved to be so.<br><br>
		We sailed out as a convoy in our APA, 5,000 marines and their explosives 
		and vehicles. The nights were clear and skies star-filled. When others 
		were at the poker table or reading, I would wend my way through the 
		dark, banging my head on bulkheads, to reach the foredeck. I would stand 
		there looking up, identifying constellations I had just mentally 
		photographed from my small star book. Going to and coming from Iwo Jima, 
		I learned to identify 65 constellations and all of the navigational 
		stars. My last exploit was to master the navigation forms, so that with 
		a sextant I could pilot our APA, or a lifeboat at worst. One evening on 
		the way back, I asked the navigation officer to show me how he did 
		things. He took out a star book. I said, &quot;Can’t you identify the stars 
		without that?&quot; The officer, a dentist by trade, looked surprised, 
		causing me to say,&quot; I’m sure glad we are in the middle of a convoy.&quot; <br>
		<br><br><br>It was Iwo Jima <br><br><br><br>We anchored in the company 
		of thousands of ships of every kind. Destroyers, cruisers, and 
		battleships were shelling the island, as they had been doing for weeks. 
		The first waves of Marines had reached the beach. Our turn to disembark 
		and jump into landing craft occurred about 2:00 p.m. Our corpsmen were 
		scattered into many LCVPs (landing craft) in order to make unlikely the 
		loss of our whole unit from a single direct hit. All headed for the 
		beach, reaching it as darkness came on. All I remember is standing on 
		sand at the water’s edge in the midst of landing craft and looking for 
		someone familiar. The beached ships were trying to deliver their goods 
		as mortar blasts chipped away, the island’s defenders having perfected 
		their aim on the beaches. The death toll was immense, for our positions 
		could be anticipated by the enemy, and easily &quot;zeroed in.&quot;<br><br>Coming 
		out of nowhere, our executive officer, Buck Schecter, grabbed me and 
		yelled, &quot;Doc, let’s get out of here. Follow me!&quot; We scrambled up over 
		the dunes to the vicinity of our battalion, each of us digging a foxhole 
		with our small shovels, in which to hunker down for the night. No Spam 
		or C-rations for the moment. The sky was alive with bright, whistling 
		shells, thundering as they hit the sand and its occupants. That is all I 
		can remember, except that a young Marine, afraid to the point of tears, 
		lay in my arms throughout the night. <br><br>Strangely, I wasn’t afraid. 
		I was fascinated. Perhaps it was my acceptance of whatever might come as 
		I devoted every moment to doing my job. I worked with our corpsmen who 
		didn’t need to be told what to do. My Boy Scout first aid training 
		served me well. The designation &quot;Battalion Surgeon,&quot; was impressive, but 
		in fact it was &quot;first aid&quot; all of the way.<br><br>With our combat 
		platoons out in front, we support platoons worked our way northward up 
		the beach just below the airfield. It was foxhole to foxhole. The 
		engineer in this doc manifested, when time and time again, we would spot 
		mortar shells, like speeding birds, coming our way. I placed sticks 
		upright in such a way that I could, by triangulation, recognize those 
		coming at us, though without knowing their eventual points of impact. 
		They could be in front or behind, so that with a threatening sighting, I 
		moved the medical unit one way or another and out of the line of fire. 
		After six days, we reached the quarry that would be our home until our 
		26th day, when the island was finally secured and we departed.<br><br>
		Our medical unit and its docs, Dick Porter and I, were fortunate to have 
		very likely the lowest casualty rate on the island. I think we were just 
		plain lucky. Also, Big Dick Porter, all of 6’5,” and most of the 
		corpsman were seasoned veterans of three previous landings in the 
		Marshall Islands’ invasions. They knew their business and rules for 
		survival, not the least of which was, &quot;If someone calls for help, call 
		for rifle cover, because the enemy marksman will be zeroed in on his hit 
		and waiting for you.&quot; Our only mortality occurred just that way. We lost 
		one of our prized new corpsman who had planned to go to medical school.<br>
		<br>One of the challenges about which I became particularly sensitive 
		was the matter of so-called &quot;battle fatigues.&quot; These youngsters were 
		being sent to the hospital ships to be forever tagged with guilt. Early 
		on I recognized that these episodes of terror were short and reversible. 
		It was understandable that these Marines had to be evacuated so as not 
		to put their platoons at risk. I took the responsibility of heavily 
		sedating each boy with sleeping pills––really knocked him out––and 
		letting him sleep for 12 hours or so. On awakening, calmed, he would 
		talk with me. From that point on, almost every likely &quot;battle fatigue&quot; 
		went back to his platoon, some becoming heroes, for all I know. The 
		fallout was that as we prepared for the next invasion where I would be 
		boss, I pilfered a case of sodium pentothal from the regiment stores. I 
		would then have the means to be truly effective. My Boston City Hospital 
		experience with this new wonder drug was paying off. I was also becoming 
		aware of the building blocks each day that experience provides, as once 
		lined up, they can do wonderful things, although at the time of creating 
		the blocks, they were just &quot;incidents.&quot;<br><br>In strife like this, 
		humor is sidelined, for there isn’t much humor to tap into in war. But 
		there must be. For instance, we were told not to take cameras into 
		combat. I understood this rule for, although my camera was my log, I had 
		no desire either to have a camera eye recording the trauma I would see, 
		or even to think about anything that would take my mind off my job, if 
		just for an instant. But it did occur to me that as we completed our 
		mission, there might be a time when photos of our men might be 
		worthwhile. Therefore, I placed my prized Contax camera in the safest 
		place I could think of, the Exec’s desk, hoping it might come ashore at 
		a quiet time. On Day 20 or so it was in direct view, 25 yards from the 
		beach, when a mortar shell made a direct hit. I can still see the craft 
		and its contents bubbling slowly as it descended to the bottom. I have 
		to smile, though, for all that was lost could be replaced, and the boat 
		master swam safely to shore.<br><br>This led me again to be the 
		tinkerer. I recalled the original Eastman box camera with its single 
		exposure shutter and no lens. Why not make a similar &quot;pin hole&quot; camera? 
		I scrounged a roll of film, probably from a Marine cameraman, located a 
		small box; made my pin hole, and took a dozen shots. This camera and its 
		photos would today be in a museum, but that was not to be. Again I tried 
		to find the safest place for my treasure. It ended up in the stores on 
		my medically-loaded jeep, to be transported in the hold of our return 
		ship. I still had a lot to learn. My jeep was empty when we recovered it 
		on Maui. My Marine buddies had a good laugh. Didn’t I know that anytime 
		there were goodies not locked up securely, especially coming home from 
		combat, the &quot;swabbies&quot; would steal us blind, and then sell to 
		starry-eyed recruits, even our C-ration utensils, as captured Japanese 
		souvenirs?<br><br><br><br>

		battle won, we go back to Maui and pick up the pieces<br><br><br><br>The 
		return to Pearl Harbor was a time to enjoy good meals and a shower or 
		two, to complete the solemn duty of writing to the families of our lost 
		comrades, and to make recommendations for honors to be awarded for 
		heroism.<br><br>Heroism is usually not obvious. It occurred quietly and 
		unheralded many times each day on Iwo. My experience with Corpsman 
		Flores serves as an example. We lost one of our finest men in the 
		sniping just described. I had a problem––– either to send Danny 
		Danhauer, a green corpsman without front line platoon experience–––or to 
		ask corpsman Flores, battle-wise after three invasions and known to all 
		the platoons, to fill in as this battle was ending. His job was done. 
		His war tour would be over and he was scheduled to be on his way to the 
		mainland as soon as we left the island.<br><br>Flores said, &quot;I’ll go,&quot; 
		picked up his carbine and disappeared over the brim of the hill into the 
		valley of possible death. This was to me the ultimate bravery, based on 
		the love that permeated our team of Navy Marines.<br><br>I requested 
		that he be awarded the Silver Star. I had been warned that officers 
		always got the benefit of the doubt, but not the enlisted men. I had 
		better ask for the higher honor. Flores received the Bronze Star. I 
		don’t think he ever understood why, surprised to receive any award at 
		all. He was just doing his duty. What a privilege to be a Marine and a 
		Navy man to boot!<br><br><br><br>

		Bruce “missing in action”<br><br>I can never forget my mail the day we 
		anchored in Honolulu. The last letter from Mom and Dad said Bruce was 
		&quot;missing in action.&quot; Quite by myself on the bow, I cried, and cried, and 
		cried. Why such grief when he was &quot;just missing in action,&quot; and there 
		was still hope that his chute had carried him to safety? It had been 
		twenty days, and there was still no word. I knew that a Lyon brother, no 
		matter the circumstances, would have figured out some way to let Mom and 
		Dad know that he was all right. <br><br>As the pilot of his B24 on his 
		32nd mission and with a new crew returning from a successful raid, a 
		defective bomb in his own bombay or one dropped from a returning plane 
		above, took the lives of all but three. And here surfaced another 
		personal quality. Despite two different stories from a crew member and 
		the doctor in his squadron, I took no joy in assessing blame, and this 
		would be a lifelong principle, for to me it was only this day and the 
		day ahead that could make a difference. So, get on with it, adjust, 
		regroup, and move ahead. Move ahead? Bruce was gone. How could I 
		respond? I would take on his mission and work harder than ever. Could I 
		do the work of two? Absolutely. Our rules for living were the same. Joys 
		and pain I would share. His Purple Heart graces this computer. Bruce’s 
		birthday and death day is my universal password. Do I still grieve? Of 
		course, and he is a vital driving part of anything I might have 
		achieved.<br><br><br><br>We rest and then prepare again on Maui<br><br>
		<br><br>On Maui the remnants of our regiment returned to tents, mess 
		halls, and many days of just lolling about as we regrouped. Our Makawao 
		base on the west side of Mount Haleakala, was the spot on the island 
		noted only for its rainfall. The Army had abandoned it as unlivable. But 
		better place to toughen a Marine. A day off would find traveling by jeep 
		about two miles to the south where suddenly the sheet of rain ended, and 
		sun bathed everything. So there were compensations.<br><br>Big Dick 
		Porter had earned a battle-free berth after four invasions. I was now 
		nominally the boss, but my Navy chiefs, made everything go. I learned 
		from Martin Middlewood and his men every day. Because the doc didn’t 
		have to march and struggle through the boondocks, I found myself 
		organizing basketball teams for officers and enlisted men. A quartette 
		with me as its tenor, good ear for harmony but a lousy squeaky voice, 
		made us a fixture at the General’s parties. What great food! And I 
		played the accordion at officers’ gatherings, as singing seemed to 
		diminish inebriation. My new assistant, Doc Owen, was also trained in 
		surgery. He would go on to an illustrious career in Seattle, but then 
		was just as green as I had been four months earlier.<br><br>Before 
		leaving the mainland I had ordered every medical and surgical journal I 
		could think of, to keep my mind active and up to date Thus we had our 
		own medical library and the journals showed up, to the point that I that 
		received the Mayo Clinic Bulletin on Day 15 on Iwo. We two docs were 
		swimmers in college, so on days off duty, we drove to the wild west 
		cost, and with fins, ride the surf. It sounds like it was all fun for 
		the moment. I guess it was. We didn’t dwell on what lay ahead or make 
		plans for the future. We knew they would be made for us soon enough.<br>
		<br>And again there were humorous happenings. Our battalion team won all 
		of its games, as I coached the &quot;uncoachables.&quot; It came down to the Maui 
		championship, the winner to go to Honolulu for the Pacific Theater 
		Championship finals.<br><br>We were a fast-breaking bunch. Our opponents 
		were led by Indiana All American guard Andy Phillips. They were 
		deliberate stop-and-shoot artists. Col. Banks, our boss, ordered me to 
		win. He had a bundle at risk.<br><br>Our first fast-break play landed 
		Captain Joe Swoyer against the wall after a lay-up. Then mayhem broke 
		loose. It suddenly dawned on us that the floor was hopelessly slippery, 
		having been waxed for a dance the night before. Or did Andy and his 
		Heavy Weapons battalion outsmart us and become wax-masters? Andy, 
		laughing at me all the way, won the game and then the championship. 
		Their joy, however, would be short lived, for it was just a few weeks 
		later that we received our orders to prepare for our next invasion––the 
		mainland of Japan. The chips were down.<br><br>I had given a great deal 
		of thought to what we would face. My Japan travels had well prepared me 
		to judge our enemy. They would be implacable, the peasants as well as 
		the soldiers. The Bushido Samauri spirit of centuries would be manifest 
		as death was the choice To surrender was to be a coward, also punishable 
		by death. Kamikazes would be our first barrier, striking us at sea as we 
		would move sluggishly. Our APAs carried 5,000 Marines each, their 
		vehicles and munitions below as veritable bombs in themselves. 10,000 
		kamikazes, dedicated to dying meant that if only 1,000 survived our 
		shellfire, that 1,000 would take a least 500,000 American lives, these 
		the cream of the crop. Britain had taken the same beating, and its loss 
		of the best and the brightest is manifest today in the indecision that 
		followed.<br><br>This would be just the beginning. My First Battalion, 
		24th Regiment, would be the first wave on the lower island, Kyushu. I 
		could only imagine the bloody encounters that would immediately ensue as 
		we would fight our way, not only against soldiers, but women and 
		children armed with bats and perhaps knives. Our troops would have to be 
		protected by undefendable bombing, often carpet-bombing. The devastation 
		would be complete. Japan’s loveliest cities, most filled with ancient 
		treasures, would perish. Cities such as Kyoto and Nara, with their 
		irreplaceable temples and gardens, would be turned to ashes. Our world 
		would be forever maimed. Bombs would take hundreds of thousands, perhaps 
		millions of Japanese lives. And there were still, in our halls of power 
		at home, voices calling for restraint and discussion. Didn’t they know 
		anything about a Bushido culture, that free of any outside influence, 
		was still in place? The &quot;Shoguns&quot; remained in control, their mouthpiece 
		General Togo. Did they not realize that Russia, after Yalta, was 
		mobilizing to invade too, and that a Berlin-like confrontation would 
		result?<br><br>We were on the Maui beaches ready to go. Transports 
		(APAs) lay just off the beaches to allow us, fully loaded, to practice 
		climbing up and down on the rope ladders. Was there any discussion of 
		our future? No, our task was just to get where we were going. On our 
		training, and on fate itself, we would depend for survival.<br><br><br>
		<br>Then the Miracle--we can go home!<br><br><br><br>Standing next to 
		the communications Jeep, I heard something to the tune that a single, 
		new super bomb had just been dropped on Hiroshima. The city was gone. 
		All of my Japanese history lessons and the experience of watching the 
		Bushido culture close at hand as a boy condensed into a, &quot;Gus, the war 
		is over.&quot; Col. Banks, our commander, exclaimed, &quot;Come on Doc, you’re 
		full of it!&quot; Guess not. The war was over! The Emperor, being realistic 
		and knowing he was human after all, saw the inevitable and regained his 
		omnipotence. We could all go home and not find ourselves in untenable 
		positions as we fought to live another day.<br><br>I looked back later, 
		and long after the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, recognized that our lots 
		would have been similar. Could we as as a Christian nation have dealt 
		successfully with our guilt? I can’t imagine the consequences. Young 
		Americans, please listen. Harry Truman’s lonely decision will, 
		hopefully, rank as one of the greatest in history, as a &quot;deciding,&quot; not 
		&quot;turning&quot; point in time. Thanks Harry. Guess these words would never be 
		written had your wisdom not prevailed.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 9 <br><br>
		<br><br>BOSTON ADVENTURE<br><br><br><br>Next open door closed for good 
		by Carol<br><br><br><br>It was time to go home and pick up life’s 
		threads. Overnight our 24th Battalion decamped, and in a matter of days, 
		after making sure that our parents knew we really were home, all were 
		assigned close by in peaceful pursuits. I was sent to the Navy medical 
		unit at Alameda Air Station. For six months with Blue Beauty in motion, 
		I luxuriated in my America––tennis, golf, and skiing––but pieces of my 
		career had to be picked up. My fellow physicians at my stage of training 
		were one step ahead of me, for they had already secured the precious 
		residencies. Had they seen the war coming to such an abrupt end? I doubt 
		it. I think they were more realistic, anticipating their discharge from 
		the services, while I still lived one day at a time. And I still do, as 
		I go with the winds.<br><br>In my case the wind was Carol. Standing by 
		the rope tow at the Sierra Club in Norden, I spotted this skier gliding 
		towards me. I turned to Instructor Bill Klein, and said, &quot;Who is that 
		beautiful skier?&quot; I was referring to more than skiing motions. &quot;May I 
		meet her?&quot; That did it, and my future as a husband was in the works. At 
		the same time, my future as a provider was in limbo and could no longer 
		be put off. We were married six months later in Grace Cathedral in San 
		Francisco, and the next episode in this real life's drama took off.<br>
		<br>Had anything happened to change my pattern of taking one day at a 
		time? Yes. For the first time there were two of us. &quot;One day at a time&quot; 
		would now always require a more detailed look at the long haul at stake. 
		I still had to examine a next step, and it had to still follow my rule 
		of keeping all the doors open until Carol and I would settle into a 
		chosen life‘s work, together.<br><br><br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/family458.jpg" style="float: left">We 
		open Boston’s portal on our honeymoon<br><br><br><br>My intention to be 
		exposed to other medical disciplines had not changed. The Boston City 
		Hospital internship had been exciting. It was time to go on. I had saved 
		up enough money to allow a few months of exploration in Boston, it now 
		obvious that I would be a surgeon. Years of surgical residency was the 
		next step. I must still keep doors open for a specialty. My fascination 
		with the mysteries of the sympathetic nervous system had increased. This 
		had started in medical school when neurosurgeon Livingston at the 
		University of Oregon proved that a single small injection of anesthetic 
		into what he called the &quot;trigger point&quot; in a painful amputation stump 
		could end the otherwise permanently debilitating &quot;phantom limb&quot; pain. 
		Beyond this, the sympathectomy surgery of Reginald Smithwick in Boston 
		could be dramatic in ending life-threatening hypertension. That was 
		enough of a carrot for me. I could meet surgical residency demands, 
		while entering a specialty that needed to be recognized and then 
		available throughout the country. It seemed like the ground floor of 
		something that an engineer, with his familiarity with wires and tracts 
		might help develop, but how was I to break into the patriarchal system 
		that was Boston?<br><br>Carol and I mixed serious business with fun as 
		I, figuratively, &quot;camped,&quot; on the doorstep of Boston Memorial Hospital 
		(Boston University). I would not be dislodged. In the meantime, we drove 
		around historic New England and upper New York State in our sporty, red 
		Packard convertible, acquired for $600 during my internship. That price 
		was the result of wartime gas limitation; the car had been rusting on 
		blocks. We often camped out in our pup tent in the unlikeliest of spots. 
		One dark night we were getting desperate for a somewhere to stay in 
		upper New York State. I saw a place, turned in to a driveway, then 
		pitched the tent in the dark. We had a wonderful night’s sleep until 
		voices awakened us and Carol poked her head out. Low and behold, 
		church-goers were waving at us, for we were squarely in their cemetery. 
		In Bar Harbor, Maine, it was in the city dump, and in New Hampshire it 
		was a football field, where we were told unceremoniously to &quot;git.&quot;<br>
		<br>Dr. Smithwick could not get me out of his hair. He was used to 
		Harvard interns and residents in the hallowed Massachusetts General 
		Hospital he had just left to be Massachusetts Memorials’ Chief of 
		Surgery. Interns there kept their gowns spotless. As third and second 
		assistants, they had trouble at times seeing what the surgeon was doing. 
		We Boston City Hospital residents, in tattered but clean surgical gowns, 
		had been on the active surgical battlefront from day one as we assisted 
		accomplished surgeons.<br><br>On top of this, I was a westerner, perhaps 
		even a cowboy, from some small college on the west coast! Didn’t I know 
		that a Bostonian thought that Worcester, 59 miles away, was the real 
		West? But what Dr. Reginald Smithwick would learn was that we true 
		westerners are tenacious when we see a goal we must reach.<br><br><br>
		<br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/Laurie143.jpg" style="float: left">Dr. 
		Smithwick’s door finally opens. I walk in<br><br><br><br>In December, 
		Dr. Smithwick caved in, but first I had to spend six months as a 
		surgical researcher. So what? I would do anything to get in the 
		operating room with him. And that is when a mechanism fell into place 
		that would put me in the production line toward surgery of the 
		sympathetic nervous system.<br><br>I was assigned as an assistant to Dr. 
		Edward Free, who would eventually be Mr. Hypertension in the NIH in 
		Washington. I worked with Harvard graduate Joe Stanton, and we quickly 
		melded into a team. This was duck soup for me, because I was back into 
		measuring, and then graphing, data, in this case having to do with 
		surgical blood loss. We perfected the use of a special new dye, T1824 
		(Evans Blue), and were able to do wonders with it as we uncovered how 
		the liver, as it builds plasma, really works. I became a seasoned 
		researcher, manipulating the spectroscope with the best. I was also 
		assigned a small room to test skin temperatures with a massive 
		instrument that had been used for controls on airplane engines. This 
		engineer was in heaven.<br><br><br><br>Carol won’t be left behind<br>
		<br><br><br>What did Carol do with her time? At a party, having been 
		stuck in one corner with the ladies and seeing the men in another corner 
		having such a good time, she decided not to remain deprived. She took 
		Pre-med courses at Boston University and kibitzed at Harvard third-year 
		medical student classes in the hospitals. Disaster would lurk as she 
		picked up a little information, especially when it touched her. At the 
		Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, during rounds, iconic George Thorn was 
		showing a child with nephrosis, her tissues edematous (swollen) as the 
		result of streptococcal infection endemic on the East Coast and rare out 
		West.<br><br>Carol remembered her own sick bout at age five when a fever 
		of 105 was ominous and the doctors disagreed as to treatment––no sulfas 
		or antibiotics existed then. Her meek pediatrician wanted to wait it out 
		and hope for the best. Surgeon Krakow predicted that not to operate, and 
		remove infected tonsils and adenoids, would likely be fatal. The 
		courageous surgeon won. Carol’s temperature dropped immediately to 
		normal, and she fully recovered.<br><br>There is more to the story: The 
		Brigham child also seemed to have survived her infection. Later on, 
		though, the signs of kidney damage appeared and were now manifested as 
		slowly fatal glomerular nephritis. This was the malady with which I had 
		become so familiar in Dr. Addis’ lab as a student at Stanford. Carol put 
		two and two together. She was scared. So was I. To reassure her, on a 
		Sunday morning I heated some vinegar (acetic acid) and added her urine. 
		The heavy cloud that resulted left no doubt that the protein (albumin) 
		component was high. We promptly went to the hospital lab, and again the 
		test was positive, but there was something reassuring. I &quot;spun down&quot; 
		with my centrifuge, particles that might be diagnostic in her urine. If 
		there were casts or cells present consistent with kidney disease, my 
		Addis training assured that I would recognize them. The specimen was 
		beautifully clear. Dr. Addis had taught me that a heavy proteinuria like 
		this is not seen with kidney disease, but with a benign syndrome, 
		orthostatic proteinuria, where the protein appears only with patient 
		activity in the upright (orthostatic) position. I was sure of the 
		diagnosis, but when it was recommended that Dr. Williams, a Boston 
		expert, be consulted I said, &quot;Not on your life.&quot; I had seen enough of 
		these so-called experts to be fully disenchanted. I was sure Dr. 
		Williams didn’t know one cast from another in the urinary sediment, and 
		to him Tom Addis was likely to be considered just another western 
		aberration. Only when we went West to my urological residency did I ask 
		Bud Persike, like me trained by the wonderful man, to see Carol. I 
		offered no opinion. He called me promptly to confirm the good news. Once 
		again, &quot;Thank you, Thomas Addis.&quot;<br><br>A second episode at the Peter 
		Bent Brigham has a longer history. Carol was listening to the famous Dr. 
		Kolff, inventor of the artificial kidney. He announced that there were 
		three questions he wished to be asked. These would be rewarded with his 
		signed original monograph. Two of the questioners received their prizes. 
		The third question lay in limbo. Carol, having been told each day of my 
		work relating to pulmonary embolism, nudged the student next to her and 
		said to him, &quot;Why don't you ask how the blood is kept from clotting in 
		the machine?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You ask it,&quot; he said. Carol laughed as she 
		responded, &quot;Are you kidding? They’ll throw me out.&quot; This student won the 
		monograph. He should have handed it to Carol. Thirty years later in Dr. 
		Frank Hinman’s home in San Francisco, I told guest Dr. Kolff about the 
		incident. The signed monograph arrived at our home two days later. It 
		has a place of honor on my office wall.<br><br><br><br>Dr. Smithwick 
		finally keeps his promise; I am in surgical whites again<br><br><br><br>
		Dr. Smithwick dragged his feet getting me into a house officer’s whites. 
		More than once I reminded him of his promise. I finally was made the 
		lone resident in the Framingham Boston University Hospital at the margin 
		of the city. I was on my surgical way. Three months later I became chief 
		resident in the big hospital, charged with full patient care: IV’s, 
		surgical schedule, and assistant to Drs. Smithwick, Whitelaw, and 
		Graham, who perhaps expected me to follow in their footsteps.<br><br>
		<br><br>An unnoticed door opens<br><br><br><br>Two seminal events took 
		place during my eighteen months at Massachusetts Memorial Hospital with 
		its Boston University Medical School faculty. The first would open up 
		for me a lifetime of stimulating events, as I found myself pioneering an 
		entirely new science that would affect all fields of medicine and 
		surgery. It was about time, for morbidity, and even mortality, was out 
		of control everywhere from a lack of understanding of the chemical 
		components in lost body secretions, and the need for their prompt 
		replacement with suitable solutions. Salt and water alone were far from 
		enough, and I would find myself on the road for years bringing this 
		message. The new science would be called &quot;Fluid Electrolyte Balance.&quot; It 
		started this way.<br><br><br><br>I inadvertently become a pioneer in 
		fluid electrolyte balance<br><br><br><br>I was strolling through the 
		surgical ward, looking a subject for a blood test in our research study 
		of blood regeneration. My eye caught an inert patient just an arm’s 
		length away, festooned with IV tubing and drainage catheters. Dr. 
		Douglas Farmer had just come from the Massachusetts General Hospital to 
		be an assistant professor of surgery. This was his ward.<br><br>&quot;Dr. 
		Farmer, what is the diagnosis?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He is dying in hepatic (liver) 
		coma. He is icteric (jaundiced) and his plasma proteins are half of 
		normal as a result, and thus the edema. To make things worse, he is the 
		father of a medical student.&quot;<br><br>&quot;May I take a crack at him, Dr. 
		Farmer?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course, he’s yours. We’ve given up.&quot;<br><br>It was 
		obvious to me that he was overloaded with fluid. This was a day when the 
		term &quot;fluid balance&quot; was almost unknown. The diagnosis of edema (swollen 
		tissues) depended entirely on the eye of the physician. I was just 
		beginning to tap into a massive defect in care, where normal saline (9 
		grams of salt/liter) in an IV was deemed the accepted universal antidote 
		for all hydration problems, the physician focusing only on the urine 
		output as the critical measurement.<br><br>I stopped all IVs. It took 
		just three days for Mr. Feldman to wake up. His edema disappeared as his 
		legs approached normal, but the most sticking change was a serum protein 
		that went from 3 to a normal 6 mgm./liter, while he had eaten nothing. 
		Protein was clearly not being created. It was being diluted! On the 
		tenth day, with body water and tissues back to normal, he was discharged 
		to home.<br><br>So, what had happened? I don’t recall why he was in the 
		hospital, but it was clear that he had been massively overloaded with 
		salt and water. The swollen liver’s ducts were blocked, and cell 
		mechanisms were compromised. Protein formation by the liver cells had 
		stopped. The hemoglobin, freed as normal red cell replacement occurred, 
		was trapped. Jaundice was the result. It was a case of overload, a 
		condition I would contend with repeatedly in the years ahead.<br><br>Did 
		the concept of a scale to weigh the excess water in this inert patient 
		enter my thoughts then? No. I had not the least idea of the massive part 
		of my medical life ahead that this element would play. Experts in that 
		day, such as Francis Moore at Massachusetts General, and Carl Moyer in 
		the Midwest, had not yet emphasized the true problem, but they must have 
		known about it. Only in Minnesota in 1943 had the now renowned professor 
		of surgery, Owen Wangensteen, seen the truth as he constructed a massive 
		scale, much like that in a butcher shop of that day. No one took notice. 
		This lack of acceptance occurred again in 1948, when his article 
		appeared in the New England Journal. This man is a legend today, for he 
		introduced the first effective tube that with suction decompresses the 
		obstructed bowel. It is still a staple known as Wangensteen Suction. His 
		equally great contribution to body weight and water is still 
		unrecognized.<br><br>However, something was happening to me that would 
		intensify through the years. Recognizing a problem and then solving it 
		was not new to me. It was by then a habit. What was new is the matter of 
		being &quot;effective.&quot; And this became my mantra and has remained so to the 
		present day. It is, in the end, all that counts! I’m sure Mr. Feldman 
		would have agreed.<br><br><br><br>Fatal pulmonary embolization is 
		tackled and prevented<br><br><br><br>This second sequence is also the 
		story of another &quot;awakening.&quot; With my research time completed, I was at 
		this point the surgical resident, and I had acquired a chore that was 
		just plain burdensome. Recall that I had flunked the exam for a 
		Thorndyke internship because I knew nothing about the syndrome of 
		thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism and its often fatal outcome. 
		Here I was with 12 of my 120 patients in that state. This required that 
		I administer the anticoagulant Heparin intravenously every eight hours. 
		That would have been easy, but I had to do a complicated bleeding and 
		clotting test before each injection, and I was back in the lab again. 
		This turned out to be a &quot;break point&quot; in my life.<br><br>Now that my 
		medical training and experience had reached a certain level of 
		proficiency, I would find my engineering principles at times filling in 
		gaps in the medical knowledge I gained in school and on the job, 
		allowing me to see things in a different light from my colleagues. I 
		would recognize problems unnoticed by others and then, as the tinkerer, 
		by habit try to solve them.<br><br>All medical students are familiar 
		with the tendency for blood to rapidly clot when allowed to stand, 
		thereby spoiling a specimen. By keeping the blood in motion, it tends to 
		stay fluid, but was anyone considering that motion is a good idea? How 
		about just speeding the flow through the big main vein in the lower leg, 
		the calf, the section prone to inflammation, particularly with 
		inactivity in surgery and after. Why hadn’t this been thought of by 
		others familiar with the clotting mechanisms?<br><br>Our hematology 
		department was known worldwide, so I treaded lightly, but I had one 
		great advantage. Dr. Fries, my research boss, had trained me well in 
		research processes, so that when I broached my idea to Dr. Smithwick, he 
		said, &quot;Why not. Go ahead. You and Dr. Fries know the ropes.&quot;<br><br>The 
		idea? Bernoulli, father of fluid dynamics, had made it very clear that 
		the velocity of a fluid in a pipe could be markedly increased with very 
		little change in the pipe’s diameter. A vein is not a rigid pipe, but 
		could we apply this principle, and speed the flow in the single large 
		deep vein, the site of clot formation? We had the tools, the Evans Blue 
		dye that I injected many times each day, and the radio-opaque dye used 
		for kidney x-rays. We could track as well as see the flow when pressure 
		was applied. Dr. Fries found us aviators’ pressure puttees (tight 
		restraints) used in high-speed airplane dives. With our first try, the 
		speed of venous blood flow doubled, and this was proved over and over 
		again. The incidence of pulmonary embolism was cut in half as ace 
		bandages, and then snug stockings, created by Bauer and Black, changed 
		surgical care forever. Today, airline travelers on long flights, with 
		these stockings, no longer have to tramp the aisles, as long as heel and 
		toe exercises, while seated, speed the venous flow and protect them from 
		blood clotting and embolization.<br><br>Everyone and his brother at the 
		hospital were named as authors as the findings were reported, a medical 
		game I with which I would become increasingly familiar, the paper 
		appearing in the New England Journal of Medicine. I was by then in San 
		Francisco, having gone west to my urological residency. My name did not 
		even make a footnote, yet I was surprised that I didn’t really care. 
		Why? Because it was becoming obvious that my parents’ lessons had stuck.<br>
		<br>The lasting satisfaction comes in just knowing you are &quot;effective.&quot; 
		Approval by others was not in my personal equation as I followed my 
		intent, corny as it sounds, to do something for someone each day. As a 
		doctor, how easy this was proving to be. I had made the right choice 
		that day nine years earlier in the Zete House. This first step in 
		Problem Recognition, Solution, and finally being Effective had put me 
		already ahead in the ball game of life, and it provided me with added 
		stimulus to keep following my instincts and to act on them promptly.<br>
		<br>As I think about it and recognize that in my case this partnership 
		of engineering and medicine has seemed so productive, why haven’t the 
		medical schools sought out engineers wishing to be doctors, to fill the 
		roles of bioengineers who can be counted on to ask the &quot;dumb questions?&quot;<br>

		choose a new specialty––Urology<br><br><br><br>As my first year of 
		residency was ending, Dr. Smithwick suggested that I consider another 
		surgical specialty, for in this very hospital the search for a medical 
		cure for hypertension was paying off. That was obvious to me, for in my 
		lab I was testing an American plant extract, Veratrum Veridi, its blood 
		pressure effects being so potent as to be dangerous if not controlled. 
		Other less violent medications were bound to follow.<br><br>Was I 
		disappointed? Yes, for I had had wide experience with the effectiveness 
		of our surgery, many times performed on important Americans. I treasure

		presented to me as he went home, unoperated because of kidney damage 
		associated with hypertension. I remember it as a sad day.<br><br>The 
		triumphs of surgical sympathectomy, although winning the battle, were 
		losing the war. I recall doing a routine physical exam on a twenty-four 
		year old patient being seen in followup. I had become proficient in 
		examining retinas, the window to measure the vascular damage going on 
		all over the body. His retinas, the windows into vascular damage from 
		high blood pressure, were normal. I wondered why I was seeing him as a 
		patient. I then looked into his record. One year earlier his eye grounds 
		were hemorrhagic &quot;Grade 4s&quot;, and a death notice, for his systolic blood 
		pressure was then &quot;malignant&quot; in the 300 range. The Smithwick 
		Splanchnicectomy had won the day. I was convinced of its value, but it 
		was too late. Medical control seemed assured, surgery no longer needed.<br>
		<br>As doors still were open to any surgical specialty, orthopedics and 
		chest tempted me, as their chiefs welcomed this energetic westerner. It 
		was the urologist, Sam Vose, likable as well as famous, who put me on 
		the track I had not before taken seriously, despite the hopes of my 
		Uncle Bert Meads.<br><br>It then occurred to me that Tom Addis would 
		have his way after all, for I had become so familiar with kidneys as I 
		retracted them out of the way in our sympathetic nervous system 
		surgeries. Why not go one step further and repair them as a life work?
		<br><br><br><br>The doors would still be open as to where and how I 
		would practice<br><br><br><br>Uncle Bert Meads wished me to be a student 
		and he the &quot;preceptor,&quot; a practice then accepted by the Urological 
		Boards. But this was no match for the University of California across 
		the Bay. There Dr. Frank Hinman, perhaps the leading urologist in the 
		world, had his residency program. I applied in the face of talented 
		competition. Frank Hinman Jr., I believe, had a say in the decision, for 
		what little contact we had had suggested that he too had the roving mind 
		of an innovator. I was accepted, and the wheel would turn again. 
		Opportunity existed nearby in Boston, but it was time to return to the 
		West, and time for Carol and me to begin our family where future 
		grandparents could be shareholders. The decision was uncontested, save 
		by Bostonians who, when told of our leaving, said only, &quot;Why?&quot; After 
		all, to them, the West was still wild, confirmed a little by the free 
		spirits they had come to know, Carol and Dick.<br><br>We didn’t think 
		our beloved Packard covertible, the Red Bomber, could make it home 
		safely, for it had been without cover and so was traumatized on the icy 
		streets and in the snow. We left it in Boston, its home at the start. A 
		racy, green Pontiac convertible carried us West. We again camped along 
		the way, making the most of our freedom before settling down to family 
		life ahead. Our new home would be upstairs in a new duplex just a few 
		blocks from the Medical Center in San Francisco.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 
		10 <br><br><br><br>UROLOGY IN SAN FRANCISCO<br><br><br><br>Home to 
		California and urological residency<br><br><br><br>My residency began in 
		Franklin Hospital, just over the hill from our apartment. I found myself 
		in another world. Open surgery was still the order of the day, but I was 
		also introduced to the trans-urethral resection of the prostate and the 
		fluid risks it entailed. One of the first instrumental procedures in all 
		of surgery, it required a clear fluid to expose and remove prostatic 
		tissue in pieces rather than as a whole through an incision. This fluid, 
		at even the moderate flow pressure required, could seep into the 
		circulation as bleeding was stanched by electrocoagulation. The fluid 
		could not contain salt, for a short-circuit would occur. Thus, only 
		water could be the irrigant. Therein lay the dilemma. If a fine 
		resection was done as obstructive tissue was removed, the danger of 
		fluid absorption increased. The fluid would be picked up by red cells, 
		making them swell and rupture, their hemoglobin freed and filtered 
		through the kidneys. The hemoglobin would then be concentrated in the 
		excretory tubules, blocking them, with a resulting kidney failure that 
		would require 10 days to repair itself and be able to create urine flow. 
		This time frame was critical to patient survival. The lesion was 
		described as acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or lower nephron nephrosis, 
		likely to be fatal for reasons not then understood.<br><br>As I look 
		back, I still find it hard to believe that I was immediately faced with 
		this problem when a resident’s TURP (Trans-Urethral Resection of the 
		Prostate) did &quot;shut down.&quot; The accepted treatment was to give normal 
		saline (salt at 9 grams per liter) to replace insensible perspiration ( 
		800 cc's ) and anticipate a daily urine output of s 1000 cc's or more. 
		The idea was to &quot;push&quot; the kidney to make urine. This misunderstanding 
		of kidney function could be fatal.<br><br>Thomas Addis’ teaching now 
		came into play. Kidney repair could not be rushed, for it would remain 
		shut down, the patient becoming &quot;anuric&quot; (no urine) or &quot;oliguric&quot; (just 
		a few cc's each day). I searched the medical literature. I was not 
		surprised to find that pulmonary edema (flooded lungs) was the usual 
		cause of death, this being the final stage of heart failure. I had no 
		doubt we were dealing with overload, acute, not chronic as with my 
		Feldman Boston case, and heart failure could be the result.<br><br><br>

		save a life<br><br><br><br>I was now in full charge; the patient was my 
		responsibility. Within hours of surgery, the IV’s were stopped. My 
		problem: I must know his immediate weight, but he could not stand on the 
		scale. Solution: I went to the garage of my Stanyon Street home, revved 
		up my new Shopsmith, a machine that could do everything, and turned out 
		a plywood litter that would fit the large Fairbanks &quot;potato scale&quot; found 
		in every supply room. Effective? You bet it was, and through the years 
		to immediately follow, in the East Bay, I carried the litter in the back 
		of my car, ready to be used in hospital consultations where a Fairbanks 
		Scale was always at hand.<br><br><br><br>I had to promptly decide on a 
		survival plan. I knew that a base need for calories with a patient in 
		bed without any physical exertion is 800 calories per day. Also, I 
		recognized that a gram of protein, as it is metabolized, produces four 
		calories and also creates a half gram of water. A gram of fat would 
		yield 9 calories and a little more than a gram of water. Thus, in round 
		figures, the daily need of 800 calories would be met as 800 cc's of new 
		water was produced. This balanced the insensible perspiration loss of 
		800 cc's, occurring from the lungs with breathing. But there was a 
		catch. The tissue-to-water ratio was changing as tissue was catabolized, 
		changing into energy and waste products, leaving new water that might 
		act as slight overload, something I could not chance. Therefore, he was 
		allowed to lose one pound of body weight per day (about 500 cc's). I 
		would keep him on the dry side. Fluid intake would not be allowed, 
		orally or by vein, until &quot;diuresis&quot; (full urine flow) at 10 days. No 
		patient complaint of thirst could influence me.<br><br>From that day on, 
		every lower nephron nephrosis patient survived, in other hospitals as 
		well, as they asked for help. The circle of cause-to-cure was completed 
		when we wrote the report. My assistant resident, John Huffer, presented 
		the report at the urological meeting in Sun Valley, while I had to stay 
		home and stand guard.<br><br>My third intent, to be effective, was 
		fulfilled as word spread throughout the country. ATN, although to be 
		avoided at all costs, was now tamed, and the TURP was more widely used 
		as it became the standard prostatic operation. <br><br>Later, when I 
		questioned residents as to the importance of body weight control within 
		surgery, I found it accepted as doctrine. No one knew its source. My joy 
		in just being “effective” was reward enough.<br><br><br><br>Fluid 
		electrolyte balance again takes hold<br><br><br><br>The three years of 
		residency was a continuum of my education in clinical body physiology. 
		In private practice, hundreds of times I was called to see patients, 
		often comatose, to later be able to make them well again. This was a 
		whole new world, and it would continue to expand until Dr. Kolff created 
		the first dialysis unit, which was later made smaller and practical by 
		fellow Stanfordite Belding Scribner at Washington University in Seattle. 
		This had plusses that far outnumbered the minuses. My consultive fluid 
		balance practice ended in the mid-1960s. By dialyzing a patient, 
		whatever the fluid-electrolyte imbalance, the machine would correct 
		everything. It still does this today.<br><br>This chapter is really a 
		history of an immense advance in patient care. I will try to illustrate 
		it by events in my learning curve that must have paralleled that of 
		other physicians who, too, found themselves trying to master this new 
		discipline. It was the creation of the flame photometer that made all 
		things possible. It appeared in medical centers about 1947. In another 
		five years it was available everywhere, but it was still something of a 
		curiosity when I came to San Francisco. Therefore, I relied primarily on 
		my own bedside tests, with my bottle of reagents designed by Belding 
		Scribner always at hand. This made it possible for me to make an instant 
		chloride measurement, so valuable in determining the make-up of 
		secretions lost in tubes, bowel leaks as fistulas, and diarrheas. The 
		chlorides in the urine were often critical to a diagnosis and therapy. I 
		could begin treatment almost instantly, not having to rely on the 
		laboratory. In San Francisco, as well as later in the East Bay, 
		photometer readings were slow to be obtained, so I relied on the handy 
		bedside set most of the time, and used the photometer readings as 
		confirmation.<br><br><br><br>Too bad the urine sample was discarded<br>
		<br><br><br>There is always a humorous mistake, which did no harm, but 
		which might have been revealing if it hadn’t happened at all. I had been 
		sent a Kaiser patient with the most serious of congenital 
		lesions––bilateral border-line kidney failure as a probable result of a 
		posterior urethral valve at birth (I will describe this later). A 
		violent diarrhea had resulted from an antibiotic meant to treat his 
		urinary tract infection, to the point that he was desiccated, as 
		infusions could not keep up with the fluid losses. His kidneys were no 
		more than thin shells, and he was only in his late forties! I will never 
		know how he had survived so long. He wouldn’t have, in his boiler room 
		job, had his wife not sent him to work with many thermoses of vegetable 
		and fruit juices each day to slake his thirst. Tom Addis, with his 
		low-protein vegetarian diet, would have approved.<br><br>My job was to 
		rehydrate him, and bring the diarrhea under control. How much potassium 
		did he need and how much was too much? The flame photometer was still in 
		its infancy and we had much to learn about this ion.<br><br>Now to my 
		point. Always the investigator, I tried never to miss the opportunity to 
		learn as I worked on these critical cases. The patient recovered and was 
		to go home. As he walked out of the hospital door, he had a fatal heart 
		attack. I wasn’t so sure that the diagnosis was correct, for this could 
		have been a cardiac arrest from a serum potassium either too low or too 
		high. I had the means to find out, I thought.<br><br>From day one, I had 
		taken a blood sample, spun it to separate out the red cells, and then 
		preserved the plasma. It was as yellow as urine. My intent was to have 
		the overworked photometer measure the potassium levels as I reflected 
		back on the patient’s course. To be sure that the specimens were not 
		forgotten or displaced, I put them in a rack by the lab window. My 
		mistake! I should have written somewhere, &quot;Don’t touch.&quot; Our veteran 
		nurse and trusted mistress of the lab for at least thirty years decided 
		on this very day that the samples were just old urines and should be 
		thrown out. They were, and my rushing to get them was too late. Could a 
		major discovery about the use of potassium have resulted? I will never 
		know, but the correct use of potassium had by then become a passion for 
		me.<br><br><br><br>The principles of potassium replacement and body 
		weight put to the test by daughter Kathy<br><br><br><br>We knew very 
		little about the potassium content of a diarrhea. The first real study 
		of electrolytes in all secretions had just been published by James 
		Gamble. This was a monumental step forward. I rejoiced in it as a 
		winner. A surprise was the high content in the infant garden-variety 
		diarrhea. I put this data to the test in my own home.<br><br>Kathleen, 
		just seven months old, was suddenly taken with an intense watery 
		diarrhea. The possibility of serious dehydration was real. Dr. Jacobs, 
		pediatric professor and friend, took one look and said, &quot;Into the 
		hospital.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No way,&quot; was my retort, &quot;because I will be called in 
		to consult, and I can do this right here at home. I’ll make you a deal. 
		You and I know the danger is not the bug, which you can treat, but the 
		dehydration. If I don’t let that happen, may Kathleen stay home?&quot; He 
		knew of my work with body water and weight, and immediately gave in.<br>
		<br>First I took a sample of the diarrhea to the lab and measured its 
		electrolytes. The surprise was that each liter contained a gram of 
		potassium. This is three to four times the amount found in other bowel 
		secretions. Now, to the library, for I must replace this loss cc. for 
		cc. Again a surprise. Plain skim milk was it, but milk was thought to 
		make the diarrhea worse. So what! I would balance weight and water, for 
		this was my charge.<br><br>Here was our homegrown pattern. Believing 
		that vomiting was likely to occur if we pushed things, I calculated that 
		a teaspoon, no more, every hour night and day would do it. The monitor 
		was her body weight. As long as it stayed within a pound of normal, we 
		were winners. Dr. Jacobs was satisfied. Carol and I played musical 
		chairs, with her on the job during the day, and us sharing the job at 
		night. Weighing was accomplished with our small bedside scale, parents 
		weighing themselves each time, then weighing again holding Kathleen, 
		something any parent can do. Three days did it. Dr. Jacobs volunteered 
		he had never before seen such a rapid recovery.<br><br>The tinkerer’s 
		mind latched on to an obvious corollary: Why don’t pediatricians teach 
		each parent to use weight as a guide when a diarrhea appears, the skim 
		milk regime applied, and the need for hospitalization determined by 
		weight loss? I doubt it has made the manual even today.<br><br><br><br>
		The Leslie affair––Another potassium victory <br><br><br><br>My next 
		potassium challenge patient, a valued PG &amp; E employee, appeared comatose 
		and severely dehydrated after a femoral fracture ten days earlier. It is 
		an axiom that trauma of this magnitude is poorly handled by the male. 
		Bowel peristalsis (contractions) shuts down (ileus), and gastric tube 
		drainage is a necessity until bowel sounds return. His drainage seemed 
		not to have worked, but regardless of my not having a reliable history, 
		Ralph required immediate and dramatic treatment. Intravenous salt and 
		water was the first step, its rate and volume controlled by weight 
		change, as the Fairbanks Scale and my litter became his bedside 
		companion.<br><br>With things for the moment going well, I took Mrs. 
		Leslie aside to ask her what she thought had gone wrong when therapy 
		seemed to be up to code. &quot;Was the tube working well?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Yes, in 
		fact he enjoyed his Cokes,&quot; was her answer.<br><br>&quot;What did you say?&quot;<br>
		<br>&quot;He drank gallons of everything from juices to Cokes to water.&quot;<br>
		<br>The cause was now clear. He had in effect self-dialyzed himself. 
		These solutions would take body water, salt, and potassium with them as 
		they returned through the tube to the drainage bottle. Owen Wangensteen 
		must have been spinning in his grave at such a misuse of his sacred 
		suction tube. But our therapy was now unquestioned. Salt and water 
		coverage we could accomplish over the three days I had allowed for 
		recovery. But potassium was the enigma, for it had been lost as well in 
		the stomach juice, and its aggressive use was still feared by 
		clinicians. What I had most to fear was not a low reading from the lab, 
		but a fatally low T-wave on the EKG (heart tracing).<br><br>At 24 hours, 
		the T-wave started to flatten and disappear. Ralph suddenly woke up too, 
		a coincidence I believed. Potassium was added in high concentrations to 
		the IV infusions immediately. Yet it required another two days for the 
		T-wave to reach its normal contour. Twice as much potassium as salt was 
		infused to return cellular metabolism to normal.<br><br>From that day 
		on, potassium would be my greatest concern. There had to be a better way 
		to give it, for my supplements made up by the pharmacy were crude.<br>
		<br>As a resident, I wasn’t allowed to accept remuneration, but PG&amp;E 
		insisted that there be some reward for returning their special employee 
		to his job. How about a 10-cubic foot refrigerator? After all Carol was 
		an accomplice as she supported my three days at<br><br><br><br>

		Wunder kind” Krupp takes the stage<br><br><br><br>It seems strange, and 
		perhaps even wonderful that the potassium story for all America and the 
		world continued to center right here in the Far West, far from Boston 
		gurus. Marcus Krupp, Stanford internist and a Mentor for me, did 
		something spectacular for potassium as a saver of lives, particularly in 
		areas where the fear of potassium remained. I always believed that our 
		work was complimentary, he developing methods in the University lab, I 
		then putting them to “on the job” use supplemented with my scale and 
		litter, and bedside tests. We both traveled widely in the State to 
		spread the word about this wondrous new science effecting every stage of 
		patient care.<br><br><br><br>What did Marcus do? He designed an ampule 
		encased solution combining potassium with calcium and magnesium, all 
		essential ions lost in secretions. He called it the KMC ampule. It 
		changed the name of the game everywhere. Fear of its correct controlled 
		use dissipated rapidly. The KMC eventually disappeared as solutions 
		appeared primed with potassium now designated as “replacement solutions” 
		as it is today. What made it fool proof was the balancing of calcium and 
		potassium. If the ampule’s contents were by mistake injected into a vein 
		without being diluted in a liter of solution, the dangerous potassium 
		would be neutralized by the calcium. This to me was a remarkable example 
		of a “do it now” innovator being marvelously effective<br><br><br><br>
		Body weight measurements go on hold<br><br><br><br>There was still 
		something missing. Easy and accurate body weight measurement was not 
		discussed. It would have to wait until it would become practical. Was I 
		planning all this? Absolutely not. I had enough on my learning platter 
		to more than fill my days, often with &quot;little things,&quot; so the &quot;big 
		things&quot; must wait.<br><br><br><br>Residency and mentors<br><br><br><br>
		Residency is a wonderful time. Your ever-present and watchful mentors 
		have just one intent–––to draw the very best out of you. There is no 
		time for slackers. One, or even two mistakes could be tolerated in the 
		learning process. A third was &quot;fatal.&quot; These residents were “fired” with 
		the hope that this punishment would be great enough for them to “learn 
		their lesson.” I now doubt they did.<br><br>My first contact with kidney 
		surgery was a surprise. The patient would be turned on the side and 
		strapped in place. The anesthesiologist would then struggle to be sure 
		the compressed lower lung was filled with air. The incision was wide, 
		far wider than I believed necessary, conditioned as I was in Boston. Too 
		many vessels and nerves were encountered, the nerves stripped, and thus 
		later could be sources of severe pain for days, sometimes for years. 
		Postoperative pain required heavy sedation and limited body motion, both 
		detrimental to recovery. Complaining was not my choice, however; 
		somewhere inside the wheels were turning. I would do something about 
		this when the time was ripe.<br><br>Our other surgical procedures seemed 
		to me quite beautiful. Donald Smith was pioneering the repair of the 
		congenital penis deformity, hypospadias, that bound down the organ so it 
		often looked like a female clitoris. Our instruments, the endoscopes, 
		were beautiful as we examined bladders and catheterized ureters to study 
		kidney function. The IVP (intravenous pyelogram), created in Germany, 
		was the glorious standard to see kidneys and ureters clearly. And 
		finally, the Hinman preoccupation with the kidney as the primary focus 
		suited me well, for Tom Addis was always at my shoulder. The PSP 
		(phenolsulfonpthalein) test, which provided information presently 
		obtained with expensive isotope scans, was the backbone. The PSP test 
		has never been surpassed.<br><br><br><br>The PSP test awakening; “do it 
		“<br><br><br><br>One day when I was working at the &quot;pee bench,&quot; Dr. John 
		Schulte, partner with Dr. Hinman and a chip off the old block, passed 
		by. He was just &quot;John,&quot; as I was &quot;Dick.&quot; I remarked, &quot;John, why do we 
		have to do this PSP test on everyone? In Boston it was considered 
		inconsistent.&quot; Without breaking step, John said, &quot;Do it.&quot; By &quot;doing it 
		now&quot; thousands of times, I soon became a believer and its defender.<br>
		<br>What in the end shot it down? The test required four specimens at 
		30-minute intervals. The lab technicians often mixed these up, and the 
		doctor, frustrated by uneven results, ceased to use it. But because a 
		Hinman man always did his own testing, his results were reliable. I 
		learned to require just a single specimen, and found the test consistent 
		and accurate. How I would miss it were I practicing today!<br><br><br>
		<br>Frank Hinman, mentor–––the man and his “eight steps”<br><br><br><br>
		It was evident from the first that I was now part of a unique system, 
		designed by a man easily the world’s authority on many urological 
		problems, especially the kidney that is damaged by obstruction 
		(hydronephrosis). He first worked in the lab with animals, and then in 
		the operating room, testing and proving his theories. If one could be 
		classified as a &quot;genius,&quot; he was that. Which brings me to my point: He 
		was also known for his &quot;eight steps,&quot; a list of things always to be 
		considered before any diagnosis is entertained. And these steps were so 
		simple! In other words, marshal your facts, no matter how obvious they 
		might seem, before even considering a diagnosis. <br><br>This is within 
		the capabilities of anyone no matter his intellectual capacities; they 
		are not complicated.<br><br>1. General history and physical examination<br>
		<br>2. Urological history<br><br>3. Abdominal palpation findings<br><br>
		4. Genitalia examination<br><br>5. Rectal examination<br><br>6. 
		Three-glass urine test<br><br>7. PSP kidney function test<br><br>8. KUB 
		(X-ray of kidneys, ureters, and bladder) <br><br>According to Google 
		this test is now known as the &quot;Valentine Test.&quot; Correction please! It is 
		the &quot;Hinman Eight Steps.&quot;<br><br>There were other rules of conduct. The 
		Hinman system left no room for guesswork. At one monthly presentation, 
		Dr. Hinman as always there, the chief resident presented his case, where 
		a retrograde pyelogram (visualization of a kidney with dye expressed 
		through a catheter) had demonstrated a filling defect in the pelvis of a 
		kidney. It could be a small tumor requiring removal, or just a bubble of 
		air. There was silence as we all waited for the results of a repeat 
		study to be absolutely sure the tumor was really there before operating. 
		That was a cardinal Hinman rule--there would be no guessing. The 
		resident proudly stated that his surgery had removed a true tumor. Dr. 
		Hinman’s comment, &quot;Next case,&quot; eliminated any discussion, and left no 
		doubt that the resident had flunked the guesswork test, and after three 
		years of training! <br><br>The check list was a &quot;natural&quot; for me. On my 
		ward, every patient had a check sheet with his record hanging on his 
		bed. It was therefore so easy not to make a mistake, as my senior 
		resident found when he tried to trap me time and again. He finally gave 
		up, and our friendship deepened through the years. That was because he 
		knew I could be trusted.<br><br>for he knew I could be trusted.<br><br>
		<br><br>The Hypogravic Urine––an inadvertent discovery<br><br><br><br>An 
		11-year old boy with the appearance of an old man was admitted comatose 
		to my ward in the County Hospital. He was obviously severely dehydrated. 
		His kidney tests were those of advanced kidney failure. It took 48 hours 
		to awaken him and gain a history. This episode had been repeated many 
		times, almost since birth. I would later appreciate that Kelly was in 
		reality my first contact with the results of a congenital posterior 
		urethral valve (PUV), the most serious of all congenital lesions. 
		Further, it was still almost unknown to urologists, although Hugh Young, 
		father of Urology at Johns Hopkins, had described it many years earlier.<br>
		<br>But something else was wrong. Every text stated unequivocally that a 
		urine &quot;specific gravity,&quot; or &quot;density,&quot; is always fixed at 1.010 as any 
		type of kidney failure progresses. Kelly’s urine density was not the 
		classic 1.010. It was lower, at 1.004, even though the demands of 
		dehydration were still severe. A normal kidney would attain a urine 
		density as high as 1.036 with this degree of dehydration. What was I 
		missing? Every reading was still 1.004 with my densitometer. To compound 
		my surprise, on a second entry a few weeks later, Kelly’s urine density 
		was even lower, at 1.002, almost water density of 1.000. Kelly died 
		peacefully.<br><br>Now I had a bear by the tail, for tradition was being 
		assaulted. I had best wait for more evidence, but it took another 
		several years to acquire my third case. I published the data with the 
		title of “The Hypogravic Urine,” breaking the rule that all kidney 
		failures could produce only a urine with a specific gravity of 1.010. 
		Was it ever noticed? Rarely! Only one accomplished physiologist noticed 
		the article, and his complimentary report appeared as an editorial in 
		the prime investigative journal, The Journal of Medicine.<br><br>Even 
		today, few urologists and only an occasional nephrologist knows that a 
		density lower than 1.010 in a dehydrated patient signifies 
		&quot;obstruction,&quot; and thus is amenable to urological repair, perhaps life 
		saving, while the 1.010 retains its dire prognosis. Habit, even in 
		science, is difficult to change.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Is it humor or 
		bad luck? I chose humor for Dad and Polaroid <br><br><br><br>My father 
		believed that one should not invest in stocks without having a special 
		expertise in that particular field. The Crash of 1929 served only to 
		make him more gun-shy and not heed his own rules. The rule was, &quot;Don’t 
		invest unless you are familiar with the science involved and the product 
		produced.&quot;<br><br>I heard about a radically new camera and went to the 
		store to examine it. This Polaroid camera was clearly the engineer 
		working with the photographer. I was both. Eastman would not be able to 
		catch up for a long time, I believed.<br><br>I called Dad, defending my 
		use of his rule, and suggested he put in $5,000. No dice! I didn’t have 
		$5,000 to risk, and was concentrating on just the day ahead anyway. Did 
		I miss my calling?<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 11<br><br><br><br>I

		<br><br><br><br>Residency completed, without hesitation I made the 
		choice to pass up opportunity in academia for the privilege of caring 
		for patients one on one. That was a choice I would never regret. I 
		joined Uncle Bert Meads in Oakland, the man who had brought me into the 
		world. How fortunate to have such a natural next step.<br><br>During my 
		year with Uncle Bert I treaded lightly as I continued to learn, for he 
		was truly a master of his trade. He put the final touches on my ability 
		as as a resectionist of the prostate as well as the open surgical 
		perineal prostatectomy, which even today with all of our non-invasive 
		advances is a worthy competitor. However, I am most beholden to him for 
		demanding that I trace every X-ray. In so doing, he was sure I had 
		completed the work-up of each of his patients. I was responsible, as in 
		my residency, for histories and physicals. Uncle Bert was now my 
		mentor–preceptor. But the payoff for me was something else. These traced 
		X-rays served to make me examine carefully each film, the tracing then 
		ending up in the patient’s record. Though not my original intention, 
		these tracings allowed me later to carry on intensive patient studies 
		without having to dig through hospital files each time. What a blessing 
		this habit has been as hospital X-rays have either been destroyed or 
		made difficult to recover on microfilm stored far away. <br><br>I have 
		repeatedly tried to interest residents in this practice. No takers, as 
		they wonder where I have sprung from. Besides, their laptops have it all 
		on the record after all.<br><br><br><br>I move to Berkeley and begin 
		solo practice <br><br><br><br>It was time to be on my own. Berkeley, 
		with its medical community of professor-caliber escapees from the 
		constrictions of academia, seemed to me to be the apex of medical care. 
		It emanated out of Alta Bates Hospital, and was equaled by Oakland’s 
		Children's Medical Center. I couldn’t have been more content, although 
		my practice would grow slowly. My three girls would have the advantage 
		of Berkeley Schools, then top-of-the line, as well as the experience of 
		growing up in an integrated community far ahead of its time.<br><br>
		Practice growth, faithfully graphed in Dad’s fashion, was a straight 
		line, at a new patient per month each month. Only 12 new patients at the 
		year’s end would discourage most starting doctors, but I found the trend 
		consistent, and sure enough, at five years sixty new patients per month 
		were seen. The mix had changed, for children were now appearing in 
		numbers as a new subspecialty was in the making, Pediatric Urology. It 
		was a natural offshoot–-not something really new.<br><br><br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/laurie771.jpg" style="float: left">I 
		teach everywhere<br><br><br><br>Consultations, not strictly urological, 
		had pyramided as fluid-electrolyte balance was emerging as a science. 
		Practitioners were rapidly accepting that they could and must do a 
		better job. The new Academy of General Practice, guided by my neighbor 
		Bill Rodgers, pushed this education. I had to travel. I was happiest, of 
		course, at the wheel of my car. I taught as far away as Palm Desert. It 
		was an exciting time as new knowledge was welcomed. This was especially 
		true as Pediatrics came forward. Hundreds of presentations on such as 
		the pediatric emergency, testicular torsion, focused on work dear to my 
		heart, made possible by Children's Hospital as it encouraged these 
		advances. Those were wonderful days, and I could still be at home and at 
		play with my family. Could anyone ask for anything more? <br><br>Along 
		the way, iconic John Lattimer at New York’s Columbia Presbyterian 
		Hospital asked me to join him as the Professor in the new specialty of 
		Pediatric Urology. It had all the perks–––money, importance, and travel 
		abroad.<br><br>My prompt answer was, &quot;John, I am flattered, but no thank 
		you. I must not miss the most important years in my lifetime with Carol 
		and with my girls as they become women.&quot; I still cherish that decision.<br>
		<br>The tinkerer story goes on. It wasn’t long before I was in over my 
		head, taking patients out of what at times were life-threatening 
		conditions, where ignorance as to the use of fluids and electrolytes was 
		the culprit. Some were sent from far away to Oakland to local surgeons 
		who were still in need of guidance. I would get the call for help, often 
		in the middle of the night. My litter was doing yeoman duty, but I was 
		flagging. Something had to be done to lighten that load, and it had 
		become clear that I was alone in this endeavor. At UC San Francisco, Jim 
		Hopper, a forward-seeing pathologist, had in 1948 acquired a scale from 
		a packing company and had tried to adapt it for the seriously ill. Its 
		size destroyed any chance for success, because it was too large for 
		hospital elevators. Such a little thing can destroy a great idea.<br>
		<br><br><br>The InBed Scale is created<br><br>I must have at hand a 
		practical scale that would be easy for nurses to handle, and be located 
		on each hospital floor. I went to two national scale companies and was 
		promptly turned down. Once again this was nothing new to me. The 
		solution was still entirely in my hands. The engineer took over, for 
		machine shop work in college had been a joy. I located a small machine 
		shop, Acme, on East 14th street in Oakland, and made the necessary 
		drawings. The owner was impressed. Together we went ahead and built the 
		scale by adapting the Fairbanks scale, creating a litter on top that 
		would be non-obtrusive on a ward, and easily moved about. The litter is 
		pulled down in such a way that it would rest on the bed. The scale’s 
		heavy platform slid under the bed for balance. The patient then could be 
		drawn onto the litter as attendants manned the sheets. We called it the 
		InBed Scale. It required only a finish paint job.<br><br>I told the 
		owner that he should get the patent. I saw it as not only of marketing 
		value to the owner but as a teaching tool for nurses to use and in turn 
		educate the physicians as to the new science in the important relation 
		of body weight and water. It did just that. The patent was secured, I 
		later learned. I was content to accept that I was &quot;effective&quot; if the 
		scale would make its way to where it was so badly needed. The 
		fluid-electrolyte science now had wheels. It would get the lubrication 
		of understanding. I was completing the open circle that Owen Wangensteen 
		had created, but it had taken 10 years to accomplish this. The 
		appearance of the scale in Oakland hospitals assured me that it was 
		really on the market. Obviously, sales were taking place. I learned that 
		the InBed Scale was rapidly accepted throughout the country and abroad. 
		It changed fluid electrolyte balance forever. I was &quot;effective.&quot;<br><br>
		<br><br>The Anterior Retroperitoneal Incision is introduced<br><br><br>
		<br>The second innovation needed was in the manner we approach the 
		kidney for any surgery of it or the adrenal gland. As I started 
		practice, I had no choice but to meet the demands of the &quot;Standard of 
		Care&quot; and use the surgery accepted throughout the world. This was the 
		flank incision with the limitations I have already described. I had to 
		be patient, waiting for the unusual patient, who without any doubt would 
		be best served by an operation allowing the supine ( face up) position.<br>
		<br>It took two years of patience. A Chinese American woman, all of 110 
		pounds, required removal of an infection-filled kidney and ureter of 
		tuberculous origin. The flank position was out of the question, for a 
		spill of tubercle bacilli from the upper lung to the lower was an 
		unacceptable risk. The new approach thus could stand litigation, as 
		malpractice lawyers were becoming numerous.<br><br>The Anterior 
		Incision, really an extended Pearl incision with which I was so 
		familiar, coupled with a second small lower right quadrant incision, 
		allowed me to complete the operation in one hour. On the surgical floor 
		at dinner time, my patient had a cigarette or two and a small dinner. 
		Nurses were incredulous. They came in to see the incision to be sure 
		this wasn’t a joke. From that day on, kidney and ureter surgeries were 
		pure joy for me.<br><br>With a dozen successful cases under my belt, I 
		reported on the new procedure, naming it “The Retroperitoneal Incision.&quot; 
		At presentation to the Urological Western Section, it won First Prize 
		for Scientific Advancement. Was it immediately adopted by my profession? 
		Not on your life. It would take much longer than I had anticipated. John 
		Barry, Professor of Urology in Oregon, told me in 1995 that he had just 
		discovered my paper written forty years earlier. The procedure was a joy 
		for him. It made the removal of a kidney for transplant so untraumatic 
		and rapid, it competed well with the longer laparoscopic procedures now 
		in vogue. The almost pain-free postoperative course allowed for early 
		mobilization and early return home.<br><br>The Problem was defined and a 
		solution provided, yet being &quot;effective&quot; was not that easy. Could I have 
		done better by traveling as a Visiting Professor to spread the word? 
		Perhaps, but my day-to-day responsibilities to patients at home denied 
		me that luxury, a small price to pay for such an advance to be in place 
		for years to come. <br><br><br><br>“Stress” brain tumor is a just a 
		&quot;happening,&quot; thankfully<br><br><br><br>All was not peaches and cream. 
		The stress resulting from competing in a specialty well-entrenched 
		throughout the East Bay was part of the bargain. I tried to neutralize 
		it by family hours, physical exertions on the tennis courts, and 
		vacations in the Del Mar surf. But the stress of reality occasionally 
		broke through.<br><br>On coming to Berkeley, one strong incentive was 
		the belief that my training made me competitive. The two urologists in 
		the other Berkeley urology office were firmly ensconced, both having 
		practiced there throughout the war years. How could I break in? I hoped 
		that my years of training with Dr. Hinman would make the difference, 
		while Donald Smith's teaching was already providing the impetus that was 
		making pediatrics an ever-growing part of my practice. Believing I could 
		add something new, I even went to the trouble of making photos with the 
		just-invented Polaroid camera, putting the photos on my consultation 
		notes until, one day, John Blum (my greatest supporter) said &quot;Dick 
		forget it. Just give me the diagnosis and tell me what you want to do.&quot;
		<br><br>One morning as I prepared for surgery at Merritt Hospital, I was 
		hit with a visual blast of &quot;central scotoma&quot;–––sort of a sharp flash of 
		light. My first thought was that I had a brain tumor. And why? Some 
		years before, George Gershwin died at 39 with a brain tumor in the 
		frontal area that correlated sound and music, just as though that area 
		had been overused. And the impression stuck, to the point that 
		subconsciously I could see myself overusing part of my brain to the 
		point of neoplasm. It was a fantasy, of course. I called Dr. John Adams, 
		neurosurgical professor and tennis mate at Cal, to see if I should see 
		him. He laughed, saying he would order skull films if I insisted. I thus 
		learned that stress and the imagination make great bedfellows. The 
		“brain tumor” did not appear. So I continued to think aggressively, 
		thankful I could do so.<br><br><br><br>Frank Lind and Dr. Southey and 
		his &quot;tubes.&quot;<br><br><br><br>I was called to Merritt Hospital by 
		internist Ed Blaisdell to see his father-in-law, in acute trouble from a 
		sudden hypertension of over 300 mm. systolic, which quickly could be 
		fatal to a man in his sixties or older. My IVP (kidney X-ray) showed a 
		smaller right kidney and barely adequate total kidney function. I was 
		proficient with kidney function measurements, which included tests of 
		relative excretion of sodium, chloride, and potassium––a study neglected 
		by most at the time. But no facts could be left out of my Process Mind 
		check list. I proved that the smaller right kidney had a damaged blood 
		supply causing the blood pressure. The small kidney had to be removed, 
		and promptly.<br><br>I did a rapid surgery through the anterior 
		incision. His pressure started to fall while still in surgery. My 
		experience in Boston then paid off as I started a vasoconstrictor, 
		neosynephrine, to hold closed the blood vessels and thus keep the 
		systolic pressure up at 160. He was out of danger, as we allowed time 
		for the circulatory system to adjust and settle down. In the ward, we 
		waited for a few days before decreasing the dosage to zero, while his 
		systolic remained steadily in the 140s. It was safe then to send him 
		home. <br><br>Frank was well for a year. Then I was called again because 
		he had another sudden rise to over 300 mm., and it looked like the jig 
		was up. But again my Boston experience paid off as I started apresoline, 
		a vasodilator, bringing his systolic down to 160 mm. It was held there 
		for several days. We then weaned him off the medication slowly to the 
		point that he stabilized at or below 160, never to rise again. 
		Obviously, some sort of reflex arc involving the sympathetic nervous 
		system had been broken. Boston with Dr. Smithwick echoed.<br><br>Then, 
		things got more interesting. Once the pressure was controlled, he 
		started to retain fluid, some 40 pounds worth, with massively swollen 
		legs, as though in heart failure. But that was not the diagnosis. He 
		also had become resistant to the diuretic effect of Mercuhydrin. It was 
		the only diuretic available then, and it failed. What was I to do?<br>
		<br>I remembered Dr. Addis telling me about Dr. Southey, back in the 
		1800s, placing quills in the swollen legs of his swollen patients, who 
		we now know were in heart failure. He had drawn, should I say &quot;dripped,&quot; 
		away the extra fluids. This was akin to tapping maple syrup from the 
		tree. I would give this a try.<br><br>I cut short “quills” from plastic 
		IV tubing, sharpened them, and placed two in each upper calf. The flow 
		started immediately, almost in spurts. Frank sat with his feet in a 
		large metal wash basin. His legs shrank, while he continued to claim, &quot;I 
		am losing my muscles.&quot; Three days later, forty pounds and twenty liters 
		lighter, now with normal legs, Frank was discharged home. From that day 
		on the diuretic Mercuhydrin was again effective as it removed excess 
		body fluid. He lived another ten years in fine health before a heart 
		attack took him away.<br><br>I had learned once again that a normal 
		water-to-tissue ratio, so named by Marcus Krupp, is essential for 
		physiologic actions to have the greatest chance to be effective. If 
		fluid is in excess, cellular functions are damaged until the balance is 
		restored. The ability of the diuretic Mercuhydrin to work, once the 
		water-to-tissue ratio was normal, speaks for itself. <br><br><br><br>
		CHAPTER 12<br><br><br><br>PEDIATRIC UROLOGY IS PIONEERED <br><br><br>
		<br>My first pediatric challenges––hypospadias and testicular torsion<br>
		<br><br><br>Donald Smith’s training in hypospadias repair set the stage 
		for me to begin my first foray into the new subspecialty of Pediatric 
		Urology without even trying. The second lesion, also congenital, was 
		torsion of the testicle. The envelope around the testicle, the tunica 
		vaginalis, is normally attached in a way that holds the testis in 
		position, acting like the dorsal fin of a fish. If the attachment is 
		faulty, the testicle hangs as if it were a clapper in a bell, and is 
		free to twist as much as 720 degrees. In so doing, blood supply is 
		instantly cut off. Within three hours the testicle could be gangrenous 
		and unsalvageable. The urologist must be always on call, rush to the 
		operating room, and untwist the testicle trying to save it. That was 
		&quot;state of the art&quot; and the &quot;Standard of Care.&quot;<br><br>When called, I 
		responded, always ready to go, no matter the inconvenience. Carol and my 
		daughters understood the need. I began to spread the word to 
		pediatricians and general practitioners. In two years I had seen 14 
		children. I had also made a mistake that led to loss of a testicle, as I 
		had accepted standard texts’ claims that severe pain was the first 
		symptom of torsion, placing swelling in second place. A painless 
		swelling in a 6-year-old was observed too long, and my surgery was too 
		late. This must not happen again. My credo as implied by my Mentor Dad 
		was &quot;One mistake is allowed. A second same mistake is unacceptable.&quot;<br>
		<br>Researching the literature, I was astounded that no case series was 
		greater than three, and nothing helpful was offered. To have 14 cases 
		demanded action and pertinent observations, and I had several new items 
		to offer. On six occasions, after I gained the child’s confidence, I was 
		able to inject one cc. of Novocain into the spermatic cord, making the 
		testicle painless, and I could immediately manipulate it back to normal. 
		In each instance the testicle was saved because I didn’t follow &quot;The 
		Standard of Care,&quot; which demanded I rush to the operating room, expose 
		the testis under anesthesia and then manipulate it. This &quot;emergency&quot; 
		sequence that delays detorsion for up to three more hours, can only 
		increase the danger of gangrene. The value of the cord block cannot be 
		overestimated.<br><br>My next recommendation was to make swelling the 
		prime diagnosis and not count on pain at all. Swelling alone was quite 
		enough. I had found that the younger the child, the less the pain. TUR, 
		Dr. Hinman had warned that the anomaly could be present on both sides. 
		To make sure a viable testis is left, the opposite testis must always be 
		sutured in place, never to twist<br><br>(orchiopexy). Our cases were 
		convincing, for half the time a similar anomaly prone to twist, or 
		&quot;torse,&quot; was found with the opposite testis This demand raised the 
		specter of malpractice suits. I was creating a new &quot;Standard of Care.&quot; I 
		had no hesitation to decide that testis salvage was the issue and it was 
		time to &quot;do it now.&quot; Bilateral exploration and orchiopexies must be 
		mandatory. I hoped for immediate acceptance.<br><br>The report appeared 
		in 1964, not in a urological journal, but in the Journal of the American 
		Medical Association. The word needed to be spread abroad to all 
		physicians, not just urologists and pediatricians. The Problems were 
		clear. The Solutions equally clear. Was I &quot;effective?&quot; The answer is 
		&quot;yes&quot; in one respect. Since that day, bilateral orchiopexy is &quot;The 
		Standard of Care.&quot; Would the diagnosis now be based on just acute 
		swelling of the scrotum with or without pain? I hope this admonition 
		took. <br><br>The use of spermatic cord anesthesia, however, was 
		entirely overlooked for another 30 years. How could this be? I learned a 
		lesson; The compilers of new editions of teaching texts, that are mostly 
		repetitious, usually just transfer the existing reference list without 
		searching out the latest contributions. The spermatic cord block went 
		unnoticed. Thus many salvageable testes were likely lost. Testifying in 
		a court case in Fairfax County near Washington, D.C.L., a few years ago, 
		although I’m retired, my defense of a urologist using the block was 
		successful. As a result the court decided that two &quot;Standards of Care&quot; 
		exist, with the cord block not required in the large teaching 
		institutions where the trip to the operating room was more practical, no 
		matter the price. <br><br>As I examine my actions, I recognize that the 
		lifetime habit of keeping records, then analyzing them as taught me by 
		Dad, with his graphs of trends, was already in place. Particularly 
		valuable turned out to be my crude drawings on every operative note, 
		something Uncle Bert had advised me to do. <br><br><br><br>Acute 
		epididymitis re-visited<br><br><br><br>Infiltration of the spermatic 
		cord with an anesthetic to allow prompt reduction of a testicular 
		torsion had two roots. The first was my experience in Boston where 
		infiltration of the lumbar sympathetic nerves was frequently required. 
		The second was my urological mentor, Dr. Donald Smith, who had 
		effectively employed the cord block for acute epididymitis, where 
		massive painful swelling of the epididymis usually lasted as long as 
		three weeks, despite antibiotics, local heat, and bed rest. Its cause 
		remains unclear, even today. The cord block, more than half the time, 
		resulted in immediate and continued pain control, and a return to a 
		normal scrotum within 72 hours. Instead of weeks off the job, the 
		patient is back to work within days. My experience with the spermatic 
		cord block was just as dramatic. I have considered it a great gift and 
		wondered why others do not know of its existence. An explanation of its 
		action is needed.<br><br>I have mentioned Hans Selye, now immortal for 
		his recognition of the sympathetic nervous system and its actions as 
		instigator of the &quot;Alarm Reaction.&quot; This nervous system has been 
		inherited from the animal, where survival demanded that blood loss be 
		stanched. These fragile nerves are able to constrict the blood vessels, 
		so that clotting can occur and a life be saved. But there is a price, 
		for with injury or inflammation, the lack of oxygenated blood necessary 
		for the healing process is delayed. The spermatic cord block therefore 
		accomplishes two goals–––the somatic nerves that transmit pain are 
		blocked, and scrotal contents can be sensitively palpated. At the same 
		time, the sympathetic nerves are blocked, thus allowing the blood 
		vessels to open, and with their oxygen healing immediately begins, 
		manifested by rapid loss of swelling (edema).<br><br>Google today lists 
		treatments that include bed rest, heat applications, and elevation of 
		the scrotum. Nothing has changed in the 65 years since Donald Smith 
		reported his experience in the 1943 Journal of Urology. I am compelled 
		to try and remedy this oversight by educating both patient and 
		physician. This is the sequence of my learning.<br><br>Henry Bruyn was 
		chief of epidemiology on the UC service at San Francisco's County 
		Hospital. He was studying mumps and its painful complication, a 
		melon-sized swelling of the scrotum known as epididymo-orchitis. He 
		wished to study the fluid that filled the scrotum. Could I obtain it for 
		him?<br><br>I faced a truly miserable patient with a fever of 105 
		degrees. In order to make my needle painless, I injected both spermatic 
		cords with Novocain. Under complete scrotal anesthesia, I then probed 
		and recovered the desired fluid. The next day, Henry called to say, &quot;I 
		think you had better come see your patient.&quot; He made no further comment. 
		My reaction was, &quot;What have I done wrong?&quot;<br><br>I rushed over, to find 
		a smiling man, fever having dropped to normal overnight, with a scrotum 
		no longer painful and well on its way to normalcy. The spermatic cord 
		block had worked again.<br><br>That was my first encounter with the 
		scrotal manifestation of mumps. The second came in private practice, 
		when a young, vigorous professional bike rider came into the office, he 
		too with a high fever, and a painful swollen scrotum. In Phoenix he had 
		been given antibiotics that were not effective. Their diagnosis was 
		acute epididymitis. It was the fever that alerted me, and I took some 
		blood to the lab, asking for a mumps-titer. Ten days later, this 
		diagnosis was confirmed.<br><br>I injected the spermatic cord in order 
		to carefully palpate the scrotal contents and rule out a torsion, while 
		at the same time he was receiving my standard treatment for acute 
		epididymitis. The next day he was pain-free, without fever, and his 
		scrotal swelling resolving. He promptly went back on the road to meet 
		his training schedule.<br><br>In the mid-1960s I was making rounds at 
		Presbyterian Hospital in New York with the residents and their chief, 
		Dr. Keith Waterhouse. His recent passing makes him a legend, for his 
		inquiring mind–––likely to be Process–––never stopped searching for a 
		better way to do things. I saw a patient sitting up in bed, his enlarged 
		scrotum draped with hot poultices. It had to be a full blown acute 
		epididymitis, the patient suitably miserable.<br><br>With Keith's 
		assent, I said, &quot;Please bring me a small syringe and some Xylocaine.&quot; I 
		injected several cc's into the spermatic cord. I mentioned to the 
		residents that the same injection in a patient with torsion would allow 
		its immediate correction. In the mail, one week later, came a Polaroid 
		photo of this patient with a broad smile as he left the hospital. Keith 
		Waterhouse made sure that the value and technique of spermatic cord 
		block was taught each resident through the years. It was such a resident 
		who led to my appearing in court in his behalf when he had attempted by 
		cord block to save a testicle and was able to immediately reduce the 
		torsion.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Busy days<br><br><br><br>Our Berkeley 
		home was a four-story stucco Victorian building with a tennis court, a 
		bit small, but great for a neighborhood playground. It was built by 
		&quot;Hungry Peterson&quot; to house his eight children, somehow sired between 
		long trips to and from the Arctic in his four-masted merchantmen. The 
		house was like the inside of his ships, walled with dark mahogany, and 
		the upstairs family room was a small replica of a ship’s forecastle. The 
		many stairs kept Carol in shape, and each of the three girls had her own 
		room.<br><br>I had maintained close ties to Donald Smith, UC Urology 
		department chief, when he did a strange thing. He cancelled his urology 
		classes, assigning their 20 hours to me to teach fluid-electrolyte 
		balance to third-year students as a new subject in the curriculum. Over 
		two years I had these hours with all of the third year students. A 
		syllabus was required, and somehow, in the wee small hours of the night, 
		I completed it. We sent it east for possible publication, but it was 
		summarily turned down: it was just too &quot;simple&quot; when judged by the 
		&quot;experts,&quot; a problem I have met many times and never overcome. My 
		students seemed to lap up this uncomplicated approach, particularly when 
		one of the insufferably &quot;smart&quot; students would take me on, to be 
		demolished as I let him shoot himself in the foot as his own ignorance 
		of the subject was exposed. <br><br>Now I look back in awe. Where did 
		the time and energy come from to combine this activity with private 
		practice and home life? I have since concluded that it was made possible 
		by the &quot;energy&quot; created by enthusiasm. Others might call it passion. 
		Nevertheless, for the next years, the trips across the Bay were many as 
		I taught, and at times operated on a patient with a special problem. 
		These surgical episodes were not to my liking, because I couldn’t be at 
		hand every moment, and had to count on residents to do the right things. 
		I never overcame the fear that I might not be there when needed. How 
		wonderful in Berkeley to be minutes away from every patient!<br><br><br>
		<br>Distal Urethral Stenosis––-the &quot;Irritating&quot; Distal Urethral Ring<br>
		<br><br><br>As the pediatric practice grew, I was almost overwhelmed 
		with little girls who seemed miserable with their voiding difficulties 
		and wet underwear. When an infection was not found, the problem appeared 
		insurmountable as pediatricians and psychologists gave up, placing these 
		youngsters at my door. The problem spoke for itself. I must search for a 
		solution.<br><br>Why not start at the beginning and have the girls show 
		me what the problem was, for a child’s ability to list symptoms beyond 
		saying &quot;my bottom hurts&quot; or &quot;my tummy hurts&quot; is not much help. Why not 
		study their flows. What better way to do it than in the isolation of the 
		bathroom, there to record their flows on a tape recorder? In academia 
		others were placing catheters in frightened children and measuring 
		pressures in bladder and urethras, a true representation of what was 
		really going on quite impossible. Fear and discomfort would deform any 
		finding. I would, in my way, keep things simple, comfortable, and 
		unobtrusive. A potty hanging in the toilet, its sounds dulled by the 
		plastic, proved ideal. Thus was born the Piddle Patterns that the name 
		Lyon would be associated with as the years went by. How often has 
		someone said, &quot;Oh, you’re the Piddle Pattern Man.&quot; If that had a 
		demeaning intent, I took it otherwise. It‘s good to be remembered one 
		day with a smile.<br><br>The recorder piled up roll after roll of tape, 
		and I listened over and over and over again. Eventually, I could 
		recognize just three distinct patterns of voiding. One, the &quot;Normal,&quot; 
		was so rare in practice that I had to depend on my three daughters for 
		examples. The force of flow varied, but the smooth pattern without 
		terminal dribbling was unmistakable. Later, to test this belief, on a 
		Labor Day weekend, we had cookies and drinks for the little girls in our 
		neighborhood who happily made piddle patterns in the seclusion of the 
		bathroom. Low and behold these were all &quot;Normal&quot; too, confirming my hope 
		that the recordings were valid and thus the children heard in my office 
		with other patterns definitely had serious problems.<br><br>The 
		&quot;Hesitant&quot; pattern was the rule for those girls with tummy aches, damp 
		underwear, irritated perineums, and just downright unhappy, disturbed 
		personalities. The Hesitant is a slow start, as if by straining, with a 
		continuous irregular flow, always with a slow finish and terminal 
		dribbling. And this flow did not vary when repeated.<br><br>The third 
		and final pattern I termed &quot;Intermittent&quot; for it is a series of sharp 
		starts and stops, almost squirts, as if the bladder was fighting a 
		series of involuntary sphincter muscle contractions. If I would then 
		check for urine left behind (the residual) there was always enough urine 
		left in the bladder to invite infections, unlike the Hesitant streamers. 
		These children would be my most difficult challenges, for infections 
		were persistent. Fortunately there were just a few.<br><br>Would 
		voiding-cystourethragrams (X-rays of dye-filled bladders), something I 
		was able to achieve consistently at cystoscopy time, be a help 
		diagnostically? Our Hospital anesthesiologists were probably the best in 
		the world. They could provide light enough anesthesia that would allow 
		voiding. It would be done as anesthesia was induced. There were four 
		urethral outlines, all with terminal narrowing but nothing diagnostic 
		save the rare one demonstrating a thin line as the muscle went into 
		severe spasm even during anesthesia. The voiding-urethragram was of 
		value in one respect. It was obvious that the child’s urethra itself was 
		large enough, almost adult size, that it would not be stretched by a 
		large endoscope, yet I was bothered by not recognizing something that 
		was causing the difficult urination. <br><br>When I correlated sign, 
		symptoms, voiding patterns and infections on my muti-columned spread 
		sheets, it was time to report on this form of urodynamics as a 
		diagnostic reality. I went south to the newly appearing Pediatric 
		Society urology meetings. I was sure that the presentation would elicit 
		every kind of reaction from laughter to disbelief. Sure enough the 
		titters began when I identified my daughters’ streams as the Normals, to 
		follow with the Hesitant and Intermittent examples. I was prepared for 
		instant derision. I must not react. It was just that, not taken 
		seriously by the many. However, as I left at the meeting’s end, two 
		professors of urology stopped me to say &quot;Dick, keep it up, You’ve got 
		something.&quot; The first was John Lattimer from New York, and the second, 
		Willard Goodwin of UCLA. Their agile open minds had made them &quot;giants.&quot; 
		Did their encouragement make a difference? Yes, they confirmed something 
		I was going to pursue anyway. Was I &quot;effective?&quot; I guess so, if being 
		the &quot;Piddle Pattern Man&quot; is an indicator of success, yet not the only 
		success I would have wished.<br><br><br>Now this story takes a new 
		twist. Fate, or serendipity, then stepped in the door. Some years 
		before, surgeon Sumner Evringham had presented me with a handsome 
		leather-bound box containing silver Bougies à Boulé. The box had been on 
		my desk for months as I wondered how they could be useful. The bougies 
		looked like turnips of different sizes, each at the end of a thin rod. 
		They were made in France to be used to locate scars (strictures) in the 
		male urethra caused by the venereal disease, gonorrhea. I kept wondering 
		if I could find some use for them.<br><br>Dr. Brad Young in San 
		Francisco believed the girls’ voiding problems, often leading to 
		infections, were the result of a tight and thick bladder neck. He 
		advocated doing a YVplasty, the same operation I had introduced while a 
		resident, for the closed bladder neck of my first adult patient with a 
		posterior urethral valve. Why not take these bougies, pass them through 
		the urethra into the bladder, and see if, by &quot;feel,&quot; I could verify that 
		the bladder neck was truly thick?<br><br>Surprise! Only the smallest 
		bougie would pass all of the way to the bladder. The next larger size 
		snapped through something just within the urethral opening (meatus). 
		This &quot;something&quot; felt like a thin membrane, much like the pre-pubertal 
		hymen. I turned to the anatomy texts. No such structure was described. 
		It would have to be called a &quot;discovery.&quot; The next step one would term 
		an &quot;adventure.&quot; It was logical to believe this membrane was obstrucing 
		flow. I applied Bernoulli’s theorem relating flow to orifice size and 
		pressure. The smallest opening in the membrane allowed a normal flow. 
		Something else was producing the hesitant and intermittent streams. It 
		had to be the muscular urethra, contracting in response to the 
		irritation the membrane must be causing.<br><br>It was then that I 
		recalled mentor John Schulte had reported a striking case of a little 
		girl whose symptoms were those I have just described. He had dilated her 
		urethra aggressively, supposing that the scarring by a stricture was the 
		problem. She was cured! Had John used the bougies given me, he would 
		have made the same discovery years earlier. The membrane must be 
		inactivated.<br><br>With my patient anesthetized, I started with an F 10 
		sound (cigar-shaped metal dilator), noticed resistance with an F 16, F 
		18, F 20, F 22. With F 24, something gave way! F 26 and F 28, then 
		unresisted, fell in. The membrane had split at F 24! A drop of blood 
		appeared; the job was done.<br><br>Until the next office visit a week 
		later, I was on my guard. No phone calls, so things must be okay. On her 
		first visit, only a few days later, my little patient ran down the hall 
		toward me asking for &quot;my cookie,&quot; a wide smile having displaced the 
		concerned frown the week before. Her piddle pattern was now normal! I 
		knew the game was won. Mom was in tears of joy, because now she knew 
		that she and her husband were not causing the problem. <br><br>What was 
		I to call this membrane that acted as an irritant, its lumen almost 
		never so small that a normal flow could not occur. It wasn’t 
		&quot;obstructive.&quot; The urethral muscle above must be the constricting agent. 
		I believed it was involuntary and responding to the irritation of the 
		Ring as it narrowed the flow, much as an anal fissure would produce 
		string stools. Its consistency and location suggested similarity to the 
		pre-pubertal hymen which softens at puberty. I named it The Distal 
		Urethral Ring; the syndrome, Distal Urethral Stenosis. The membrane is 
		likely to soften and perhaps disappears at puberty, but by then the<br>
		<br>psychological impact remains, as some women are bothered by a 
		nagging urgency and frequency through later years.<br><br>One thousand 
		unhappy little girls had their Ring membranes broken. In only a few was 
		an immediate dramatic change not the rule. Teachers called parents to 
		find out what had happened, for their students had stopped fidgeting, 
		seemed no longer preoccupied, and stopped suddenly running to the 
		bathroom. Grades sky-rocketed as attention spans became normal. 
		Constipation disappeared. Even tiny tots could be fed as they stopped 
		fidgeting. One would think that the problem was solved, yet being 
		&quot;effective&quot; was another matter.<br><br>Today the procedure is known, and 
		yet used only by a few, and they may be under pressure for the reasons I 
		will describe. To me it is a monstrous mistake, as it denies quick 
		effective treatment on a spurious basis. I will explain.<br><br>The 
		decade following the publication of my findings and results was marked 
		by ready acceptance, some 20 papers reporting similar results, 
		emphasizing remarkable rates of infection cure. There were always a few 
		who, perhaps seeking prominence, took a negative view. They claimed the 
		Distal Urethral Ring was not &quot;obstructive.&quot; It never was claimed to be 
		obstructive! Clearly the critics had chosen not to seriously study the 
		report and thus, perhaps playing politics, diverted the issue. <br><br>
		<br><br>Distal Urethral Stenosis at 21<br><br><br><br>In the operating 
		room I was preparing for the simple process of inactivating a Distal 
		Urethral Ring membrane in another little girl, miserable with her 
		mysterious problem. The X-ray technician said, &quot;Dr. Lyon. You tell these 
		wonderful stories about what you are doing. Do you think you can help 
		me?&quot;<br><br>This was her tale. Her marriage was at risk because of a 
		lifetime habit of having to void every hour day and night. To me this 
		seemed unbelievable to have gone uncared for until now. I said, 
		&quot;Margaret, please come to my office and I’ll see if I can discover the 
		problem.&quot;<br><br>With her urethra anesthetized with Xylocaine, my Bougie 
		a Boulé struck a resistant Ring just within the urethral opening (the 
		meatus). Its caliber was a very small f 16, probably unchanged from 
		girlhood. It had not softened with time. The caliber was large enough to 
		allow for a normal flow, but its irritant effects seemed still to be in 
		place. The endoscope disclosed a perfectly normal bladder, save for its 
		small capacity of only 100 cc's. No wonder the urinary frequency, but 
		was the small capacity bladder the cart or the horse?<br><br>To see 
		someone with a persistent Ring in their twenties was a unique experience 
		for me. I said, &quot;Let’s go for broke. Grit your teeth for a moment as I 
		rupture the Ring.&quot; <br><br>It gave way at F 26 in classic fashion, just 
		as with the very young. Margaret came back in a week, smiles broader 
		than ever. &quot;I sleep all night and go to the bathroom two or three times 
		a day. Thank you so much.&quot;<br><br>Her bladder capacity had within the 
		week increased to a normal 300 cc's. The Ring was obviously the horse, 
		and the bladder the cart. My beliefs about the Ring as just being an 
		irritant setting off the urge to void was again confirmed.<br><br>The 
		story should end here, but several months later Margaret appeared with a 
		bladder infection, clearly after intercourse. I said, &quot;Margaret now that 
		you are like the rest of us, you must drink two big glasses of water 
		after each intercourse so that your now normal bladder, filling up 
		rapidly, will awaken you before the bacteria can multiply, and will 
		flush out the critters.&quot; She did that and lived happily ever after, I am 
		told.<br><br>Without my trusty bougies to identify the Distal Urethral 
		Ring membrane, I would have tried a urethral dilatation as John Schulte 
		did the manner used so successfully for adults. I would never have known 
		that it was just a Distal Urethral Ring that gave way. Over the years I 
		discovered, with the bougies, over 20 adults with Rings still intact who 
		responded to the single dilatation. However, with urgency and frequency 
		habitually in place, they never quite duplicated the success of 
		Margaret.<br><br><br><br>Professors of pediatric urology are created in 
		America<br><br><br><br>An unexpected transition occurred as Pediatric 
		Urology was being pushed as a separate specialty by those in the 
		residency programs who did not share the view of the older, experienced 
		urologists. We believed that by extending standard procedures to the 
		very young we were just broadening the specialty field. Everyone agreed 
		that a year in England with Mr. David Williams at St. Ormond Childrens 
		Hospital in London and with Mr. Herbert Johnston in Liverpool would be 
		valuable, for the numbers of patients seen in these two institutions 
		were enormous. (The English surgeon is a Mr., not a Dr.). But something 
		was amiss. It was true that all of the pediatric procedures our American 
		&quot;Fellows&quot; would witness in England were of American origin. Was this why 
		David Williams chose to belittle America’s latest offering, Distal 
		Urethral Stenosis? Was the cure so simplistic as to be unbearable when 
		it had been missed for so long by the &quot;experts?&quot; Be that as it may, 
		David Williams chose to deny any discussion of any therapy directed at 
		little girls’ urethras.<br><br>I spent two days with him. In clinic we 
		saw some sad cases of neglect and many of acute need. On my first day 
		there, a 9-year-old came in with the signs and symptoms of DUS, a mild 
		complaint compared to those I had just seen. She was promptly scheduled 
		for the operating room the next day. I was astounded and said, &quot;Isn’t 
		this problem too minor to be a competitor for operating time. What will 
		you do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I will take a look.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And see what?&quot;<br><br>
		&quot;I’ll see something.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Will you use your largest scope, for 
		instance, an F 26?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes.&quot; He would break the Ring membrane, with 
		his observers, our American urologists as Fellows, none the wiser.<br>
		<br>The new cadre of professors-to-be came home thoroughly convinced 
		that the DUS syndrome was a hoax. They returned to pills, invasive 
		urodynamics tests, and psychological help. It is the same today, forty 
		years later. Can I do something about this? I am still trying, for the 
		conscientious pediatric urologist is missing each day the joy of being 
		effective. <br><br><br><br>Chapter 13 <br><br><br><br>THE CHANGING WORLD<br>
		<br><br><br>My practice grows; I tire; I gain a partner<br><br><br><br>
		It would seem I had quite enough on my platter, but each day brought 
		with it something else that had to be considered in the mix that was 
		beginning to take place. The three girls were growing up. I was still 
		practicing solo. Our summer vacations, riding the waves in La Jolla and 
		Del Mar lengthened, as I found practice fatigue expressing itself in the 
		number of weeks it would take for me to relax and become sleepy during 
		the day. First it was one week, then two, then three. When it reached 
		four, I got the message and looked for a partner. My first choice failed 
		to meet my criteria for honesty. That association lasted just a year. as 
		I became wary of my ability to judge people. I practiced by myself for 
		another three years.<br><br>Don Smith again proved a savior when he sent 
		Sumner Marshall as ideal for the job. Sumner and I were a match, and 
		though we later had several other partners come and go, Sumner and I 
		were simpatico to the day I retired, leaving him to then carry on our 
		traditions.<br><br><br><br>I do my part in a changing Berkeley world, 
		with home and family taking precedence<br><br><br><br>The most pressing 
		problem was to recognize the changes taking place in this Athens of the 
		West. Our first decade in Berkeley was as we expected it would be. Alta 
		Bates Hospital was possibly the finest in the world, for its nurses were 
		incomparable, and its medical staff immensely talented men who turned 
		down enticing academic careers, and who, like me, loved the well-rounded 
		life Berkeley offered. Weather, of course, played its part. There was no 
		mediocre medicine or surgery at Alta Bates, and my innovative forays 
		were accepted and encouraged. In other words, ambition and envy simply 
		did not exist, and the pathology and radiology departments were second 
		to none, led by physicians who shared their pride. <br><br>The first 
		step away from Athens was suggested to me a number of years ago by Dr. 
		John Saunders, the accomplished anatomist at UC Berkeley. He had become 
		Chancellor of the University for just long enough to assure the 
		resignation of President Clark Kerr, who seemed not to understand the UC 
		Berkeley conflicts. Dr. Saunders told me that in the late 1950s he 
		sensed the changes to come when he noticed that the city no longer 
		enforced ordinances related to housing. The doors were thus opened for 
		the outside to move in, and live not as families but as communes.<br>
		<br>Then the UC bandwagon appeared, subtly at first, as civil servants 
		and university professors moved in from the outside, primarily from New 
		York City. They knew that they were joining an academic world of immense 
		acceptance and tolerance, and that they could direct change in such an 
		uncritical atmosphere. Two years later, I accosted such a professor who 
		was leaving to return to New York. He explained, &quot;because I can’t get my 
		children educated.&quot; What a change from the school system my oldest 
		daughter, Kathy, had known, and my two younger daughters, Joan and 
		Laura, were just recognizing as failing. <br><br>Politics had entered in 
		in the form of &quot;busing&quot; when Mr. Sullivan came to Berkeley from New 
		England, courtesy of a progressive school board. He would take over the 
		schools as superintendent with the apparent intent to have busing in 
		place by presidential election time. I believe that this was the first 
		major busing program in the country. I was so concerned about the 
		$600,000 to be diverted from such uses as more and smaller classes in 
		the black neighborhoods, that I presented my feelings to the Board in 
		the high school auditorium. Black and white citizens filled the room. I 
		criticized the whole busing concept as counterproductive to a remarkable 
		education program already in place. My comments were received with loud 
		applause. Perhaps I knew my community better than most.<br><br>At that 
		time, Berkeley must have been leading the nation in its devotion to 
		educational advances. Our first six grades in the black neighborhoods 
		were receiving the heaviest financial backing. With smaller classes, 
		but, more importantly, with proximity to homes, parents came into the 
		classrooms for direct participation. As I pointed out to new 
		superintendent Sullivan, this family involvement would end when a child 
		is bused to far off parts of Berkeley, all for the sake of diversity. 
		Parents could no longer be close at hand. Nevertheless, busing was 
		implemented. With the passing of Robert Kennedy, the next January found 
		Mr. Sullivan back in Massachusetts at some promised job, leaving us left 
		with this misadventure from which our city never recovered. <br><br>
		Before Mr. Sullivan, geography dictated that schools served their 
		neighborhoods. The first six grades seemed segregated, but the reward 
		was closeness to home and family participation. This appeared to be a 
		racial separation. The fact is that this separation was primarily on an 
		economic basis. Once the children reached the seventh grade, they came 
		together, fully prepared to compete as ethnic lines blurred. The diverse 
		population at Willard Junior High School on Telegraph Avenue and at 
		Berkeley High School was a joy to behold, as well as be a participant 
		in. Ethnic lines gave way to social and cultural capabilities. My girls 
		felt perfectly at home in the school room or at the school proms.<br>
		<br>Then the political system got further into the act. Here was 
		democracy being grossly misused by the few, and Berkeley was not worldly 
		enough to recognize the invasion. Our unquestioning tolerance, always a 
		danger in a free culture, did not recognize the discipline that 
		democracy requires to survive. <br><br>I invited a dozen or so citizens 
		to have breakfast at the hospital on each Wednesday. In a few months, 
		the result was the creation of a working group known as Concerned 
		Berkeley Citizens (CBC). It knew no party lines. This group functioned 
		for the next three years, interviewing candidates for the City Council, 
		and then acting to elect their choices. I believe I was the only 
		registered Republican in the group, though the larger group to follow 
		may have had a few such as General William Dean, famed as a prisoner for 
		his years of survival in solitary confinement in Korea.<br><br>The 
		election of 1966 followed our hopes, and the election of 1968 seemed to 
		be on the same track. All of the chosen candidates represented a broad 
		base from liberal to moderate. Our candidate, Bill Sweeney, highly 
		respected judge of Afro-American heritage, seemed destined to be the 
		next mayor. Suddenly, out of the blue, appeared John De Bonis, a 
		blustering past-councilman with solid backing from a group known as the 
		BCU––Berkeley Citizens United––a long-time, semi-active group made up of 
		5,000 older citizens, who, on the surface, would seem to be 
		ultraconservative. My protestations to them that their 5,000 votes would 
		doom our more moderate approach reached deaf ears, and the result was a 
		loss to a &quot;progressive&quot; candidate by only 2,000 votes. Thus, the 
		critical turn was not accomplished by an advancing liberal agenda, but 
		by a shortsighted older Berkeley citizenry who wouldn’t believe what was 
		happening as democracy was subverted. <br><br>At the same time, I had 
		adopted another line of direct action. Some forty business and 
		professional citizens came to my home to see what could be done. The 
		result was that all agreed to my request for participation, the only way 
		left with a hope of being effective. All agreed to attend monthly city 
		council meetings for one year. Twenty did. As it turned out, this didn’t 
		work either. Perhaps there is an explanation as to why.<br><br>The young 
		rebels, the &quot;Chicago Seven,&quot; showed up in Berkeley, having traveled from 
		Columbia to Michigan State and to UC Berkeley, as the airplane made them 
		seem to be everywhere. The result was that we Berkeley citizens were 
		ineffective, student discontent raging and threatening the serenity we 
		prized, which was quickly lost. How, in a major city, could this happen?
		<br><br>We were sitting ducks, with great ideals, generosity supported 
		by beliefs that took democracy for granted, but this inertia of apparent 
		success made us vulnerable to the small groups that would subvert these 
		ideals.<br><br>There was a second contribution. A city the size of 
		Berkeley usually has leaders of industry who also are leaders in public 
		life. Berkeley had such potential leaders, but they considered Berkeley 
		just a delightful place to live. Their offices were in San Francisco, 
		and there they exerted their leadership. This absence of direction was a 
		telling blow.<br><br><br><br>Governor Reagan rescues Berkeley for a 
		moment<br><br><br><br>When things were at their worst, after a physical 
		confrontation on Telegraph Avenue between angry students and the 
		Sheriff's department, I was crossing Shattuck Avenue and ran into Police 
		Chief Biehl. I had met with him each Friday for months to try to be 
		supportive. He was ashen. I asked if he was going to have a heart attack 
		or perforate an ulcer. He said that he had reason to, because &quot;Telegraph 
		Avenue was about to blow,&quot; gunfire and all, and he hadn't been able to 
		get help from the State. I said, &quot;See you later,&quot; and went to the pay 
		phone nearby. It was Friday afternoon when public officials often had 
		left for the weekend. I put in my nickel, and by sheer good fortune 
		found Don Mulford, our state representative in the office and on the 
		phone. I said &quot;Don, if you don't get Governor Reagan to do something, 
		Berkeley will blow up and you will be to blame.&quot; Click! In force, the 
		State Highway Patrol sped by me on Shattuck Avenue Avenue ten minutes 
		later. The city remained quiet. Again it was great to be &quot;effective.&quot;<br>
		<br><br><br>The Gerwick-Lyon-Nixon story.<br><br><br><br>This next 
		account has particular reference to my attempts to reach Bill Gates with 
		an equally far-out idea, and again meet failure. The value of telling 
		this story is to emphasize how little things may effect change over 
		time, as long as one is persistent. These next two adventures occurred 
		forty years apart.<br><br>In the year that John Kennedy and Richard 
		Nixon were sparring, engineer Ben Gerwick, pioneer in underwater 
		construction, and I talked together about what America might do at the 
		world level. Our basic agreement led to a letter, two pages in length, 
		that we composed on a Sunday evening at the Berkeley Tennis Club.<br>
		<br>We both believed at that time that America was searching for a way 
		to spread its largess into the undeveloped world. We focused on South 
		America. As I look back, it was a barometer of the world and its 
		shrinkage, because the Middle East was not considered. We envisioned 
		sending teams of experienced experts to any country wishing to solve a 
		specific problem, such as education in a town. Ben and I saw this as 
		complex, for an efficient school needs more than four walls and a 
		teacher. It requires pure water, sanitation, sewage disposal, etc. So 
		our teams were to be the heads of successful organizations, and willing 
		to do this in close-knit groups. As a starter, it would be a two-year 
		assignment, and payment would be on the same scale as received in their 
		own businesses.<br><br>We placed this note in the pocket of Stan 
		McCaffery, a right-hand man to Nixon, and a close friend of ours. We 
		expected him to give it to Mr. Nixon on his visit to California, but 
		nothing happened. Oddly, we never complained to Stan about this because 
		the next time we saw each other it was too late, and why demand an 
		excuse?<br><br>In September of that year, I believe, the Youth Corps 
		concept was adopted by John Kennedy. When I went to the hospital, 
		friends stopped me to say that our plan had been purloined. My answer 
		was that this was not the case, and the new plan had to come from 
		somewhere else. I also felt it inadequate, for it placed amateurs in 
		positions requiring pros. At the same time, it would have immense appeal 
		to the young electorate and would give American youths a great 
		experience. The election hung on a few votes. I have always believed the 
		Youth Corps made the difference.<br><br>The next January, a young man 
		named Bill came into my office with a refractory ailment picked up in 
		South America. Could I cure it? Yes, and it was not difficult to do. 
		When I asked him what he had been doing there, he said &quot;Fore-running the 
		Peace Corps.&quot; I showed him our plan, and he had to smile, for their 
		original plan was much like ours. When I asked who financed the project, 
		he said, &quot;Mr. Watson of IBM.&quot; I don’t know whether this was Jr. or Sr., 
		but I did know that Mr. Watson had voted as a Democrat, although he was 
		known as a staunch Republican, My next question was, &quot;Didn’t Mr. Watson 
		give this to Mr. Nixon first?&quot; The answer was &quot;Yes, but Nixon turned it 
		down.&quot;<br><br>That was in June, I suspect before our proposal arrived, 
		and Stan had believed it to be a lost cause. The final note is that Bill 
		became head of the Youth Corps later, so this tale hangs beautifully 
		together.<br><br>I wonder how different things might be now, if Richard 
		Nixon had possessed the imagination and vision of John Kennedy?<br><br>
		<br><br>I try again, this time for Iraq<br><br><br><br>Mr. President:<br>
		<br><br><br>First, may I introduce myself. I am a retired urologist who, 
		as president of the Napa World Affairs Council some years ago, with my 
		wife Carol was privileged to have Dr. Condoleezza Rice as our dinner 
		guest. We knew then that Dr. Rice was on her way into American history, 
		and now you are so fortunate to have the vision to have her at your 
		side. For three years, on the Internet, I have been mentoring pediatric 
		surgeons in Pakistan, India, and Rumania, teaching them the processes of 
		urology. They must care for all children, regardless of diagnosis, in a 
		struggling world of such poverty we can’t imagine. And thus, I see 
		America’s mission as so much broader than providing sustenance and 
		safety, the stability of education being the greatest need. So, I have a 
		thought.<br><br>In Iraq, as well as in all of the Middle Eastern 
		countries, the present and the future lies in the hands of the 
		young–––those now wielding instruments of death. Yet these angry 
		feelings could give way quickly to a feeling of personal worth. Can we 
		do something about this? Though my belief is exotic and on the surface 
		unachievable, the message remains the same. I tried to reach Steve Jobs, 
		for I remember his foray with the Apple into the schools, surely 
		expensive at the moment, but a stimulus to the communication world he 
		was helping to build. So, my thought is this. If a computer, whether by 
		Apple, Compact, Dell, or the Gates Foundation, as an American venture 
		were to find its way into each Iraqi schoolroom, not tomorrow, but now, 
		as things hang on a knife edge, a healing process would be in place. 
		Some object with, &quot;but Iraqis don’t speak English.&quot; My answer is, &quot;Put 
		the kids’ Fedayeen-fingers on a computer keyboard connecting with a new 
		friend in America, and those boys will be computer fluent in 
		word-processed English in a matter of weeks to a few months. Their guns 
		will rust.&quot; What makes this venture so inviting is that computers will 
		malfunction or be broken, while available to every classroom will be a 
		young American GI, fluent in computerese and maintenance, and anxious to 
		help.<br><br>Yours truly,<br><br>Richards Lyon, MD<br><br>That was my 
		message. I expected it not to be taken seriously, but I must try. It was 
		2003, and I was anxious to push this concept hard, hoping to break 
		through and make it not only a truly wondrous human step, but one with 
		political implications. Again I failed, despite almost a year of 
		following up by letter, phone, and e-mail, every possible lead, which 
		included industrial and government leaders of both political parties. I 
		heard not a word until a single note came from the White House with just 
		“Thanks.” <br><br>If you believe in it, go for it. If it doesn’t work, 
		you’ve tried and tried, like the Puffer Billy, and it may be &quot;effective&quot; 
		without your knowing it.<br><br><br><br>Levity in a serious life–––the 
		asparagus fiasco<br><br><br><br>I have always been fascinated by the 
		odor of asparagus (aspergine) in urine within an hour of its ingestion. 
		What a wonderful home-test of kidney function, but the idea had never 
		been taken seriously. I received a call from Oakland’s Highland 
		Hospital. They had a kidney shutdown in a patient who had ingested 
		carbon tetrachloride, available in fire extinguishers, in a suicide 
		attempt. Could I help? <br><br>I knew that the kidney insult was an 
		acute tubular necrosis, as with a TUR, and that recovery was likely if 
		given 10 days of careful fluid control. It also occurred to me that this 
		was an opportunity to study asparagus as a practical kidney test. I went 
		to Oakland to my friend Tiger Hunt’s food supply company. He gave me 
		several cases of canned asparagus. I delivered them to the hospital, my 
		resident asked to feed our patient asparagus every day, and to call me 
		when the odor appeared. We would then apply proven tests for comparison.<br>
		<br>This sounded pretty foolproof to me. But three weeks went by and no 
		call. I reached the resident on the phone and asked what had happened. 
		There was dead silence, before he said, &quot;I hate to tell you this, but we 
		asked the patient the question for three weeks, and his answer was 
		always 'No.' Finally, he volunteered that he had lost his sense of smell 
		many years ago.&quot; I wish I had made the resident take a whiff each day as 
		urine flow began, but the time advantage had been lost, and another 
		great experimental observation denied for want of the imaginative right 
		question. I was not effective, it seems. <br><br>Several weeks earlier, 
		internist Gale Whiting had called to tell me about his patient who 
		wondered that his very adequate urine flow looked like water and his 
		asparagus intake brought no smell. Six days earlier his large artery, 
		the aorta, had been studied with an aortogram (dye visible by X-ray), a 
		test notorious for causing renal shutdown. I recognized this as a 
		high-output kidney failure (LNN), to fully recover after ten days. 
		Because urine output was normal, although quality abnormal, I decided it 
		best to &quot;let sleeping dogs lie.&quot; So, I couldn’t follow through, although 
		now I think I should have repeated the asparagus routine. Yes, lawyers 
		were snooping around in those days, making unnecessary and nonproductive 
		trouble. Someone will eventually make a name for himself with what would 
		seem to be a humorous study–––the odor of asparagus as a kidney test. 
		There is still so much like this to do in our search for knowledge that 
		requires just common sense, and a &quot;Do it Now&quot; habit. <br><br><br><br>UC 
		Bear Juice–––before Gatorade<br><br><br><br>In the early 1960s, Jerry 
		Patmont, team physician at UC Berkeley, asked if I could help in 
		combating the cramps experienced by the football team when playing the 
		University of Arkansas in the heat of the late summer. I asked Dr. John 
		Saunders, friend, brilliant original thinker, and world traveler as well 
		as a professor of anatomy at the university, what Red Sea sailors used 
		to combat dehydration. We reached agreement that a solution with 2 grams 
		of salt per liter (estimated basal concentration in sweat) and 5% sugar 
		for taste would prove a very palatable liquid. When consumed at about 1 
		liter every 30 minutes, it should do the job, and I would have salty 
		potato chips everywhere. <br><br>It worked and is used to this day. 
		Arkansas lost to California for the first time. We called it Bear Juice. 
		I suggested to Jerry that he find a UC bottler and market this 
		replacement solution to make money for Cal sports. When Jerry did 
		nothing, I learned another lesson. If you have an original idea, you, 
		and only you, must carry it forward or it is likely not to be realized.<br>
		<br>I am sorry I didn’t go ahead on this on my own, although I had 
		plenty to do. The irony is that about two years later, Gatorade, an 
		almost exact duplicate with a little unneeded potassium, was designed by 
		a urologist in Florida. I have always wondered if he knew his fluid 
		balance. <br><br>Ideas are rarely the domain of a single individual, for 
		knowledge and mechanisms to utilize this knowledge abound, if one just 
		looks. The designer of Gatorade recognized The Problem. It didn’t 
		require an expert to solve it. It took common sense and a few paragraphs 
		in a physiology text about the makeup of sweat.<br><br><br><br>Cine 
		recordings and serendipity; ureteral orifice configuration and 
		competence<br><br><br><br>The camera has played a major part in my life. 
		Its most powerful effect has been on the quality of recall that brings 
		with it exquisite memories of family life. In practice, I also used the 
		camera to record what was in view, not with the intention of proving 
		anything, but with the hope that this recall would reveal truths not 
		otherwise possible to recognize in an instant of vision. This latter 
		hope has been fully justified. The best examples are the recordings of 
		the interior of the child’s bladder, as I did my diagnostic 
		cystoscopies. A few minutes were added to operating times, and I made 
		sure they were well used.<br><br>I took no pictures until fiberoptic 
		lighting appeared in the late 1950s. All of a sudden, this constant 
		light made photographic reproduction a reality via small instruments. By 
		trial and error, I hit the perfect combination for true representation 
		of what my eye saw. Though the fiberoptic light seemed to mimic 
		daylight, I discovered that Type A artificial light film, with this 
		light from the new fiberoptic source, produced normal mucus membrane 
		colors. With my delicate lightweight Beaulieu 16 mm. camera mounted on 
		my small endoscope eye-piece, I recorded everything it revealed, to be 
		studied later over and over again. <br><br>What made this experience in 
		discovery unique? It was the recognition that orifices have four 
		configurations that define their ability to act as one way valves that 
		do not allow bladder urine to be forced back into the kidneys, there to 
		do immense damage. I named these Normal, Stadium, Horseshoe, and Golf 
		Hole. They are congenital structural variations that can direct the 
		urologist as to the possibilities for success with medical or surgical 
		intervention. My presentation won The Grand Prize for Clinical and 
		Scientific Investigation at the American Urological Association meeting 
		in 1968. This terminology is used today by experienced urologists. It is 
		particularly valuable for the child. <br><br>Could these observations 
		have been made without the repeated examination of films, later 
		correlated with results? No, for the few minutes that I, the urologist, 
		had had to look and judge orifices could never result in anything more 
		than just impressions. What a step forward was this! Urologists could 
		now communicate through a conduit of understanding made possible by a 
		terminology familiar to all. The camera, with its ability to return to a 
		scene time and time again, is useless without the cameraman then 
		spending hours looking, hoping to see something revealed–––perhaps for 
		the first time.<br><br><br><br>Cine in the operating room and a 
		revelation <br><br><br><br>I would set the movie camera on a tripod, 
		focused on my operating hands. My nurse turned it on and off as I 
		worked. I would repeatedly review the films at home in the late 
		evenings, striving to see what I had not recognized as I operated. The 
		various grades of testicular damage were recorded on the many feet of 
		film. <br><br>At one point I noticed something for the first time. It 
		had been there all along, of course, and it turned looking, into seeing, 
		and recognizing. The normal epididymis, the tube carrying sperm from the 
		testis, is attached to one side of the testicle, full length, as with a 
		fish’s dorsal fin. However, on my films the torsion-prone testicle is 
		found to have its epididymis, attached always to the top of the testis 
		where it connects with the testicle, becoming unattached and hanging 
		free below. It can then curl up along the blood supply of the spermatic 
		cord, leaving the testicle bare. In normal anatomy, the lower pole of 
		the testis is covered by the epididymis, whereas the torsion-prone 
		testicle with epididymis detached has a bare lower pole. This smoothness 
		is easily palpated through the scrotal wall. Once this displacement of 
		the epididymis is recognized as the anatomical defect, the 
		&quot;bell-clapper&quot; designation is understood, and for the first time. <br>
		<br>So, something was gained, although nothing changed in signs, 
		symptoms, and treatment. The alert physician, by recognizing that the 
		bare lower testicular pole discloses a testicle likely to twist, can 
		anticipate the need for orchiopexy (testicle fixation) in the child 
		before the event occurs. In the child or adult with intermittent 
		unexplained scrotal aches, this physical finding can be diagnostic. <br>
		<br>A year or so after the film study had been presented, a military 
		group in Texas described this epididymis deformity without mentioning 
		the observation in the film, so it may well be that this was a 
		simultaneous confirmation. Yet today this observation remains unknown, 
		as new texts don’t include it and oversights persist.<br><br>In terms of 
		defining The Problem, I get an A, based on the unique ability of cine to 
		facilitate discovery. In terms of effectiveness, it is almost an F. I 
		believe that the film never received the attention it deserved and has 
		probably not been copied on video for the ACS library in the modern 
		digital mode. I hope someone will rediscover it, if history is to be 
		preserved.<br><br><br><br>Another breakthrough in fluid electrolyte 
		balance–recognition of insensible losses from the open abdomen<br><br>
		<br><br>Dr. Henry Moorman came to Oakland as the first in a new breed, 
		vascular surgeons, placing the local general surgeons on the defensive. 
		He felt the pressure, for the kind of cases he would operate on would 
		have wide influence on the surgical specialty. He asked me to help him 
		as an assistant, because he wanted active, uncritical help, and also 
		someone who knew something of fluid balance. I was his assistant with 
		the first six cases, all aortic aneurysms (ballooning of the aorta that 
		could rupture and be fatal). As a habitual routine, from the first I 
		measured carefully the fluid and electrolyte input-output backed up by 
		body weights. Our very first case shut down, the kidneys in acute 
		tubular necrosis fashion, as with a TUR.<br><br>I controlled his weight 
		and prevented an overload. On the sixth day his kidney function 
		returned. There was no hemolysis (abnormal breakdown of red cells), so 
		this had to be the result of something else. My intake, output, and 
		weight measurements provided the answer. He had lost 2 pounds, or 1000 
		cc's, of body salt and water for every one of the six hours we operated. 
		So, this was clearly severe dehydration, probably its effects 
		accentuated by the effects of not fully replaced blood losses.<br><br>At 
		the time this syndrome had been attributed to cross clamping of the 
		aorta, compromising kidney blood flow during the repair. That 
		explanation had never made sense to Henry or me, and the dehydration 
		did. So, from that point on, every hour in the operating room, with an 
		abdomen open and losing by evaporation its 6 grams of salt per liter of 
		fluid, required immediate replacement by a combination of salt and water 
		mimicking these losses. No further shut downs occurred. At the same 
		time, I began to preach the gospel of the invisible, thus insensible 
		fluid and salt losses of the open abdomen in surgery. I suspect that 
		eventually someone else discovered these observations too for the 
		problem appears to be solved.<br><br>This was a serendipitous discovery. 
		It was the resul of being in the right place at the right time and with 
		the right homework already done.<br><br><br><br>The intake-output record 
		becomes a hospital staple<br><br><br><br>Another fall-out from my 
		mission to bring sense into the system was the creation of Intake-Output 
		sheets for the nursing records, first in all of the East Bay hospitals, 
		then extending to San Francisco at UCSF, and finally to the outlying 
		cities. Body weight was becoming a daily requirement, a striking break 
		with the past. What made this record unique was the insensible fluid 
		loss, 800 cc's, included each day as output. I felt the need to defend 
		my conception of mandatory insensible 800 cc losses. It took a few years 
		to find the answer as to who originated the name and concept. <br><br>It 
		was in Venice in those wonderfully productive years of Italian medical 
		Renaissance of the early 1500s, where a nobleman named Sanctorius 
		Sanctorius was fascinated by the relation of body weight and water. He 
		was far ahead of his time–––almost 400 years, installing primitive 
		scales in his bathroom and elsewhere, he tracked his own daily weights 
		against intake and measured visible output. He found he always came up 
		800 cc's short. He recognized this for what it was, &quot;invisible 
		perspiration.&quot; He named it, perspiratio insensibalis. So it is today. 
		Incidentally, Sanctorius also invented the first practical thermometer. 
		He was a Leonardo da Vinci of medicine. I wish I could have known him.<br>
		<br>What I had learned, though, by this time is that anyone famous for 
		just one discovery very likely took it from someone else, too busy to 
		notice, or to really care. Sanctorius, the real creator, had discovered 
		much more than just this, and entirely on his own.<br><br><br><br>
		Pioneering intermittent catheterization in children with 
		meningomyelocoele<br><br><br><br>In the mid-1970s, Jack Lapides, 
		professor at Michigan, told the American Association of GenitoUrinary 
		Surgeons (AGUS), about two nurses who had resorted to 
		self-catheterization when their bladder dysfunctions were so great that 
		they could not void effectively. This was true serendipity, as Jack 
		recognized the importance of this simple observation.<br><br>My thoughts 
		were immediately directed to the many girls in our Birth Defects Clinic 
		at Children's Hospital. I returned to give this a try. Fortunately, I 
		was familiar with the glass curved-tip (coudé) catheters that Dr. Meads 
		had used for years. I made these available to the parents. They found 
		them easy to keep sterile and to re-use. It was simply a matter of 
		teaching the technique. The idea took off.<br><br>That this worked and 
		the girls stayed dry was the major step, but again my habit of observing 
		and recording all I could with my camera meant that again I had hundreds 
		of feet of film again. My habit of reviewing them over and over again 
		produced real dividends. I saw that orifice deformities subjected to the 
		disorganized pull of the bladder muscles, typical of these neurogenic 
		bladders, (no muscle-nerve balance) make for a high degree of seriously 
		damaging reflux of urine into the kidneys as the orifices are pulled 
		open when the bladder contracts. What the cines showed, along with 
		collaborating X-rays, was that when the bladders were frequently emptied 
		by catheterization, the aimless muscle bundle spasms quieted down. The 
		orifices, freed of these damaging &quot;pulls&quot; that dragged them open, became 
		competent. This ended the need for corrective surgery, so fraught with 
		difficulty by the original bladder wall deformities. This revelation was 
		totally unexpected. I am sure it would not have been noticed without the 
		cines.<br><br>The article was published in the mid-1970s. It suffered 
		for years the neglect that occurs by not being referenced in new texts. 
		I have no problem with others receiving credit, but I do have a problem 
		that the bladder changes leading to ureteral competence still are not 
		recognized, or at the least, the mechanism of these positive changes 
		still goes unnoticed while the need to know persists. But then again, we 
		had a lot of happier children and parents from that first day. So, a 
		major problem was solved. Thousands of girls, and adults too, are able 
		to function without the social stigma their incontinence would otherwise 
		create. <br><br>What a privilege to be effective, to sense the need and 
		then be handed the cure just by being at the right place at the right 
		time, and to know it!<br><br><br><br>Urinary diversion of boy with 
		posterior urethral valve and relation to growth<br><br><br><br>Of all 
		the observations I have stumbled on serendipitously, this ultimately may 
		be the most important. Hormones that control body growth are still not 
		fully understood, but the kidney is believed to be involved in this 
		process. The observations that follow point to a “growth factor” having 
		its origin in the cells of the kidney tubules. If this is the case, my 
		experience with urinary diversion, which removes any possible 
		obstruction to urinary flow, should provide insight. The boy with a 
		posterior urethral valve (PUV) and obstruction to urine flow that is not 
		entirely removed is small in stature. Once the obstruction is completely 
		removed, the child rapidly achieves normal growth. It is likely that 
		some type of growth hormone is the agent of this transformation.<br><br>
		The maximum obstructive urinary tract lesion compatible with life is the 
		the posterior urethral valve. From the moment of urine formation, the 
		entire system is under intense hydraulic pressure, for the congenital 
		lesion of valvular urethral stenosis (narrowing) must be transited for 
		the urine to be evacuated. The boy is born with a thick, muscular 
		bladder, tortuous inefficient ureters often without muscle power, and 
		hollowed-out kidneys with markedly diminished functioning parenchyma 
		(kidney cells).<br><br>It is still generally accepted that destroying 
		the valve and opening the lower tract is all that can be effective. At 
		the start I, too, accepted this belief, but soon changed my mind when I 
		realized that the baggy ureters were often functioning as tortuous, 
		non-motile (inactive) conduits and acting as obstructions on their own. 
		So, in the tradition of Frank Hinman, whose obstructive concepts were 
		clear to those of us who trained with him, I took it upon myself to 
		break the generally accepted rules, and interrupt the ureters in such a 
		way that they would drain easily as straight conduits to a central 
		single opening which would then be fitted with a bag, easy to change, 
		and allowing the boy to go through prepubescent life without the wet 
		pants of the other serious PUVs. Why are they uniformly wet? Because the 
		damage to the kidney tubule is such that four times the fluid volume of 
		normal is required to rid the body of each 24-hour’s end products, and 
		the child’s efforts to keep up with the flow and stay dry is never 
		perfect.<br><br>I had six boys with serious kidney damage already in 
		place, with parents hoping that I could, by whatever means, improve the 
		likely outcome. I therefore removed all chances of any continued 
		obstruction to flow by interrupting the ureters as they entered the 
		bladder, then bringing them together in a single stoma (opening to the 
		outside) below the umbilicus, where a device could be fitted to collect 
		the urine efficiently.<br><br>Before these six boys were diverted, I had 
		another six who were less damaged, yet with very much the same ureteral 
		limitations, and who were not diverted. In habitual fashion, all twelve 
		boys were carefully followed, and what transpired blew me away. The 
		undiverted six were all of small stature, in the 25th percentile or 
		less, while the diverted six, although with greater renal damage, grew 
		in the normal range, from fifty to one hundred percentile, averaging 
		close to eighty percent. So there had to be a message. The badly damaged 
		renal tubule, if it remains obstructed, must fail in the production of 
		some growth factor normally produced by the cells of the unobstructed 
		tubule.<br><br>My attempts to interest scientists and clinicians 
		studying body growth and its factors have fallen on deaf ears. This is 
		too bad, for time is awasting. Sooner or later, these findings will be 
		made again, but I am astounded at the unwillingness of my young peers to 
		open their eyes and minds to see the possibilities, let alone the value 
		of full decompression for its other values beyond achieving normal 
		stature. The diverted boys, all destined for eventual kidney failure and 
		dialyses and kidney transplants, were given many extra years of adequate 
		kidney function. Because the diversion surgery was done close to birth, 
		parents were spared many extra years of diapers and wet pants, while the 
		boys accepted their appliances as normal. One boy, at age nine, won the 
		state 50- and 100-yard dash championships for two years, his appliance 
		not a hindrance.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 14<br><br><br><br>AT 65, NOT 
		SLOWING DOWN, I SPEED UP<br><br><br><br>Bondurant (Sears Point) raceway<br>
		<img src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/Laurie139_2.jpg"><br>
		<br><br>Giuseppe Cammaroto, friend and tennis pro at Silverado Country 
		Club, knew of my not allowing myself the use of anything close to a 
		sports car. I feared frequent brushes with the law as I drove home after 
		a tiring day in surgery. I knew full well that my love of the automobile 
		made us &quot;one&quot;<br><br>on the road, and I would not notice that my 
		speedometer registered 80 mph as my car would move so smoothly. He asked 
		if I would like to take a spin in his Alfa Romeo Sports car? I did, 
		driving it down a mountain road, most of the way under acceleration. 
		Giuseppi, well tanned, was pale at the the end. It was obvious my run 
		was not what he had expected, nor had I. <br><br>I said,&quot;Giuseppi did I 
		stay on my side of the road all of the way?&quot; <br><br>His answer, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
		<br>&quot;Did I burn any rubber?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No.&quot;<br><br>But he and I had 
		learned something. If this was a built-in tendency of mine, as a fine 
		car and I became one, I had better put myself in the hands of an expert 
		to be sure I kept behaving safely as I aged. I was 65 years old and in 
		the down stretch of life when I put the Alpha Romeo to the test. The 
		message was clear.<br><br>So what could I do that I always had wanted to 
		do, while still able to do it? Travel, fishing, scuba diving, body 
		surfing, flying––all passed through my mind, but one exploit had won the 
		day. The fine car was my Achilles heel, as the Alfa had proved. It was 
		the Bondurant Driving School at Sears Point that was now required before 
		it was too late. <br><br>I have, from the original days of my father and 
		his Pierce Arrows, occasionally driven like a racing car driver, at home 
		behind the wheel of a responsive car, feeling at one with it, and making 
		demands that respond to my touch. I don’t mean in terms of speed––that 
		always bored me––but how it handled the turns on a well-engineered 
		mountain road without losing speed, while not burning rubber, and always 
		staying on the correct side of the dividing line. So, it wasn’t too 
		different from a difficult and precise piece of surgery. It demanded my 
		intense unbroken concentration, yet without fatigue. In fact, where 
		others drive tensely, I have always found driving relaxing and providing 
		time to think about the issues ahead. <br><br>I checked in with Bob 
		Bondurant and was accepted in spite of my age. I took the four days off 
		from practice, and in La Jolla Carol took the four days off from our 
		mutual lives, not agreeing with my decision. Admittedly, this was the 
		first time in my married life that I relied entirely on my own judgment 
		in a decision that did effect our days together as a family. But it was 
		now or never, and only I was at risk, life insurance being up to date. 
		Carol was correct in her criticism of the fact that I could not insure 
		the racing car, but I accepted this as good reason to be careful and to 
		rely on the expectation that such accidents were exceedingly rare with 
		Bondurant. A wipeout of a new Datsun Z would cost $26,000. My 
		concentration should therefore be enhanced by knowing this. <br><br>When 
		we signed in, the six of us, we were taken by boss Bob Bondurant for a 
		run in a van. He drove it like a race car, hitting the turns at high 
		speed as we held our breaths. I never quite figured out what he meant to 
		do, but I believe that the message was that if a van can do this, you 
		had better expect more from a race car.<br><br>Then began our classes, 
		one each day for at least two hours, where we had hammered into us the 
		rules of the racing road, and what was expected of us in terms of 
		safety. A bunch of &quot;little things,&quot; at least on the surface, in the end 
		became &quot;big things.&quot; For the first two nights, my sleep was spasmodic as 
		I went over the rules, concerned that my years might prove a limitation.<br>
		<br>Now we were to go on the road. There were three of us and one 
		instructor to a car, a small Datsun 4-door, and each of us took a turn 
		at the wheel on the oiled surface designed to teach what a car does when 
		you control its motion with hands and brakes, just as in the movie 
		thrillers.<br><br>We would be told to make the move to spin the car by 
		first touching the brakes sharply, quickly releasing, and at the same 
		time whipping the wheel clockwise quickly as far as we could, and then 
		letting go. The net result was that the car spun 180 degrees as it 
		reached free fall. With hands off it straightened out in the same 
		driving line, though now backwards. How to get back in the original 
		driving direction? Repeat the motions, and you are again heading home. 
		My engineering lessons told me that this was all very logical for the 
		inertial energy was still directing the action, keeping us on line while 
		we just danced in it. We had learned what all trained drivers know, and 
		we did it. <br><br>The next two days were sheer joy as we drove Datsun 
		Z's full out. The great trick was to touch the curb at the apex of the 
		turn, marked by my teacher’s foot, having braked a little to get there, 
		and then gun out full blast as the turn is completed. On day two I got 
		the devil from Steve, my coach, because I had not put up my hand as I 
		made a pit-stop. He told me I wasn’t concentrating. I disagreed, for as 
		a surgeon, concentration was my most important trait. &quot;I just slipped 
		up,&quot; I said, and further stated that if I wasn’t making it and was a 
		danger to others and myself, he should wipe me out. Well, he didn’t, for 
		whatever reason.<br><br>On day three we had a time trial of which I was 
		not aware, yet I managed to come in third out of the six. At least three 
		were on their way to possible racing careers. One had just gotten second 
		in that free-for-all race across the USA, having lost at the last minute 
		when he didn’t have chains. The winner did, as the racers hit the rare 
		fall snowstorm at Donner Pass. The fourth was a broker from Boston who 
		kept his Porsche in the garage all winter. But how different the two of 
		us were. He complained about his shoulders and arms aching during and 
		after driving, something not happening to me, I guess, because this 
		whole experience for me was a relaxation with finger tip control of a 
		fantastic machine.<br><br>So where was the joy? It was in the action of 
		person and car on the high speed turn, going full out and not burning 
		rubber. When I would first get in the car and get all buckled in, I felt 
		tense and concerned, perhaps afraid, as I tried to remember all of the 
		regulations and precautions. Then I would grasp the wheel and hit the 
		accelerator. The tenseness left immediately and it was one continuous 
		&quot;hurrah&quot; from there on. I really didn’t get any particular joy out of 
		speeding full out on the straight-aways. It was the cornering that was 
		the challenge and my joy. I don’t remember any speeds recorded, for our 
		gauges only showed RPM’s. I suppose that was a good idea.<br><br>Day 
		three’s highlight was the learning experience designed to test the 
		limits of what a person and car can do when quick turns or sudden 
		stopping are demanded. This was accomplished by a series of booths with 
		traffic lights that at the last moment demanded quick brake or turn 
		actions. The lessons were really directed at how, with speed, you have 
		so little control, and made obvious the importance of distance between 
		cars for safety. It also left me with a little more of a roving eye 
		while driving, assessing the escape routes on the road sides, should 
		sudden swerves be required. Clearly, it is better to make these detours 
		than trying to stop, which puts you and the drivers, both in front and 
		behind, also at risk. <br><br>This concern was already pretty well built 
		in for me, for I remember so well an incident on the way to Carmel years 
		before. I was driving a Mercedes sedan and noticed in my rear vision 
		mirror an eighteen-wheeler going too fast over the bridge I had just 
		crossed. It seemed likely that the driver did not know the road, for it 
		suddenly became a narrow two-lane through the artichoke fields, and the 
		workers were also known as notoriously bad drivers. In this instance, 
		one had blocked the road. I stopped well away from the car ahead in 
		order to have room to maneuver if required, for I could see smoke 
		emerging from the truck’s tires. He was not going to make the stop! I 
		didn’t wait to see if he could. I gunned my car off the road and into 
		the artichoke field. The truck stopped just a few inches from the bumper 
		of the car I had been behind. Someone was looking after me that day, 
		though the eyes on the rear vision mirror get the credit. I hadn’t yet 
		been to Bondurant. I guess Dad trained his sons well.<br><br>On day four 
		we drove the small Formula cars, where one’s buttocks almost scrape on 
		the track itself. And on that day the big stock cars were warming up for 
		the NASCAR race that weekend and were all around us, but we had the 
		right of way on all occasions. I so well remember my bouncing rearview 
		mirror being filled with the radiator and headlights of the big car as 
		it stayed inches behind until I would raise my arm to let him pass on 
		one of the short straight-aways. He would go by with a hand signal and a 
		broad smile. What fun!<br><br>One incident I will never forget. On day 
		three, we were going all out, and the turn I loved most was a wide 
		180-degree turn that dipped and was so wonderfully banked that I drove 
		on full acceleration throughout it. I broke out at the brow of the hill 
		full blast, to look down at another 180-degree turn, very tight, that 
		would require a fair amount of braking. As I crested, I saw a strange 
		sight–––a car was parked at the apex of the turn facing directly towards 
		me, as though monitoring our driving. My concentration did break as my 
		subconscious said, &quot;What a fool to be there in such danger.&quot; I felt my 
		left front wheel catch slightly on the edge of the macadam. I sensed 
		that I was in trouble, and that the car could be thrown off the road. 
		Whether by luck, feel, or what I had learned on the oil, I braked and 
		swung the wheel clockwise as far as I could to throw me into a spin, 
		then released the wheel. The net result: I spun 180 degrees and I came 
		to a stop parallel to the other car as though we were parked together. I 
		looked at the other occupant, recognized him as Steve, my instructor, 
		smiled, waved and was off again at full speed. Did he wet his pants? I 
		never asked him, but odds are he never again would pull that dumb stunt. 
		My daily grade that had gone from a D to a C suddenly became a B for the 
		last two days. We never spoke of our encounter, I am sure both feeling 
		that lady luck had been our companion.<br><br>For me, the message was 
		clear. At 65, I was still able to react to emergency danger in a 
		positive fashion, and I don’t remember getting the shakes later that I 
		hear so much about. Yes, one learns something about himself in 
		unplanned, unforeseen ways, but it seemed that my joy in being part of a 
		fine car at its top performance was the real thing and it was still in 
		place. How fortunate can one be?<br><br>I drove home in my Cadillac 
		Eldorado, enjoying its luxurious comfort and physical safety, without 
		ever again feeling the desire to push the envelope.<br><br><br><br>
		CHAPTER 15<br><br><br><br>FROM BERKELEY TO NAPA<br><br><br><br>At home 
		in the Napa Valley, but commuting to Berkeley<br><br><br><br>By 1983, we 
		had been living in the Napa Valley for 13 years. We had moved from 
		Berkeley after all of the girls were in college, for the city we loved 
		had deteriorated. My proximity to the Queen of the Valley Hospital in 
		Napa, with a high-caliber staff, allowed me to fill a urological need 
		there in my free hours, operating on many cases that were far from 
		routine. Was I tempted to establish a new practice in this delightful 
		wine country? No, for my pediatric practice in Oakland's Children's 
		Hospital was a constant joy, and our case load made possible more 
		breakthroughs as the specialty continued to develop. Thus I commuted for 
		these thirteen years, forty-five miles each way, with plenty of time to 
		think as I drove. Many times I would arrive home to have Carol tell me I 
		must go back. My CB car radio wasn’t effective, and cell phones were 
		years away.<br><br>Although my fellow physicians in Berkeley had a hard 
		time understanding how I could manage this commute of forty-five miles 
		to and fro, they recognized that my &quot;on call&quot; availability had not 
		changed. These years were as productive as ever.<br><br><br><br>Surgical 
		scale creation–––a last minute excursion<br><br><br><br>My passion about 
		weight and water never ended as weighing patients before and after 
		surgery became a hospital routine, but operative weight and water 
		control was yet ahead. Dr. Edward Teller, creator of the hydrogen bomb, 
		was on my TUR table for a prostatic resection, the risk of irrigant 
		absorption and dilution of body cells, brain included, always present. 
		Why should this risk be tolerated? An operative scale could tell me 
		minute-by-minute whether absorption was occurring. I would do something 
		about it, in &quot;Do It Now&quot; fashion. But that had to wait as I pondered how 
		this might be achieved.<br><br>As I was nearing retirement, a new 
		patient, Terry Taylor, in his late sixties was seen with a suspicious 
		prostate to my finger, biopsies proving the highest grade prostatic 
		carcinoma. I knew it would be fatal within a two-year span. We went for 
		broke, and started X-ray therapy, which proved disastrous, causing a 
		degree of pain and urinary frequency unique in my experience. This 
		remarkable man was made comfortable with a supra-pubic tube (catheter 
		through the lower abdomen, rather than the urethra), which he changed 
		himself, as he journeyed to and from Scandinavia. There, as well as in 
		the Radiation Lab in Berkeley, he was a creative troubleshooting 
		engineer in the radiological fields. Terry knew his prognosis and my 
		helplessness. He asked if there was something he could create in the 
		remaining time, for he could recognize my similar inquisitiveness. I 
		said that a surgical scale could be a great contribution, badly needed 
		as fluid imbalances in surgery was a major contributor to complications 
		and even death. His dear friend David Moore, also a technical person in 
		semi-retirement, was anxious to make a contribution. I was the passive 
		member of the group, all of us with the same intention to contribute, 
		financial returns not considered. We each contributed $15,000 
		eventually. I believe only Terry and I knew the disease with which we 
		were dealing at the time. I knew full well he understood the situation.
		<br><br>I said that a surgical scale could be a great contribution, 
		badly needed as fluid imbalances in surgery was a major contributor to 
		complications and even death. We went to work in his living room, as he 
		designed and built the scale to finally go into action on the TUR table 
		at the VA, where I was a consultant. It was a massive and exact work of 
		art. It was built by experts, from steel fabricator to cabinet maker. 
		What resulted was a scale which we fixed firmly to the San Francisco 
		Veterans Hospital TUR table. The inert, supine patient could be 
		continuously monitored throughout the procedure. <br><br>I was able to 
		do twenty-five cases with the resident, demonstrating its sensitivity as 
		we could recognize “overload” while still correctable. I presented the 
		paper at the AUA, expecting it to be immensely useful for the prostatic 
		resection (TURP), but also for the general surgeon operating for hours 
		on the elderly, whose state of hydration was a critical component, yet 
		only estimated with current and present methods. Overload with resulting 
		cardiac failure was not rare. The operative scale also could prevent the 
		fluid overload during endoscopic gynecological procedures. I gave it a 
		try there, but no takers.<br><br><br><br>I play the patent game.<br><br>
		<br><br>Gaining a patent for our surgical scale was another story. Our 
		attorney was unable to get the necessary patent after three tries. To 
		his chagrin, I asked if I could go to the Patent Office and make the 
		direct presentation. I went to Washington and met a distinguished patent 
		attorney, who took me to the Patent Office for my appointment with the 
		examiner. <br><br>Each examiner is a young scientist, who spends ten 
		consecutive years on the job while pursuing, fully paid, further 
		education. My examiner was a tall, spare, studious man who sat me down 
		and said, &quot;Tell me about it.&quot; I replied that I would have to educate him 
		as to body physiology to make my points. He smiled, and told me to go 
		ahead. Over the next hour I took him through the whole process in my 
		simplistic fashion. When I had finished, he said that I had made my 
		points.<br><br>&quot;But I haven’t mentioned the scale.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You don’t 
		have to. The need for the scale is obvious.&quot;<br><br>The patent was 
		issued.<br><br>I guess you would have to believe that this was really 
		the last point in a process that assured success, but things didn’t turn 
		out that way. Terry Taylor, massive mind, passed away on almost the day 
		I did our first case at the VA. At the least, he knew he had made 
		another significant contribution. I think if we had gotten off the 
		ground, the scale would eventually have been known as Taylor-Made.<br>
		<br>To get &quot;off the ground&quot; was not to be, unbelievable as this might 
		seem. From the moment of its appearance, resistance organized and was 
		effective through silence.0 I was astounded to recognize that the 
		bottleneck lay with the anesthesia department. I was scheduled to 
		present the scale to that group, but they made sure never to have the 
		meeting. I ran a few cases myself, despite this resistance. The scale 
		was a wonder. At a point every 10 minutes or so, when surgery lagged, I 
		would say, “Hands off,&quot; and an accurate measurement was made. It was 
		simply wonderful! Further, I found that body weight, and thus body 
		water, that is kept normal throughout a procedure as IVs are monitored, 
		allowed under-replacement of blood loss to be well tolerated.<br><br>So, 
		I had to face the reality that “anesthesia” had enough on its plate. Not 
		being humanists, they had no intention of upsetting their routines, no 
		matter the price to the patient. Two articles on cerebral accidents 
		appeared that presumed, without the slightest proof, to be from emboli ( 
		loose blood clots) at surgery, one in the New England Journal of 
		Medicine (NEJM) and one in the Journal of the American medical 
		Association (JAMA). Diplomatically, I suggested that if someone would 
		review pre- and postoperative body weights, fluid overload might be 
		revealed as a more likely cause of cerebral edema acting like an 
		embolus. But my notes remained unacknowledged. Our concept of advancing 
		surgical care was thwarted. <br><br>How did we get from the experimental 
		model, fixed to the TUR table, to the commercially-perfected lighter 
		model I used in general surgery? I reached Scaletronics, the number one 
		surgical scale maker that had taken the lead away from Acme, which had 
		made my original InBed scale. David Hale, creative engineer and company 
		founder, provided the final commercial scale. This is a beauty that is 
		light and can be easily moved from table to table. It is accurate to 10 
		grams. It fits on both TUR and general surgery operating tables. Without 
		acceptance by anesthesiology, the scale lies gathering dust at the San 
		Francisco VA hospital. I keep hoping that some unforeseen opportunity 
		will arise that demands this added operative control, but it is not 
		likely in my time. There is some positive fallout, for in the process, 
		manufacturer David Hale took a next step when he constructed the first 
		tiny scales for the newborn. <br><br>The surgical scale could have 
		ranked with my original scale and leg wraps as a major contribution of 
		which I could now be justly proud. As to effectiveness, I get a big 
		zero. Had I known the outcome would I have gone ahead? Absolutely, not 
		anticipating or even believing, what would transpire. What is amazing is 
		the combinations of personalities, experience, training, and dedication 
		that came together for this moment in time. I can only hope that his 
		creativity and generosity to his last breath made Terry’s passing more 
		acceptable to him because he gave to the very end. <br><br><br><br>
		CHAPTER 16 <br><br><br><br>I RETIRE <br><br><br><br>Time to retire: at 
		67 it seemed the wise thing to do<br><br><br><br>The travel between Napa 
		and Berkeley seemed to be lengthening as my professional 
		responsibilities did not lessen. I now had two partners, yet I was still 
		on duty many nights and weekends. Sixty-seven is a good time to call it 
		quits, while physical and mental dexterity have not slipped. Giving up 
		the pediatric work was the price I did not wish to pay. However, it 
		seemed as if the specialty had made such advances in the realm of 
		substituting less-invasive instrumentation that I would require special 
		training better applied to the young urologists. I would be just 
		treading water. Looking back, the decision was correct.<br><br>Does 
		anyone know what retirement really means? I surely didn’t, beyond 
		expecting a little more time to improve my golf swing, read, cut the 
		lawn, plant vegetables, and rove with my camera in the vineyards and 
		wineries of the Napa Valley. And I could more actively support Carol as 
		she sustained the Napa Valley Museum as President, envisioning a new 
		museum and creating it. Using her artistic talents and enthusiasm, she 
		would see this constructed on the expansive beautiful grounds of the 
		Veterans Home in Yountville.<br><br>What then happened? &quot;How to&quot; books 
		galore are written on retirement. They always suggest a list of 
		possibilities. What they don’t emphasize is that an active and 
		fulfilling retirement requires years of getting ready for it. And how is 
		this done? It demands enjoying your work, adding something to it each 
		day, and then not accepting retirement as an escape. Retirement is a 
		continuum, as curiosity, an open mind, and a &quot;Do It Now&quot; habit finds new 
		fields to explore, and the world is just sitting there waiting to be 
		further explored. This is exactly what happened to me. No searching, 
		just recognizing and doing it now, as has been habitual for me right 
		along. Would I now tackle new problems? Yes and no, as my record of the 
		next twenty years of a life in continuum is selective. <br><br>We had 
		lived comfortably in a quiet Napa residential area with room for a 
		vegetable garden and other joys of outside living. However, it was time 
		for a change, and this took place just two years before retirement. 
		Carol’s artistic talents were given expression in a new home with a view 
		on a hill not yet discovered by most. It was modeled after the work of 
		architect Luis Barragón, whose homes in Mexico were striking for their 
		lack of decoration, while their pastel walls, at times stark, radiated a 
		kind of comfortable dignity that was Carol’s style. We built our home 
		and were alone on our hill for a little while, but within the year, 
		dwellings below started to appear and hem us in. Then a strange thing 
		happened.<br><br><br><br>We move into a historic house<br><br><br><br>
		Lorrain and Judge Tom Kongsgaard had entertained us in their home on a 
		bigger hill close by. Lorrain’s mother had been living alone on the 
		hill’s crest until she passed away five years earlier. For some reason, 
		this family mansion had remained off limits. We had wondered about it, 
		but only as a curiosity. Then Lorrain suggested we see it sometime, it 
		being reputed to be just an ugly concrete structure made from the 
		concrete basalt building blocks her father had introduced to America. 
		Its roof shingles were also concrete and fireproof, possibly the first 
		such in the world. <br><br>I came home early one afternoon to find Carol 
		in the kitchen. As she turned, I saw a strange look, her eyes hiding 
		something.<br><br>I said, &quot;Guess you either just made a killing at 
		Lohmann's, or you looked at the house.&quot; (Lohmann's was a luxury clothes 
		outlet in Concord).<br><br>&quot;Well, I didn’t go to Lohmann's, Dick.&quot;<br>
		<br>My response was,&quot;Then let’s go look at the house.&quot;<br><br>We drove 
		to the top of Stonecrest, walked around to the north side, and saw The 
		View. It was so much like Dad’s view of Mt. Diablo, when he built his 
		house near Lafayette in the Hidden Valley he would later subdivide. Mt. 
		St. Helena and the entire Napa Valley spread out before us as we stood 
		next to the four-square concrete one-story house on a dry, grassy slope 
		bounded by oaks to the south. For just a moment we stood in awe, then 
		turned and got back in the car, as I said,&quot;Next step is to have the 
		girls see this.&quot; They did, and responded with a single judgment, &quot;Dad, 
		you’re stuck.&quot; What they meant, I think, is that although we had been in 
		our new home for only two years, now we would be on the move again.<br>
		<br><br><br>Photography starts the ball rolling<br><br><br><br>Once 
		settled in after having turned the concrete bunker into a home, I found 
		myself back in a photo mode, particularly as a storage closet became a 
		darkroom. This was a day when the films were black and white and 
		Kodachrome, a far cry from today’s digital world. I was ready to go back 
		into action, for a darkroom had not been available for 15 years. With my 
		Leica, Pentax, and Nikkoromat cameras in hand, I roved the valley, 
		believing that both black-and-white and color would be needed to capture 
		what I might see.<br><br>With the sudden loss of the exhilaration of my 
		pediatrics work, I found myself with camera in hand, wandering though 
		vineyards and wineries, just looking to see what was there. My Pentax 
		with black-and-white 400 Tri-X film would get a workout. <br><br>It had 
		been a long time since I had worked in my spacious, wonderful dark room 
		in Berkeley, so what to do about this? Our new house had a 10x6 foot 
		closet just outside the kitchen with bare floor, walls, and ceiling and 
		no running water. Well, this had to do, and I adjusted by trucking my 
		water in and out in pails. I carefully placed used solutions in multiple 
		bottles, because I couldn’t take the chance of damaging our vineyard 
		with septic tank effluent containing photographic chemicals.<br><br><br>
		<br>Jimo Perini, photo mentor<br><br><br><br>Another mentor appeared at 
		the right time. Kathy was to be married at home on our spacious lawn 
		backed by the Chardonnay vineyard. She had just met Jimo Perini, 
		possibly the most accomplished 35 mm. black-and-white photographer in 
		the world. In a weak moment, he had agreed to photograph her wedding, 
		just minutes before flying into the stratosphere on his next assignment 
		abroad. We became instant friends, and he became my mentor in tricks of 
		the trade that would spur me on as I recorded what my roving eye would 
		discover in our beautiful valley. <br><br>Vineyard forays were 
		incessant. I would often stop the car, and climb over a fence to talk to 
		the boss or the owner of a vineyard. I was sold on my new world, 
		typified by the elderly grower who, when asked what he would do if his 
		tractor broke down in the midst of a busy season, answered, &quot;I would go 
		next door to my neighbor.&quot; But then he added, &quot;It is not quite that 
		simple, because I have three neighbors and I run the risk of hurting the 
		feelings of the other two.&quot; What a delightful world, and it hasn’t ever 
		changed. <br><br><br><br>We become growers and wine makers<br>
		<img src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/Laurie741.jpg"><br>
		An inside look at the wine world was at our front door. John Kongsgaard, 
		son of our neighbor, wine maker and viticulturist combined, had planted 
		grapes on our half acre to the east. The judge had an acre of 
		Chardonnay, his and ours, and a few rows of choice Zinfandel that would 
		be processed by the Judge and his friends. 200 cases was the goal easily 
		achieved each year. <br><br>We had been in our hilltop home for just a 
		year when Tom and Lorrain made a trip abroad. As he left, Tom said, 
		&quot;You’re in charge.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In charge of what?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The pick, of 
		course.&quot;<br><br>I was on the hook, a neophyte, but such challenges were 
		not new. I enlisted Tom’s daughter, Mary, and with the help of neighbors 
		and John’s field worker team to do the picking, we had the wine 
		&quot;cooking&quot; in the barrels on the Judge’s return. His surprise and relief 
		was obvious. To me, the implications were otherwise. I had been 
		projected into a new world. I was hooked, and would run with it. <br>
		<br>The next several years were devoted to just another search to 
		understand the process, this time not looking for a solution. Process 
		was quite enough. I had a living library from which to learn, as 
		founders in their seventies and eighties never had lost their joy in the 
		vineyards and their desire to pass on what they had learned to anyone 
		interested enough to ask the questions. This had always been natural for 
		me. It led to long sessions with the tape recording in the background, 
		their voices now preserved for posterity in our Valley Wine Library in 
		St. Helena as I absorbed their wisdom to the point that my &quot;dumb 
		questions&quot; had no answers as I probed the borders of their art. My 
		camera also was working, and black-and-white portraits are on the 
		library wall. They will stay black, not become brown with time, for as 
		was always my habit in practice when exploring a new way to do 
		something, immediate success had to result in long term success, for a 
		lifetime is so short. A new batch of “hypo” fixing solution was made for 
		each portrait. Who are these immortals? Nathan Fay, Charles Wagner, Roy 
		Raymond, Joseph Heitz, Maynard Amarine, Andre Tchelistcheff, Louis 
		Martini, Brother Timothy, and Robert Mondavi, all now gone, while Joseph 
		Phelps, Warren Winiarsky, Robert Travers, Peter Mondavi, Joseph Grgich, 
		and Angelo Regusci are still on the job. &quot;Doing it Now&quot; with my camera 
		has paid off in spades. <br><br>As the process became clearer, my camera 
		whirred, often now on movie film. My questions mounted as they raised 
		more questions, always answered, until I, embarrassed at my invasion, 
		waved goodbye. This was the &quot;chosen land&quot; that had chosen Carol and me 
		to enter.<br><br><br><br>I am now a publisher<br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/Laurie761.jpg" style="float: left"><br>
		The next logical step was for me to become a book creator, and then a 
		publisher. How could that be? It is always just such a dream for so 
		many. Carol was responsible. She had repeatedly said, &quot;Dick you have 
		learned so much from these men and taken so many pictures of what they 
		do, shouldn’t you write a book providing the fundamentals buried in the 
		texts?&quot; It had never occurred to me, but now it seemed an obligation, 
		for so many desired to know, as Bob Mondavi was exposing the wonders of 
		wine to the world.<br><br>How to make it go? The businessman that Dad 
		trained now expressed himself. The book would have to be black and white 
		at first to make it possible financially. I stumbled on Moshe Shor, a 
		man of immense integrity, who could do the printing in Korea. With help 
		from a graphic artist, Judy, the job was done. I made a &quot;dummy&quot; and 
		named it Vine to Wine. I took the dummy to Silverado Country Club, to 
		the principal bank in town, and to Saylor and Hill, my brother-in-law’s 
		insurance firm in Oakland. All three organizations had more than just a 
		taste for wine. With the bargain price a little above cost, they all 
		agreed to invest in my project. The income from 3,500 books paid 
		publishing expenses, leaving $1,500 for profit. It would be a dollar 
		spent for a dollar earned, and Dad would be happy.<br><br>Vine to Wine I 
		was so successful that another 10,000 copies found their way abroad and 
		into our valley, as I, now the salesman, pushed my books in every kind 
		of outlet from winery tasting rooms to drug stores. It was just plain 
		fun, for as Dad had taught me, &quot;Dick, if you believe in what you are 
		selling, even an Eskimo will buy your refrigerator.&quot;<br><br>I was also 
		sensitive to the growing appeal of color in publications. So, for four 
		years I compiled a journal or daybook, telling the story of vineyard and 
		winery in color in a day-to-day fashion. All of these were intended to 
		teach those who wished to know. Three thousand journals were lapped up 
		each year. At the same time, I had the joy of learning more each day, my 
		camera solidifying every memory. I was welcomed in all of the wineries, 
		tasting rooms, and work areas, and was even able to photograph the night 
		picking just beginning in the Carneros region. My literary adventures 
		were nothing more than an expression of the Process Mind trying to 
		understand, and in this way remember.<br><br><br><br>Vine to Wine II is 
		created and I become a better salesman.<br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/vine.jpg" style="float: left"><br>
		With an immense store of wine-related Kodachromes, it was logical to 
		create Vine to Wine in colo, and hard cover. This, too, was well 
		received; some 15,000 copies sold across America. It now resides on 
		Amazon and is likely to become a classic, as no one has appeared to 
		repeat my desire to teach, and not just to impress. At the least, it 
		will remain a primer that tells how things were back when.<br><br>A 
		National Geographic photographer, already famous for his recent work 
		here in our valley, turned to me at lunch one day and said, &quot;Dick, how 
		do you take your pictures?&quot;<br><br>My answer was &quot;Are you kidding me? I 
		won’t carry coal to Newcastle.&quot; <br><br>He answered, &quot;No, I mean it.&quot;<br>
		<br>My response was, &quot;OK. I am driving, often on an errand, and my eye 
		sees something special. I stop the car, and get out, trying not to be 
		hit by a passing car, and then over the fence I go. I walk up to a 
		worker, show him my camera, and ask, 'May I please take a picture of 
		what you are doing?' He rarely understands my words, but we communicate 
		somehow. With a broad smile he says 'Si.' That’s it.&quot; <br><br>“Thanks 
		Dick, I guess I have a ways to go. Perhaps my whitening hair will help, 
		for when I do just what you did, I am perceived as an agent of the 
		Immigration Service and backs are turned.” Once again, as I have always 
		believed as I take photos, &quot;It’s all in the eyes&quot; of the photographer 
		and the photographed alike.<br><br><br><br>Wildflowers seen by my macro 
		lens<br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/1690547-L.jpg" style="float: left"><br>
		The years went by but nothing changed for me, then in my eighties. I was 
		blessed with fine health. My golf swing became shorter and shorter, the 
		compensation being I hit the ball straighter and straighter, but the fun 
		with the &quot;big hit,&quot; no matter its course, was gone. So what? If the old 
		head would stay active, how could I ask for anything more?<br><br>Well, 
		there was more. This continues to be the saga of a guy who, as he walks, 
		looks down, kicks pebbles aside, and uncovers precious Indian 
		arrowheads, unnoticed for years, that open up a new vista to be studied. 
		This was the case with wildflowers.<br><br>I had driven hundreds of 
		miles in my forays into vineyards, wineries, and bookstores, eyes always 
		on the road. But these wide-open-orbs discovered beauty everywhere, as 
		peripheral vision kept noticing splotches of color on the roadsides. 
		These were wildflowers. They took me back to Boy Scout days, when I had 
		searched for magnificent Trillium, determined it would be the prize 
		among my required fifty flowers for a wildflower merit badge. <br><br>
		Over many years this desire to recognize the varieties surfaced many 
		times, but I was always frustrated by the published texts that covered 
		too many flowers in too many places, and not always in full color. I had 
		all the books from basic Peterson on up, but even he, either running out 
		of money or wishing for more profit, depicted most of the flowers as 
		plain line drawings and left me uninformed.<br><br>The Problem: too many 
		pictures with too little identifying information to find specimens. The 
		Solution: take photos as I drove, trying to stay safe from passing cars, 
		then at home study and identify them. I would stick to what was familiar 
		here in the Napa Valley. The photos did it, for I was doubly blessed 
		with my Nikkoromat, purchased so long ago. It has a very special macro 
		lens, equally good for landscapes. I could photograph from infinity to 
		as close as two inches. I chose to shoot at two feet and thus mimic what 
		the eye would see comfortably, not tempted to take extreme close-ups 
		that are dramatic only as works of art.<br><br>Once again, something 
		unexpected happened: The photos and their descriptions became another 
		book, as I tried to apply my yearning to know and make it possible for 
		others to share my joy in knowing.<br><br><br><br>100 Napa Valley 
		Roadside Wildflowers <br><br><br><br>The books would appear in 
		bookstores and hotels as I varied my rounds to contact likely outlets, 
		for I no longer had the luxury of the built-in customers to whom wine 
		had an appeal. To make sure of my data, I enlisted Jake Ruygt, prominent 
		horticulturist, to verify the flowers and amplify the descriptions. On 
		my Apple computer I assembled all and made ready for publication. This 
		was delayed for five months as I waited for Jake’s contributions. I 
		finally laid down the law, because precious time was being lost as a 
		season was racing by. Jake’s rejoinder was, &quot;But Dick, you have so much 
		energy!&quot; I responded, &quot;Jake, don’t you know the difference between 
		energy and enthusiasm?&quot; His needed insights were on my desk in a week. 
		The job was done.<br><br>Two printings of 3,000 each met local demands, 
		as this handy little handbook, sturdy and small enough for a back pocket 
		or purse, saturated the market. It remains today the local bible for 
		adults and children alike. My quick-memory limitations force me from 
		time to time to refer back to my own book, always available in the car 
		as we drive the winding roads ringing our valley and look for the 
		appearance of each flower at its appointed time. The 100 are always 
		there, although locations shift. For instance, wild marigolds are 
		invading and pushing aside long-dominant mustard, orange for yellow, 
		making each day a time to see something new.<br><br>Today, my digital 
		Nikon clicks away so easily and cheaply that it makes a photographer out 
		of anyone. I refuse to fall into that trap. Every photo must tell a 
		story. On my computer I will only sharpen an image, or perhaps make the 
		shading more real, as under-and over-exposures inevitably crop up. Now, 
		on my Apple, I can make a DVD, either with motion or still photos. I 
		favor the latter, for I am allowed time to contemplate.<br><br><br><br>
		The computer discovers me, and I take the plunge into the new world<br>
		<br><br><br>This brings me to the part the computer has and is playing 
		in my life, as the physical limitations of age impinge on my ability to 
		climb fences and stoop in wineries to catch the bubbles of fermentation. 
		So I make do, and recall, and learn.<br><br>On retirement, I made it a 
		point to spend time with Frank Hinman Jr. in his permanent office, the 
		privilege of UC’s retired professors. Frank would be at his computer. At 
		first, I couldn't understand his enthusiasm for this new gimmick, but he 
		won, and I purchased the Leading Edge, a clone of the pioneering IBM. I 
		was off, and walking, yet tiptoeing. Like most older people, I feared I 
		would fail to make it work. I didn’t know then of the relationship of 
		simple algebra that I loved to the mechanics of putting data together 
		that the computer made possible. Fear abated almost immediately as I 
		probed the computer mind. We were simpatico. It knew what it was doing; 
		I would find out what it was doing. It just required patience, and trial 
		and error. The something I might be looking for was always there, 
		somewhere.<br><br>Frank was an Apple computer user from the start. I 
		joined him with my Apple Performa, as I recognized its ability with 
		graphics. I could illustrate and back up a photo message with words. 
		Both color books were created on my Apple, then transferred to a disc 
		and sent to Korea, where the finest of printers electronically did the 
		rest. Could I compose this story without it’s help? Not a chance, but 
		there is much more.<br><br><br><br>The web takes pediatric urology 
		around the world.<br><br><br><br>Six years ago I found myself aware of 
		the communication and educational potential the Internet provides. A 
		“chat” group devoted to this specialty appeared in Chicago, provided 
		direct everyday communication, primarily in America, but soon with the 
		rest of the world. It was a gift to me and my Process Mind, for I could 
		be daily informed of changes, perhaps true advances, and problems in my 
		specially, testing my knowledge based on experience. I have tread 
		carefully, for I have not wished to stultify new ideas that might 
		conflict with proven practices. I have not ventured an opinion without 
		first hearing-out the correspondents before expressing my thoughts. I 
		have chosen not to be judgmental, but to contribute as the voice of 
		experience, that experience testing the teaching of my own mentors. Do, 
		I thus become a mentor? Perhaps, but just for the few like me who, as a 
		habit, never cease searching for mentors.<br><br>On one occasion, a 
		pediatric surgeon asked for advice as to whether his surgical correction 
		of of a congenital obstruction at the point the kidney empties into the 
		ureter ( uretero-pelvic obstruction ) required re-operation as advised 
		by his urological peers. After no response from the American chat group, 
		I asked for the facts, and recognized that the surgery had been 
		successful. His response was a request that I mentor him, for although 
		his city had four million people, there was no urologist willing to care 
		for children with deformities, and he felt a moral obligation to fill 
		this need. I was thrilled to accept the challenge.<br><br>I quickly 
		found myself corresponding with the world which has an active population 
		of experienced pediatric surgeons, but has not the luxury of pediatric 
		urologists. The questions these surgeons are asking are in the 
		urological field, because they find themselves faced with urological 
		congenital deformities in lands where ignorance and poverty is the rule, 
		and medical care is wanting for the young. This is the case in Pakistan 
		and India, two lands that are leaders in adapting the advances made 
		possible in our western world.<br><br>And what have I had to offer? The 
		Process Mind relentlessly examines past experience, the intent to see if 
		my Dad’s law of never making the same mistake twice, is valid. Thus, my 
		teaching has been directed at illustrating Process thinking as the tools 
		the physician must use, and do so naturally. When asked for a 
		presumptive diagnosis, I am unable to comply, for diagnosis and the 
		therapy follow the facts. <br><br>It quickly became apparent that I must 
		work with the tools at hand. The basic tools, available almost 
		everywhere, are the history, urine examination, X-ray abdominal film, 
		and kidney function tests, BUN and Creatinine. Of the greatest value is 
		the IVP. It is still worth its weight in gold because of its 
		availability and at reasonable cost. The pediatric surgeon must add 
		endosopy and cystography to his capabilities, and I have found this 
		teachable, though from far away. Particularly rewarding has been the 
		opportunity to extend the pediatric surgeons talents to hypospadias 
		repairs of all degrees .Ultra-sound, though not as advanced as our own, 
		is a helpmate. The measurement of urine specific gravity, perhaps the 
		oldest of kidney function tests, on occasions has provided needed 
		answers. X-rays will appear on my screen within minutes, and the 
		discussion can go on as I ask the questions as to facts that lead to the 
		diagnosis and treatment. Process Minds of mentor and student come 
		quickly into step, so that as questions appear, and are answered, so do 
		diagnoses and actions. On several occasions I have checked my computer 
		mailbox every few hours, day and night, as facts have been assembled and 
		complex fluid electrolyte balance problems have been solved. This has 
		often demanded inventiveness by my correspondent. As his experience has 
		grown, for the most part I am no longer necessary. What a treat to be 
		unnecessary in this way. And this could not be accomplished without our 
		world wide Web and dedicated physicians in my urological subspecialty of 
		pediatrics.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER 17<br><br><br><br>I TRY TO DISCOVER 
		HOW IT ALL HAPPENED<br><br><br><br>The Process Mind in retrospect<br>
		<br><br><br>As we drove from Sonoma to Napa one day, daughter Laura 
		said, &quot;Dad, I think you should write today what your thoughts are as to 
		how our minds work.&quot; So, here it is, as I relate my experiences with the 
		hope that a few young people may gain insight as to how they think, as 
		they seem to struggle with their identities. It will require some 
		repetition, but here goes.<br><br>My first manifestation of the Process 
		Mind came when I tinkered, taking things apart to see what made them 
		tick (and not always able to get them back together without having some 
		nuts and bolts left over). My asking, and then searching for &quot;Why&quot; was 
		on its way.<br><br>My next encounter would seem to have been when I was 
		encouraged to get &quot;all A’s,&quot; and somehow I didn’t think this important. 
		I had noticed that my friends with &quot;all A’s&quot; always received &quot;all A's.&quot; 
		So I guessed the teachers were biased and, if so, I would not receive 
		the benefit of the doubt, for I was slower to learn as my memory, so 
		dependent on understanding, took second place to the Quick Memories of 
		my best friends.<br><br>There was something else in play, however. I 
		loved the logic of Algebra that always seemed to start with something as 
		simple as 2 x 2 = 4. I feared the memorization demanded in trigonometry, 
		where formulas were the rule and therefore must be accepted at face 
		value, and memorized to be available for testing. This showed up 
		strikingly when I came close to failing Descriptive Geometry in my first 
		Stanford semester. It was really an advanced trigonometry. I dropped out 
		of Engineering. I was convinced that I was just too dumb to make it.<br>
		<br>Dr. Bacon, Professor of Mathematics, thought otherwise. His 
		intervention put me back on course. It was then, for some assurance, 
		that I gained Mom’s admission that my Terman IQ score was 136, and there 
		was hope. I was thankful not to be close to the gifted category, where 
		varied talents so often lead to a confusion in goals, not my style where 
		just making the most of each day was quite enough. With a sigh of 
		relief, I accepted that I would have to just study longer and harder. 
		With persistence I could get there, whatever or wherever “there” might 
		be.<br><br>The next example of the Process Mind in action came when Dr. 
		Hedburg, professor of Engineering Hydraulics, gave me the highest grade 
		in the class, as I developed the formulas others took for granted and 
		applied.<br><br>Up to this point, the direction of my life was not 
		different from that of carpenters, electricians, mechanics, and plumbers 
		who, with common sense and Process-driven minds daily figure out a 
		better way to do things. When I ask them if they can memorize easily, or 
		are they good spellers, they just laugh, often volunteering that, &quot;I 
		wouldn’t be here if I could memorize and spell and get the grades to be 
		a real professional.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You mean ''straight A’s?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of 
		course.&quot;<br><br>I have often asked myself, &quot;Could I have gotten into 
		medical school without the help of those in power who knew me well?&quot; 
		It’s unlikely, and today, with thousands of applicants, the personal 
		interview as a decision-maker is rarely possible. Yet<br><br>medical 
		advances suffer as the person who asked the dumb questions is likely to 
		be excluded. <br><br>The improvements in medical care that I developed 
		would seem to serve as examples of the Process Mind in action. Here are 
		two of them.<br><br>1. In 1948 the recognition was just waiting to be 
		made that slow venous flow could play a major part in the embolus 
		formation leading to its dislodgment and death. It had been waiting and 
		overlooked for years. Why? A Process Mind had not been challenged, I 
		suspect. The Quick Memory minds of immensely competent physician 
		researchers believed that improved anticoagulation was the only way to 
		go. <br><br>But time and place now get into the act. Not only was the 
		Process Mind to be challenged, but the problem, always there, had to be 
		recognized. Further, that Process Mind had to be prepared, as was I, by 
		Bernoulli’s fluid-flow theorem that played a major part in my &quot;A&quot; at 
		Stanford. Was this a special time? I think not, for the anticoagulant 
		Heparin had been in use for years. Thus it was the place that counted. I 
		was there, saw the need, and acted. I &quot;did it now.&quot; All that remained to 
		do was to be effective, the keystone of any advance.<br><br>2. The 
		intrusion into fluid electrolyte balance also required the Process Mind, 
		with time and place making the final difference. The Feldman fluid 
		overload was accepted by medical experts as &quot;The Book&quot; was followed. A 
		Process Mind had to be walking through the ward that very day and be 
		stopped in his track by the sight. Ingrained curiosity took over: the 
		Process Mind saw Mr.Feldman as a problem to be solved. It appeared that 
		liver failure met all of the criteria for that diagnosis. But the 
		Process Mind demanded to go one step further. Symptoms are the 
		end-points of a problem. Thus, I had to search out and define the 
		problem itself before instituting treatment.<br><br>The &quot;eight steps&quot; of 
		Dr. Frank Hinman is a natural outcome of the Process Mind that demands 
		understanding before a diagnosis is made. When the eight steps are 
		taken, then a consistent diagnosis will be the result, time and time 
		again.<br><br>I had difficulty in mastering a foreign language, 
		something my Quick Memory friends found not a problem. While cycling 
		through Germany, conversation in the shops enabled Ted and me to build a 
		working colloquial vocabulary of about 800 words, so happy were the 
		people to help. But then, on returning to college, my two years of 
		Scientific German led nowhere, for when I attempted to translate German, 
		it was a total loss, it seemed because of its grammar that places the 
		verb always at the end of each sentence, no matter how wordy.<br><br>On 
		the other hand, I loved my two grammar school years of Latin that still 
		provides insight into our own language. Was this the Process Mind 
		expressing itself as language foundation roots were exposed? I think so.<br>
		<br>With music, leaving pure talent aside (an obvious personal loss), 
		many hours at the keyboard were necessary for me just to play from 
		memory a tune or two. My lack of a Quick Memory seems the likely 
		culprit, and again hard work and persistence were the only ways of 
		making up the difference. An absence of talent made this untenable.<br>
		<br>Perhaps this discussion is too detailed. However, it is my attempt 
		to make the encouragement of the Process Mind not only the 
		responsibility of one's self, but also that of parents and teachers, and 
		ultimately medical schools. The latter still lag behind many law schools 
		and most business schools, who actively search for curious, prepared 
		Process Minds as leaders for the future. The medical school counters 
		with the new major of Biomechanics. This will prove no substitute for 
		the same creative Process Minds with disciplines in Engineering and 
		Physics, then fine tuned by the third dimension of patient care which 
		only medical school and residencies can provide. It is the “hands on” of 
		the physician, combined with the process itself, that makes for 
		discovery. An allowance of ten percent in each class for engineers 
		wishing to be doctors would, by having the &quot;dumb&quot;questions asked, 
		encourage the Quick Memories to light up their Process Mind qualities, 
		and all would prosper.<br><br>These are all afterthoughts of one given 
		the privilege of extra years and bequeathed the health to enjoy them.
		<br><br><br><br><br><br>Final foray ? Perhaps not <br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/Laurie604.jpg" style="float: left">The 
		Process Mind is never quiet. I have a problem now well defined and it 
		must be solved if I can safely continue driving in ever busier traffic. 
		The apparent problem is that I am 93. The real problem is that my 
		elderly neck is stiffening, and I find looking back before a lane-change 
		takes too long as I take my eyes from the road ahead which increases the 
		danger of a rear-end collision. The stress of driving is increased, for 
		even in younger years the need to look back before a lane change has 
		always been accompanied by apprehension.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/niece.jpg" style="float: left">My 
		acceptance that nothing was being done to correct this need didn’t hit 
		home until six years ago. I recalled that my much loved twenty-six year 
		old niece, Lee Lyon, had been trampled to death by a charging elephant 
		being freed from captivity to the wilds. Lee was an accomplished 
		wildlife photographer. Something went wrong. Only if her camera was 
		mistakenly on &quot;wide angle,&quot; as the warning on my right convex car mirror 
		warns that &quot;Objects in the mirror are closer than they appear.&quot; could 
		this tragedy have taken place. The Process Mind went into action, the 
		solution sought in characteristic &quot;Do It Now&quot; fashion. <br><br>As with 
		my approach to medical diagnosis, facts must first be assembled. These 
		were:<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/book/LEFT%20IN%20VIEW.JPEG" style="float: left">1. 
		The convex mirror on the right does away with the blind spot, but it 
		does not accurately identify the position or speed of a car that is 
		approaching or is in it.<br><br>2. The State Highway Patrol states that 
		2 to 3 car lengths of separation makes for a safe lane change. I chose 
		to accept three car lengths, and thus fifty feet, as the desirable 
		distance. <br><br><br><br>Solution: In our spacious driveway, Carol’s 
		Jeep was placed 50 feet behind my vehicle. Its image on my convex mirror 
		was 2&quot; by 2&quot;. A 2&quot; by 3&quot; Target/Frame, cut from a picnic plate and 
		attached to the mirror, enclosed this image as the car moved from a 
		greater distance to the 50-foot mark. I tested it on the road. The The 
		Target/Frame worked. As long as the following car image remained within 
		the frame and not moving through it, a safe lane change was assured. I 
		had only to quickly glance, without a head turn, keeping my eyes on the 
		road ahead. The surprise was the accuracy of recognizing the speed of an 
		overtaking car as it moved against the frame, now as a reference point.
		<br><br>The left driver’s side mirror presented a different problem. It 
		is flat and its narrower field of vision, no matter how accurately it is 
		placed, could not fully eliminate a blind spot. The suitable 
		Target/Frame, larger than on the right convex mirror, (closer 
		eye-to-mirror distance) also revealed a closing speed, yet my 
		apprehension as I changed lanes still remained. I could not trust that 
		the blind spot had been fully eliminated <br><br>It was logical, then, 
		to duplicate the right mirror of the same convexity, applying it to the 
		flat left mirror, leaving enough mirror &quot;flatness&quot; in place to comply 
		with the law. The myriad of such small mirrors now available come 
		nowhere close to my demands, for their their hyper-convexities reveal 
		tiny images that defy judgment as to position and speed. They serve only 
		as warnings that something is there.<br><br>My patent request was 
		prepared and denied. Why? Because an almost identical patent, drawings 
		and all, had been issued in 1999, yet was not in effect because of 
		nonpayment of maintenance fees. Thus, I can freely make this long-term 
		solution to a driving hazard that accounts for 500,000 accidents each 
		year! The automobile industry has kept its doors locked against any 
		intrusion into its electronic trials with radar. However, the recent 
		Toyota experience is perhaps a warning that complex electromagnetic 
		systems may carry risks.<br><br>To try and be effective, I am placing 
		this solution in the public’s hands on Google and You Tube . The only 
		hindrance is habit and I find it formidable. However, as years become 
		minutes in my time, my habit of identifying problems, then solving them, 
		and finally, being effective serves me well. I now drive without stress, 
		with just glances instead of head turns, my eyes never leaving the road 
		ahead.<br><br>Dr. William Parry, Emeritus Professor of Urology at the 
		University of Oklahoma has his rigid neck in a brace as he drives 
		thousands of miles a year to meet his responsibilities. Only with his 
		bilateral convex mirrors and Target/Frames is this possible.<br><br>
