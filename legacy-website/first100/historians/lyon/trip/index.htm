		<img alt="Dick" class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/lyon/trip/DSCN0193.JPG" style="float: left">Dick 
		joins me in wishing to thank you for your kind thought of us as we 
		started on this great adventure. Your candy – Pardon me. I am still 
		groggy from those thank you letters.<br><br>It is the last day on board; 
		and this morning, land happily met our gaze. We can also see junks and 
		sampans in the distance. Snow rests on the higher land, for it is a 
		clear day, and we can see for quite a distance. We reach Yokohama 
		tomorrow morning early. Now we are steaming down the eastern coast of 
		Japan. Shun will be there to meet us; so everything will be fine. There 
		is so much to tell that I hardly know where and how to start. Dick will 
		probably give you a better idea of it all.<br><br>When we arrived on board we were given 
		first-class accommodations as we have already told you; and since, we 
		have had the run of nearly all the first-class facilities. During the 
		first part of the trip we practically lived in the first-class lounge. 
		It is a most gaudy, poorly decorated room, the worst I have ever seen, 
		but it served as a place of warmth. I did a bit of piano, once in a 
		while, as did Dick. One day we were ut out of there; so we moved into 
		the smoking lounge, in which I am now writing. It has all worked out 
		very well.<br><br>Every morning we open your present, Mother, and we 
		surely do appreciate them. As for our candy, we left some with the 
		McLeans and have eaten but one box of Edy’s. The remaining three boxes 
		have not been touched, but we plan to use them. By the way, in the 
		“Asia” magazine you wrapped up for us in an article about “jade” by 
		Julean Arnold. It is excellent, and we were surprised and happy to find 
		it. I don’t know whether you knew it was there or not.<br><br>Dick and I 
		have been gradually realizing what we are going to miss about the most, 
		and that is our food. The food aboard ship is good, but different. The 
		Oriental sauces and seasonings are a radical change from what we are 
		used to, and the lack of green vegetables is not so good; but I am sure 
		we’ll pull together.<br><br>Probably the most interesting phase of ship 
		life is people. Dick and I are two of eight white people on board, the 
		remaining being Japanese, even the officers and crew. The Japanese are 
		very sociable, and we enjoy talking and doing things with them. The 
		Captain is a keen guy. He has five sons in Tokyo, two studying to be 
		doctors in the Imperial University. He has shown us lots of cards and 
		match tricks. He has played bridge with us, and we have a fine time 
		playing deck golf with him. Each officer is a character in himself, but 
		time and paper do not permit me to go into detail. The one first-class 
		passenger is a dealer in Oriental antiques for large stores in the East, 
		some transactions running into thousands of dollars. <br><br>It must be an 
		extremely profitable business because of the high percent of profit. The 
		only second-class Japanese passenger is a Mr. Higo, who is on his way 
		from Quebec on a government mission for the Province. He has helped me 
		considerably in learning a few words in Japanese. Two of the select 
		eight on board are missionaries on their way to a post outside of 
		Canton, China. They seem happy in their anticipation of their work 
		ahead, but keep very much to themselves. Another is a Philadelphia girl 
		who is on her way to Lingnan University as an exchange student. She has 
		plenty of nerve and is a good sport. We like her considerably. The 
		fourth white person is a nurse who seems to have had wonderful training. 
		She says she got tired of the Vancouver life; so she took a job as a 
		nurse in a missionary hospital in Sendai, a town in North Japan. She 
		spends the first two years learning the language and is there about five 
		years. <br><br>She will surely be successful. Another passenger is a Tokyo 
		business woman. We all like her very much. She has told us much of Tokyo 
		and of the people. We all have a lot of fun together. I have saved the 
		only other white passenger until the last because I like her most and 
		think she is most interesting. In the first place, she is English, which 
		is very prominently displayed in her name, Mrs. Barrington Foote. From 
		the first, she has been my dietician and has done fine. She is a 
		soldier’s widow and has traveled most of her life, although this is her 
		first trip to the Orient, and the last, sh says. Mrs. Foote is bound for 
		Capetown, Africa, where she plans to spend quite a bit of time. Her 
		explanation is that Capetown is the winter resort for the British 
		society. Her life has been one of extreme sorrow, having lost her 
		husband, brothers, and other relatives in different ways. She is also an 
		expert bridge player, having taught bridge during the war to disabled 
		soldiers. She is, by the way, the last of the Barrington Footes, a most 
		prominent name in England. We expect to visit her in Kobe, where she 
		must wait for her boat to Capetown; so I will tell more of her later.<br>
		<br>During the first voyage we used the deck chairs quite a bit, 
		reading, and watching the deck games; but lately it has just been too 
		cold. Dick<br><br>(I believe there is a page missing here)<br>
		<br>put before us, and into a dish of cabbage and sauce we dipped our 
		fish. Rice, “Ebi”-prawn, “kiss,” and “Ika,” a kind of eight-handed fish, 
		were some of the assortment laid before us. When time was called, I had 
		difficulty in rising, I was so full. Back to the dining room, where 
		fruit satisfied our remaining desires.<br><br>After dinner, we 
		participated in a variety of Japanese games and tricks. I played the 
		piano while the younger son of Baron Togo played the trumpet. It went 
		off pretty well. Dick and I dance with the Baroness and her daughter, 
		both excellent dancers. About ten-thirty, Shun called us, and we 
		prepared to leave. We thanked our hosts over and over again for a lovely 
		evening in their beautiful home with the realization that we were 
		extremely fortunate in having the privilege to enter a Japanese home. As 
		we rode home with Shun, we spoke of our appreciation, and to this he 
		added “and only Rotary can do it.” We were very much impressed. We said 
		goodnight to Shun and rode home past the Imperial Palace grounds, which 
		stood out in relief in the moonlight.<br><br>This morning we are pressed 
		for time; so I must close. Dick and I are in the best of health and are 
		really having the time of our young lives. We will tell more when time 
		permits.<br><br>With best of love,<br><br>Ted<br><br>--------<br><br>N.Y.K. Line 
		One Board M.S. Hiye Maru<br><br>February 3, 1936<br><br>Dear 
		Mom, Dad, and Bruce:<br><br>I am writing this letter in the cozy smoking 
		room of our ocean caravan. It is 2 p.m. Outside the sun is shining 
		brightly, reflecting its brilliant rays off the water so that we have to 
		squint. This is the nicest day we have had since leaving Seattle. A 
		long, low line of perpendicular cliffs can be seen in the distance off 
		our starboard side. Our first glimpse of Japan came this morning when 
		Mt. Kinka-san loomed up through the haze. Since then we have passed a 
		number of fishing boats, our first glimpse of Japanese life.<br><br>I 
		was going to write this letter in -day-by-day form, referring to my 
		diary. Ted is sitting across the room writing his general impressions of 
		nothing in particular.<br><br>January 21 The McLeans were wonderful to 
		us. We were feeling pretty lonely on arriving in Seattle, but they took 
		us right in and made us feel at home. We had a luscious hamburger and 
		some new-fangled ice-cream at Broom’s. Outside, a man was tramping up 
		and down with a sign saying “Unfair to Organized Labor.” The shop had 
		already been bombed once. Mr. McLean then showed us around the city, the 
		lakes, and University of Washington gymnasium. (You could put four of 
		Stanford’s in it and two of California’s.) At 2 p.m. we got all of our 
		things ready and drove down to the boat – Mr. and Mrs. and Harriet. We 
		couldn’t see anybody but Japanese. We looked in vain for some white 
		passengers, but there seemed to be done. On going to our cabin, we found 
		it to be roomy, with three beds. We couldn’t imagine such a room for 
		“tourists.” Ted and I then had our picture taken by Mr. Pease of N.Y.K. 
		office, on top deck. Be sure to get a print of this photograph. I told 
		him to send you one through McLean. I suppose you received our newspaper 
		picture. Please write for a print of that too. Mr. McLean can get it. At 
		4 o’clock the boat backed out. There was much color as serpentine was 
		hurled back and forth, and crying of Japanese who were leaving home to 
		go a long way. The weather was very cold, and we watched a glorious 
		sunset as we glided through the channel. The food is good, and 
		everything is spick and span. Spent the evening reading.<br><br>January 
		22 We slept like logs and were awakened by room boy for breakfast. After 
		writing letters to you, we took a taxi into Vancouver (not being able to 
		find any other means of transportation). There we visited the two big 
		stores, Hudson Bay Co. and David Spencer’s. We saw beautiful skis at 
		ridiculously low prices, and we wished we could bring them along. Ted 
		bought some cough drops, and we returned to the boat by street car. At 
		12:30 p.m., our ship moved slowly from the dock. Once more the cries of 
		Japanese filled the air, and serpentine streamed back and forth. Passing 
		out the channel once more, we could see the heavily wooded sides of 
		mountains covered with snow. Our last glimpse of land came at 4 p.m. as 
		a heavy fog settled down and the ship began to roll in the open sea. A 
		hearty dinner, fifty pages of January 23 The ship here began its 
		pitching, which continues all the way. Our first pangs of nausea are 
		felt, but are cleared up by some brisk walks around “A” deck – eleven 
		times – one mile. We are pleased to find that our cabins are really 
		first-class cabins, and we also have the run of the sip. This is because 
		there is only one “first-class” passenger, a Mr. Magagown from Boston. 
		However, we eat in “tourist” dining room.<br><br>Opened our first 
		packages this morning. We sure do look forward to every new day and new 
		surprise. Dorothy Shields evidently went to a lot of trouble, too, to 
		fix her package. After breakfast, met other eight “tourists,” Mr. and 
		Mrs. Krug, a missionary and his wife going to a mission near Canton., 
		They are missionaries of the “old school” – don’t believe in movies and 
		other such pleasures. Miss Caroline Furst, a girl from Philadelphia, 
		nineteen years old, is going as an exchange student to Lingnan 
		University in Canton where Bill Lang is studying. She is full of pep, 
		lot of nerve, and is engaged to a minister. He has a job on his hands. 
		Miss Bradbury is a Canadian nurse who is going to Senelile in Japan to 
		nurse for five years. She is less than five feet tall and in a 
		profession which takes strength. Miss Gibson is a Tokyo business woman 
		who has visited in Vancouver. She is an awfully good sport and has a 
		room across from us. Mrs. Barrington Foote is a charming English widow 
		who is traveling to Cape Town and is writing a book. She has had a very 
		fully life – losing most of her family in accidents. She is very 
		entertaining and loves to talk. She is a wonderful bridge player. 
		Managed to awaken a spark in me for the game. She has given us some fine 
		bridge lessons, and we have played quite a bit. Your little book, 
		Mother, helped a good deal. Mr. Higo, a Canadian Japanese from Quebec, 
		is a swell guy. He is thoroughly Americanized and has been a fine, 
		cheerful, and thoughtful traveling companion. We all like him, and he 
		has given us a fair Japanese vocabulary. Altogether we have a fine group 
		of passengers and have had many enjoyable hours.<br><br>The ship is 
		dipping a great deal. The sun is shining, and the air is really cold. 
		Ted and I play ping pong and were taught deck golf by Captain, after 
		which we were thoroughly beaten by him and Mr. Nagagawa. In deck golf, 
		you push flat, round blocks into holes marked by chalk. By hitting each 
		other we get extra turns, etc. It is a little too difficult to explain 
		here. We rented deck chairs (one dollar) and spent most of time in them 
		– trying to keep warm.<br><br>January 24 Ted was not feeling so “hot” 
		this day. Ship rolling and pitching quite a bit. Because this is a 
		comparatively small boat, it pitches even in quiet weather. The Captain 
		says a depression is just ahead (a storm to you). All the port holes are 
		battened down with metal plates, and forward windows covered. The sea is 
		really getting rough; a strong wind is whistling through rigging. It is 
		now hard for us to keep our balance. Waves are coming over the lower 
		deck, and we are in for it. We managed to catch a few winks of sleep as 
		we rolled back and forth across our bed. We hope this doesn’t keep up.<br>
		<br>January 25 Boy, what a night! More like a log-rolling contest. 
		Everything fell all over the floor. After breakfast and a “hot” salty 
		water bath, Ted and I played some intensive ping pong. We ought to be 
		champs by the time we get to Japan. “Spot,” a Japanese boy from Seattle, 
		played with us also. After lunch we played some more deck golf with 
		Captain and Carol. The Japanese officers are a bunch of “regular 
		fellows,” especially the Captain and 1st officer. They’re both deck-golf 
		whips. The Captain spends lots of his time catching us on his card 
		tricks. He is a great big bluffer. He bluffs his way out of our tricks, 
		and if we guess his, he acts as though he doesn’t understand. Started 
		dealing out our Edy’s candy at dinner and cinema with Jack Holt, after 
		dinner.<br><br>January 26 - Sunday. We awakened about five-thirty with 
		the rolling of the sip. Managed to get along a little in my reading 
		before the Captain snared us for some golf. Mr. Nagagawa and I almost 
		took him and the Chief Engineer. At 7:45 p.m. a church service was 
		conducted by Mr. Krug. The singing went along fine until Mrs. Foote came 
		in on the high notes. It was all we could do to contain ourselves. I 
		don’t know whether I can live through another service. Mr. Krug got some 
		good practice, talking to us as if we were heathens and he was trying to 
		save our souls.<br><br>January 27 Each day we turn our watches back 
		about forty minutes. I don’t need to turn mine back; it seems to adjust 
		itself – “My Pal.” We are getting closer and closer to the Aleutian 
		Islands, and the air is getting colder and colder. Light flakes of 
		fluffy snow were falling when we came out on deck. The sea is very calm, 
		but the ship still rolls. Sunshine warmed things up a big. We made 400 
		miles yesterday, the most yet. I read the “Leica Manual,” and we had our 
		passports O.K.’d by purser at tea at 3 p.m. Our position went up several 
		notches in N.Y.K. society when we presented our gold seals to our eating 
		companions. After dinner we watched some movie comedies in the 3rd class 
		dining room. It was chuck full of tiny Japanese.<br><br>January 28 – The 
		roughest day yet. Ted is having his menu supervised by Mrs. Foote, a 
		seasoned sailor. Snow fell again this morning. We opened our packages 
		and letters about five o’clock when we awakened. Note: I continued to 
		awaken at this time, or a little later, the rest of the trip. A heavy 
		tail wind whips the spray into whitecaps as far as we can see. During 
		the evening, some large swells came over the “A” deck, laying it awash 
		in about two feet of water. No harm done. About 1 p.m. we crossed the 
		International Date Line – 180 degrees meridian. We will pick up a day 
		here, skipping tomorrow. coming back, you lose a day. Spent most of our 
		meal times chasing dishes around the table. More fun! After dinner we 
		played bridge – Ted, Carol, and Miss Gibson. Mrs. Foote helped me, and 
		we managed to win. While lying in bed, we can hear the water as it comes 
		over the side of the deck above us.<br><br>January 30 By padding 
		ourselves with pillows, we managed to keep from rolling in our beds. The 
		weather is colder than ever, and terrific, icy wind blows across the 
		decks, blowing spray with it. We studied Ely’s bridge lesson and 
		Japanese vocabulary. Took a nap in the lounge. After dinner, I made my 
		first major attack on bridge, won one rubber and am getting the hang of 
		it. Some hilarious movies followed, and then to bed for another night’s 
		roll.<br><br>Ted and I just took time out to take pictures of the 
		passengers and to go up on the bridge where we were shown how everything 
		works, by the 3rd officer, an awfully pleasant young fellow who tries so 
		hard to be nice. He taught us how to use the sextant, and we used his 
		glasses to see objects on the sore six miles away. We then came down and 
		watched our most beautiful sunset yet. The sun was a ball of red fire, 
		giving a red hue to the sky and silvery borders to the few clouds on the 
		horizon. As soon as we came back into the smoking room again, the 
		Captain speared us with some more card tricks. We’ve figured all his out 
		so far. He is a great guy – jovial and chubby.<br><br>January 31 Colder 
		than ever. Awakened about 5 a.m. and opened our packages. We tired to 
		play deck golf, but we got “cold feet” – no fooling. Mrs. Foote then 
		gave us another bridge lesson. The sukiyaki dinner was called off for 
		this evening because the ship is rolling so badly, and the dishes would 
		not stay on the Japanese tables. Sukiyaki is a famous Japanese dish that 
		all travelers have. It is made of everything. We will have to wait until 
		Tokyo now to get some. A light snowfall deposited snow on all the decks. 
		Ted and I made snowmen and had a miniature snow fight. The snow is just 
		like cotton, but slightly colder. We padded ourselves in bed for another 
		night of rolls.<br><br>February 1 Extremely cold all day as usual. Spent 
		the entire day inside. Snow covered the decks again this morning. 
		Icicles hung from the rails and rigging. I learned the last two parts of 
		Dad’s address to the Oakland Club for my talk. I am going to let the 
		rest take care of itself. Ted has his “Charge” well in hand. We read an 
		article on jade in “Asia,” written by Julian Arnold. This will provide 
		something for us to discuss with him, and maybe he can show us the 
		native shops he speaks of. About 5 p.m. the boy came into the room 
		saying that he had a telegram for me. I almost had kittens for fear of 
		hearing bad news from home, but it was just the opposite – a telegram 
		from Shun saying: “Welcome, see you on board.” We were sure happy to 
		hear such good news and can hardly wait to see what is in store for us 
		in Japan.<br><br>February 2 We awakened at 5:30 a.m. as usual. Instead 
		of lying in bed though, we dressed and went outside to watch the sunrise 
		and perhaps take a picture. To our disappointment though a coming storm 
		cut the sun from view, and we shivered in the cold. We wrote all our 
		letters this a.m. and p.m., about sixteen total, playing intensive games 
		of double solitaire with Carol for relaxation. Managed to solve 
		Captain’s hardest trick about 6 p.m. It is a dinger. The Captain said we 
		would see land tomorrow. The sea is quite a bit calmer now. Our 7:45 
		church service was carried through in fine style. Mrs. Foote was absent, 
		making things quite a bit easier for us, having only to contend with 
		Mrs. Krug’s noise (I couldn’t say voice). We are becoming more excited 
		as Nippon comes closer.<br><br>February 3 Land at last, after twelve 
		days on the anything but pacific Pacific. Ted and I are real “salts” now 
		after weathering everything with flying colors. Our first view is of Mt. 
		Kinka-san, blue and majestic in the distance. All day we have traveled 
		along the sores of Japan and will arrive in quarantine at Yokohama 
		harbor tomorrow at 7 a.m.<br><br>I’ll bet your Hot Springs trip was a 
		fine rest for you. Bruce probably put on some more pounds. Ted and I can 
		hardly wait to hear how everything is going – how Bruce’s team came out 
		against the B’s and how Stanford is doing. Before sending a letter to 
		the American Express office in a city, be sure that one is located 
		there. There is none in Tokyo, but there is one in Yokohama.<br><br>our 
		trip has been wonderful from beginning to end. Everything about this 
		ship is spick and span, and the service is A1 – these Japanese boys do 
		their work well. Ted and I are awfully lucky boys, and we know it.<br>
		<br>Jumbled Thoughts<br><br>We will write every day, and I know we will 
		have an awful lot to tell. Bruce, take good care of Mother and Dad until 
		we get home. I don’t think it is necessary to type these letters from 
		the ship. Please just keep them for reference. Our “Great Adventure” 
		really starts tomorrow, and we will go into detail from now on so that 
		the letters will be interesting to others.<br><br>The water is so calm 
		now that we barely know we’re moving. We should sleep well.<br><br>This 
		letter will have to do until tomorrow. Keep the home fires burning.<br>

		Weekly Bulletin, dated February 9, 1936, of The Tokyo Rotary Club<br>
		<br>Wednesday Meeting, February 5, 1936<br><br>President Oshima then 
		said, “We have with us most welcome guests from Oakland, California in 
		the persons of two young men, sons of Past-Governor Lyon.” He asked 
		Mizushima to introduce them to the club.<br><br>Thereupon Mizushima rose 
		and said he had no sons, so two handsome sons were sent to him by 
		Rotarian Lyon of Oakland. They are students of Stanford University and 
		quite good athletes. They are as you all see quite tall, 6 ft. 4 inches 
		in height, and they have now started on a tour round the world. Their 
		father thought it would do them more good to travel round the world than 
		to stay in the University; so they started out on the S.S. Hiye Maru of 
		N.Y.K. Line.<br><br>President Oshima rose to say that Lyon was so 
		thoughtful to have entrusted his two sons in the hands of the N.Y.K. 
		Steamship Line, and he sincerely hoped that our fellow-member Nagashima, 
		who is the Manager of the Passenger Department of N.Y.K., would do his 
		best to take good care of these two young passengers round the world. As 
		our well-known proverb says, “Let the dearest child take a trip,” they 
		will surely widen their knowledge, and finding true friends wherever 
		they go gain a deeper knowledge of “The Brotherhood of Man.” “Your 
		father, dear young men, has put you on the right track to pursuing true 
		education, and I sincerely hope that you will take good care of your 
		health and enjoy the trip.”<br><br>You Lyon then rose, and thanking the 
		President for his kind advice, said they feel so happy to reach Japan 
		and to be able to see such a beautiful snow scene. They have been so 
		hospitably welcomed by the Rotary Club of Tokyo, and they will never 
		forget the kindness shown to them by everybody here and especially by 
		Mr. Mizushima for taking them under his tender wings. His father has 
		been an ardent Rotarian for many years and they heard of his meeting Mr. 
		Mizushima in Oakland and Mr. Yoneyama in Dallas, and now they are so 
		glad to meet these gentlemen in person here in Tokyo, and to realize 
		true international friendship in Rotary.<br><br><br><br>February 6, 1936<br>
		<br>R. F. Moss<br><br>506 Sanshin Building<br><br>Hibiya, Tokyo<br><br>Dear Mr. Lyon:<br><br>At the Tokyo Rotary Club, of which I am a 
		member, I had the pleasure, yesterday, of meeting your two boys. The 
		Club gave them quite a cordial reception and Mizushima introduced them 
		with complimentary remarks both about them and you, after which Richard 
		got up and made as graceful and appropriate a little speech of 
		acknowledgment as I have ever heard from a lad of his years. They are 
		attractive boys of whom you may well be proud as you no doubt are.<br>
		<br>Our secretary will, no doubt, acknowledge their visit, but I am 
		writing separately because I know you will be glad to have my 
		impressions and because I hope, some day, some Rotarian may see fit to 
		write me a similar letter about my two boys, now in high school, one of 
		whom is also named Richard.<br><br>Sincerely yours,<br><br>(Signed) R.

		California, U.S.A.<br><br><br><br>Dear Sir,<br><br>Not only as a fellow

		N.Y.K. Line, I am pleased to advise you of the safe arrival here of your 
		sons, Richard and Harvey, by the “Hiye Maru” on the 3rd February. Shun 
		Midzushima, to whom you had written of their coming, met the boys on 
		their arrival at the quarantine anchorage, and has since been looking 
		after them. Yesterday, they were present at the meeting of the Tokyo 
		Rotary Club, and Richard delivered a very fine address in response to a 
		welcome message given by the President. I am sure they will have a very 
		interesting time here.<br><br>Shun showed me your letter to him. I do 
		not know what caused you to choose our ships for your sons’ trip both 
		trans-Pacific and via Suez. Whatever the reason, I am more than pleased 
		to know of the fact that the N.Y.K. Line enjoys so much of your 
		confidence as to have your dear sons placed under its care for their 
		first long sea-voyage. You may rest assured that you have made no 
		mistake in our choice. The boys told me that they had a very pleasant 
		voyage on the “Hiye Maru.” I am sure that they will enjoy an equally, if 
		not more, pleasant and instructive voyage on the “Hakone Maru” and “Suwa 
		Maru.” I have had special instructions issued to the commanders of these 
		ships and branch offices en route that your boys be well taken care of, 
		and be given every possible facility to make their tour interesting.<br>
		<br>I may have a further opportunity of writing you of the boy’s tour.

		<br><br>Tokyo, February 6, 1936<br><br>Dear Mother, Dad, and 
		Bruce:<br><br>Since our arrival in Tokyo day before yesterday, Dick and 
		I have been going steadily, and this morning we have a slight breathing 
		spell. Mr. Midzushima has been watching out for us wonderfully. This 
		morning a clear blue sky is overhead, and below us as I look out of the 
		window are the snow covered roofs of the Japanese stores and houses. 
		Snow is still on the streets, and the taxis and cyclers have a difficult 
		time making their way about this huge city.<br><br>It is my duty to tell 
		you of the eventful yesterday. After taking pictures of the lovely, 
		white snow effects, Dick and I left the “Y” and started out to see some 
		of the city. Down one side street we watched Japanese children making 
		their way over the slippery show to their school. It was a cheerful 
		sight. Shops along the street of many different kinds and sizes are 
		selling merchandise and food of every kind. Coolies and shop owners 
		alike were attempting to clear the snow from the sidewalks. On Ghinza 
		Street, one of the main business centers, we entered a department store 
		and made some small purchases. Then to the Union Club to meet Mr. 
		Midzushima, but as I crossed the street, we passed over an exceptionally 
		slippery area. For the first time in my life, my feet flew out from 
		under me like a shot from a gun, and I was on my back. In my 
		embarrassment I arose and nonchalantly brushed myself off. Cyclers were 
		witnessing experiences like mine frequently as they rode along.<br><br>
		At the Union Club, we were introduced to the Secretary of the Travel 
		Bureau of Japan, and then took a taxi for the Rotary club. In the fine, 
		big building where the meeting was held, we ascended to the second floor 
		and entered the lobby where the men were grouped around, talking. Our 
		first acquaintance was M. Kitishima (“Kitty”), who told us about his 
		schooling in Oakland and acquaintance with you, Dad. We then met the 
		leading business men of Japan – Mr. Fukushima of the Mitsui Company, 
		with whom we have lunch today; President of the Club, Mr. Oshima; Mr. 
		Yonoyama, Past Governor and founder of the Club; Mr. Seki, Baron Togo, 
		and others. Every member is the leader in his craft, and they had a very 
		sociable luncheon. Dick spoke a few words for both of us and was 
		complimented by many afterwards. They all seem to take quite an interest 
		in us. They complimented Dad many times in connection with his interest 
		in Rotary.<br><br>After the meeting, Mr. Yagi, whom we met at the Union 
		Club, escorted us by means of the subway to the Rotary Department Store. 
		This store is truly the most beautiful Dick or I have ever seen, all in 
		modern modeling. A few small purchases, and then to the Rotary 
		photography store. Dick and I were surprised at the excellent equipment 
		on hand in the store. We inquired about the Leica camera and bought a 
		tripod, filter, and cable release for our Kodak. We think we will wait 
		until we get to Germany to buy our camera, because of the high tariff.<br>
		<br>It was getting late; so we taxied to the Imperial Hotel, where we 
		inquired about friends from the Hiye Maru, and inquired about shirts and 
		pajamas in the Arcade. Mr. Yagi then introduced us to a Chinese tailor, 
		from whom we plan to get suits. We went to his shop, a very small 
		building a little way from the Hotel. Not having decided on a material, 
		we were pressed for time and promised to return the following day. To 
		the Union Club we hurried and arrived there about six o’clock. A taxi 
		was called, and with Shun we drove through the city to the home of Baron 
		and Baroness Togo in the old quarter of the city. The adjoining street 
		was exceedingly narrow, not having been built for automobiles but for 
		jinrikishas. The garden was snow laden and beautiful. We swung to the 
		front door, alighted, and entered the warmth of the home of the host. 
		Removing our shoes for the more comfortable slippers, we entered the 
		living room and there met Rotarian guests, some of whom we had made 
		acquaintance with earlier that day. Everything was very informal, and 
		the home, although not of true Japanese style, was beautifully decorated 
		with old Japanese pictures and pottery. Dinner was served, and we 
		stepped merrily into the ultras-modern dining room. This room had been 
		planned by the Baron’s brother who had studied architecture in Cornell 
		University.<br><br>We were seated around a long, linen covered table, 
		and before us was a wooden box with chopsticks wrapped in paper, lying 
		on its top. The box contained the deliciously arranged hors d’oeuvre of 
		many assortments. This hors d’oeuvre was made up of vegetables and fish 
		of unique Japanese names. They called one elephant ears; another, some 
		kind of devil fish; prawn of salmon; black sweet beams; cucumber; fish 
		sausage; and a variety of Japanese cabbage. The use of chopsticks came 
		to me quickly as I watched the proper technique. Everything was tasty. 
		Beer and hot saki were served with that first course. I noticed that the 
		guests across the table would get up in alternate groups and leave the 
		table. My curiosity was satisfied when my neighbor, Mr. Seki, announced 
		that it was our turn to eat tempura. Into a small alcove we stepped, and 
		there before us was a table, and behind it a big pot with a hot liquid 
		within it. A Japanese servant was cooking our food in this boiling 
		liquid, and we sat down with anticipation. The fish of different variety 
		was<br><br>[Something seems to be missing here]<br><br><br><br>Tokyo, 
		February 8, 1936<br><br><br><br>Dear Mom, Dad, and Bruce:<br><br>
		Although Dick and I have been in Tokyo but four days, we love it and its 
		people, and are having truly the time of our lives. Whenever we do 
		something in the real Japanese style, Dick and I remark to each other, 
		“Boy, would Mom and Dad eat this up!” We are truly seeing Japan in a 
		wonderful way. And it is only because of Dad’s Rotary that it has been 
		made possible.<br><br>Yesterday was a very eventful one. After a good 
		haircut and breakfast here in the Y.M.C.A., we took a taxi to the big 
		Tokyo station where the Tourist Bureau is situated. With Mr. Yagi, our 
		good friend, we started out through the snow covered streets to the 
		Mejii Shrine. A beautiful, large, untarnished torii marked the entrance; 
		and we walked through the snow covered gardens with anticipation. In 
		front of the shrine we purified ourselves by washing our mouths and 
		cleansing our hands and face in a sacred well. All was quiet as we 
		walked under the hand carved gateway and into the sacred square 
		enclosure of the shrine. Straight ahead was the offering temple. The 
		doors and outside woodwork were marred by smell indentations made by 
		thrown coins during a certain festival of the year. As we stood looking 
		into the beautiful piece of workmanship, Japanese worshipers would step 
		up beside us, throw a few sen into the temple and clap their hands two 
		or three times as they bowed. All too soon we had to leave, but a 
		definite feeling of respect for the Japanese people and their beliefs 
		was instilled in us. Everywhere the snow was lovely.<br><br>We merely 
		drove past the Unknown Soldier’s Monument Temple, but we could see at a 
		glance that it was indeed a fitting tribute to the country’s dead.<br>
		<br>As we entered the Mejii Art Gallery, we did not realize that we were 
		in for a wonderful treat. I shall not attempt to describe that beautiful 
		work of architecture and art, but I will say that in that building is 
		the most beautiful collection of art that I have ever seen.<br><br>Our 
		next destination was Asakusa-Ku, a district which compares favorably 
		with Coney Island, and in which is the Temple of Kwannon, Goddess of 
		Mercy. It would take pages and pages to justly describe that work of 
		art; so I shall not try. Along the streets of Asakusa were small shops 
		in which one could spend days examining curios and souvenirs. And it was 
		a happy sight. Everyone seemed contented with their lot.<br><br>Back to 
		the business center we came, back to modern civilization after a brief 
		audience with the ancient. Down the main street, Ghinza by name, we 
		walked to see the sights. Dick and I never seem to tire of this 
		experience although we have done it quite a few times. In every window 
		is something to catch the eye. Into an eating place we went and enjoyed 
		a real dinner for an extremely reasonable expense. A little purchasing 
		ensued, but do not be alarmed; everything is so very reasonable, one 
		cannot help himself.<br><br>Back to our Tokyo home, the “Y,” we hurried 
		in order not to be late for a six o’clock engagement. In a short time, 
		we were speeding to the home of Baron and Baroness Togo, where after 
		being received graciously by the Baroness and her young daughter, we sat 
		down to a dinner of sukiyaki (pronounced skiaki in rapid style). 
		Sukiyaki, as you know, is a combination, a variety of everything. 
		Prepared in a Japanese home, I believe this meal has a much finer 
		quality and deliciousness.<br><br>After dinner we were escorted to the 
		home of Mr. and Mrs. Watanabe, where we enjoyed a very lovely home 
		party, dancing with the Japanese girls and young ladies, who, by the 
		way, are very excellent dancers, all of them. Lovely food finished off 
		the evening entertainment with gusto, and we were two very tired young 
		men as we said goodnight in Japanese style. But we were not finished 
		yet. Baroness Togo had invited us to spend the night in her home, 
		sleeping in real Japanese style. We were overjoyed at the prospect. We 
		were ushered upstairs to our room, which was a section of a large room 
		set off by curtains to one side. On the floor were beds, but beneath our 
		bedclothes were three thin quilts which insured a good night’s sleep. On 
		top of the spotless white sheets were two huge silk covered quilts under 
		which we slid in our Japanese double kimonos. The full, straw-padded 
		pillow was comfortable enough, and we quickly drifted into slumber 
		without a sound.<br><br>It is snowing now, and we are preparing to leave 
		for Nikko. Much is in store for us, they tell us; so we are naturally a 
		bit excited. Dick and I will write every two days from now on. We find 
		that system is best. More and more every day we wish we could stay 
		longer, but since it is not possible, we are hoping that we may return 
		again to see more of Japan and its loveliness. Dick joins me in sending 
		as much love as a tongue can tell.<br><br>Love,<br><br>Ted<br><br><br>
		<br>Tokyo, February 9, 1936<br><br><br><br>Dear Mom, Dad, and Bruce:<br>
		<br>Yesterday at Nikko, we spent a most glorious morning visiting the 
		religious monuments of Shintoism and Buddhism. The effect of the snow 
		combined with the colorful shrines and temples was one of breathtaking 
		beauty.<br><br>We left the hotel early, down the winding hotel road and 
		across the bridge that spans the Daiya River. Our introduction to 
		oriental art was the red lacquered bridge, “God Bridge,” which is about 
		fifty yards above the one we crossed. The river was framed under it, and 
		beyond towered bright snow covered mountains. But on to the temples we 
		went. As we bought our tickets, a native Japanese who spoke fairly good 
		English offered his services for a small price. But we had our little 
		guide book and were confident that nothing would be missed. But as we 
		approached the Hall of Three Buddhas, a feeling of awe and helplessness 
		came over us. And to our surprise, who was patiently following us but 
		the forsaken guide. We quickly hired him and started into the first and 
		largest building in Nikko, Sambutsu-do. We must remove our shoes for a 
		heavy sock which the guide produces from a brown cloth he carries. 
		Directly in front of us as we enter is the priests’ shrine, the place of 
		prayer and offering. To one side is a colossal drum which we learn is 
		used only for ceremonials. Around the other side is the guardian of this 
		holy place, the “God of Fire.” Every temple has a guardian in the form 
		of some holy statute of a god or other being. And in the middle behind a 
		bamboo screen are the three Buddhas sitting on huge gold lacquered lotus 
		flowers. One is the Prince of Buddhas, and another is the many handed 
		God of Goodness. In each hand he holds a different object symbolizing 
		his protection of the people. Every little detail of those thirty foot 
		high figures is done by hand, and with this knowledge, one has a feeling 
		of deepest respect for the workman of many years ago. As we pass out of 
		the first of the approximately sixty places of worship in Nikko, the 
		sound of a bell reverberates around us, and we step to see a priest 
		sounding the big bronze bell on the hour. As we leave the Rinno-ji 
		temple precinct, we pass Sorento, or Evil Averting pillar, a copper 
		tower forty feet in height and eight feet in circumference. Inside this 
		structure, we are told, are hold scriptures of religious importance.<br>
		<br>Up the broad avenue between the huge Cryptomerias, cedars as we call 
		them, we hasten to the Deyasu Shrine or Tosho-gu. The huge stone torii 
		at the head of the avenue is framed by the trees on either side, and the 
		effect of the snow falling from the warm branches a hundred feet in the 
		air is one of sincere grandeur. As we pass under the torii, we catch our 
		breath, for on our left and rising one hundred and six feet above us, is 
		the five story pagoda. A close-up view presents the lacquered wood 
		carving under each of the five tiers. Dragons, fish, horses, goats, 
		dogs, and other animals of fantastic design encircle the structure under 
		the eaves. The multicolored paintings, sadly warped by many a severe 
		winter, give an atmosphere of antiquity. But all of this does not take 
		away from the wood carvings themselves, for they will stand many years 
		to come as a record of Japanese art of long ago.<br><br>Just ahead is 
		the Ni-mon gate, the first entrance to the shrine. To each side as we 
		enter, stand devil figures of large dimensions, making hideous faces in 
		us attempt to guard the entrance from Evil. And on the inside of the 
		gate are two huge dogs with colored manes, posed for the same purpose of 
		guarding the temples. Turning from the gate, the observer sees three 
		Japanese buildings. We are informed that these are the storehouses for 
		sacred costumes which are used but once or twice a year in the annual 
		festival in June. Opposite these buildings is the Sacred Stable, a 
		smaller building, but one of great importance, for under the eaves of 
		the roof are carved the three monkeys, “Neither see, hear, nor speak any 
		evil.” Further on is a cistern, where worshipers purify themselves. And 
		just above the cleansing well are some interesting objects. Besides the 
		Drum and Belfry Tower to each side are two lanterns of large dimensions, 
		one a spinning, and the other merely a hanging one. Both are done in 
		bronze and show fine workmanship. The second gate the celebrated 
		Yomei-mon, is popularly called “the gate where one tarries all day.” The 
		wood and metal work together with the intricate decorations make it one 
		of the finest gems of art in the Far East. Inside the next enclosure are 
		a variety of buildings wherein ceremonial objects are displayed.<br><br>
		The formal entrance to the main building of this area is a “White 
		Chinese Gate,” elaborately carved and lacquered in white. Contrary to 
		the others, this gate is in Chinese style. Beyond the gate are the 
		Haiden and Honden, two very elaborate structures. The Haiden or Oratory 
		Room is the outer one, the ceiling of which is adorned with a hundred 
		different dragons. Around the walls are the pictures of famous poets and 
		a proverb of each. To each side are small dining rooms in which are 
		exquisite carvings of the Phoenix. And in the center towards the back, 
		hangs a silver disk into which one looks when he kneels to pray. This 
		mirror exemplifies the Buddhist philosophy of “knowing one’s self.” 
		Beyond the Haiden is the inner Honden, the main chapel. The floor of 
		stone is supposed to be made of one huge piece of granite. To the back 
		are food offerings of rice, fish, fruit, saki, and tea. In back of the 
		offerings is a bamboo screen, behind which, not to be revealed to the 
		public, are the statues of past Shoguns of Japan. All the woodwork of 
		oak is excellently finished and is in wonderful shape.<br><br>Retracing 
		our steps through the Yomsi-mon and Nio-mon fates, and taking a last 
		look at that very impressive group of buildings, we once again wander 
		through the cryptomerias behind our guide to the Futara-san Shrine, 
		built eleven hundred years ago. From the interior, somewhere behind a 
		bamboo screen, comes a weird tune, played by a priest on a sacred 
		instrument. The construction and decoration is much plainer in this 
		shrine, and the only visible object is an offering box into which money 
		gifts have been thrown for many centuries.<br><br>Down some steps and a 
		turn right through the colossal cryptomerias brings us within sight of 
		the district of the Iemitsu Mausoleum. Climbing many steps, and after 
		passing through the guarding “Demon Gate,” Yashamon, we at last reach 
		the snow covered tomb of Iemitsu, the third Tokugawn Shogun. As we 
		return, we stop at the Oratory, in which is the spirit tablet of 
		Iemitsu.<br><br>But back to the hotel we must hasten, for it is growing 
		late; and as we walk briskly through the snow laden cryptomerias, we are 
		reminded of the story of Hansel and Gretel as they wandered through the 
		woods. Everywhere is a Christmas card scene, and we leave with the 
		feeling of deepest admiration for nature and man.<br><br>With lots of 
		love,<br><br>Ted<br><br><br><br>(Written on Letterhead of The

		almost eat them. One cannot know or say “kirci” (beautiful) until he has 
		seen the twenty-three matchless temples of great Japanese shoguns,

		home of Japan’s kindest family, the Togos. Our room was the usual 
		simple, square Japanese room, with sliding screens and straw mats. Our 
		mattresses, composed of three thick comforters, lie on the floor, and 
		covering us are three more warmer comforters. We slept like rocks, warm 
		and cozy, arising at 8 a.m. For pajamas, we wore two kimonos tied tight 
		with long sashes. In the morning we had to dress in our clothes of the 
		night before because we had not expected such good luck and had brought 
		no extra clothes. An appetizing breakfast followed after we had washed 
		and brushed our teeth with Japanese toothbrushes, long bamboo handles 
		and rather soft fibers when wet. These are also provided in all hotels 
		in Japan, along with slippers and cotton kimonos. Fruit, toast, 
		scrambled eggs and jam went down our hatches in a hurry. For fruit, we 
		had apples the size of grapefruit, and pears almost as big, along with 
		the small Japanese mandarin orange. After thanking our kind and charming 
		host and hostess, we put our shoes back on at the door, climbed into a 
		waiting car, and wound slowly through rumbling traffic to the “Y,” where 
		we found our silk shirts awaiting us, $2.28 apiece. Good shirts in 
		America are more expensive than this; so we will get a few more. They 
		are beautifully made and of fine texture.<br><br>The morning was rapidly 
		passing just as all our days in Japan have been doing. There is so much 
		to do and so little time to do it in. By twelve we had finished our 
		letters t you, just giving us time to pack our things in one of our #7 
		suitcases, pile into a cab, grab a luscious lunch at the Olympic for 
		$2.80 (or 85 cents) for two, our largest and most delicious American 
		meal in Japan. In fact, we ate so much that it was almost painful to 
		swallow that last mouthful of shortcake. By the way, strawberries in 
		Japan are four times as big as in California. This is pretty hard for us 
		“native sons,” and works havoc with our sales talks. Our feast – cream 
		of asparagus soup (a big bowl); Swiss steak with spinach, rice, 
		eggplant, celery fritter, with delicious buns; a milk shake and a real 
		strawberry shortcake. We were in the pink of condition for our surprises 
		at Nikko.<br><br>In a text again to Asakusa station in East (by north) 
		Tokyo to catch the train to Nikko. The Togos and a party of boys and 
		girls were going to Nikko for ice skating, about twenty-five of them. We 
		were invited to go along with them and were happy to accept. Mr. Yagi 
		had written down our order for tickets; so we gave it to the ticket girl 
		and held our breaths. After a number of minutes of jabbering with other 
		sales girls, we were given something which looked like it might be 
		tickets, covered with Japanese characters. By saying “Nikko” to a 
		conductor, our train was pointed out, and we climbed in the first car, 
		where, luckily, our party happened to be sitting. Just as we got in, a 
		shrill whistle blew and our train moved off.<br><br>There followed three 
		hours of delightful company with our Japanese friends. A few could speak 
		some English, and we had great fun showing each other tricks, eating 
		candy, kidding, and in between, enjoying the beautiful snow covered 
		terrain on all sides. Rice fields under a foot of snow, terraced hills 
		white with falling flakes, and muddy roads along which the ever familiar 
		bicycles pulled unwieldy loads. An occasional peasant trudging along in 
		the slush and carrying his paper umbrella, could be seen from the 
		windows of our speeding electric train – the ancient and the modern 
		working side by side in complete harmony, typical of all Japan. Everyone 
		works hard here, spurred on by the desire to show the world that the 
		Japanese race is inferior to none.<br><br>At five o’clock, our train 
		pulled into Nikko, and we piled out of the car into waiting ‘35 Dodge 
		cars which plowed through falling snow a mile of so, along Nikko’s one 
		main street, lined with curio shops designed to entice the gullible 
		tourist; garages; clothing stores, and native hotels, incidentally clean 
		and typically simple. The Kanaya Hotel was to be our residence for the 
		night. In order to reach it, our car slid back and forth in the slow, 
		chained wheels sliding but managing to bring us to our destination. Ted 
		and I were given a pleasant room overlooking a small court, and we 
		prepared for an early dinner because our friends wished to get on the 
		ice of “Lake Placid,” a beautiful outdoor rink, as soon as possible. By 
		staying with the group, we also received cheaper rates and enjoyed the 
		companionship of our Japanese friends.<br><br>Our dinner was a mixture 
		of foreign and Japanese style food. We were all provided with knives and 
		forks, but Ted and I used our chopsticks for everything just as we do at 
		all Japanese meals. Practice is making us very proficient.<br><br>Soup 
		and rice are eaten with every meal, even breakfast. Rice is eaten with 
		everything, and we drink our soup from a bowl, chopsticks for everything 
		else. Any Japanese exclamation we would make would bring much laughter, 
		and we taught them several of our “slang” words. Dainty waitresses 
		waited on our every desire and giggled when we would say “Arigoto” 
		(thank you) or “Mo takesan desu (no more, thank you).<br><br>After 
		dinner, while the others went up to the rink, Ted and I got the camera 
		and tripod and went out in search of beautiful pictures. We found 
		several in front of the hotel, produced by the lighting on the snow 
		covered trees and Japanese lamps, scenes which would be beautiful to use 
		for Christmas cards.<br><br>Ted and I were, and still are, thrilled with 
		the beauty surrounding us, wishing we could take pictures of everything. 
		After walking down the almost deserted main street of Nikko, looking in 
		all the windows and enjoying the crisp winter air, we climbed the stairs 
		leading to Lake Placid, where we found our friends executing beautiful 
		maneuvers on the ice, and our most beautiful picture. After a good deal 
		of work at clearing the snow off the ice, everyone put on their skates 
		and did some great figure skating. Ted and I asked for skates, but the 
		best they could do for us was a pair of dull ones which fit on one’s 
		shoes. As we had low shoes on, our troubles were doubled, and it was 
		with some difficulty that Ted managed to keep the family honor 
		untarnished by keeping on his feet for several turns on the ice, then 
		giving it up as a bad job well done.<br><br>After several contests, all 
		came inside and sat around the stove. Then followed an hour of Japanese 
		games. As soon as Ted and I would have them figured out, they would 
		change the game, and we would be right back where we started from. 
		Japanese boys and girls have lots of fun together. There is none of this 
		would-be sophistication which characterizes so many American young 
		people. They are always doing something to keep themselves laughing, and 
		there is no end to the games which there are to play. We Americans can 
		learn many lessons from these happy people.<br><br>Here is one of the 
		games. All sit around in a circle. One is blindfolded and spun around. 
		He then touches someone, and by asking the touched one to make certain 
		noises, guesses the individual’s name. He may ask for three noises such 
		as a dog’s bark, and may try it on three persons. If he is not right in 
		any of the three, he must then do something silly as punishment. It is 
		great fun. After eleven-thirty, a number of the boys danced a Japanese 
		dance to the music created by their own singing. Ted and I joined in and 
		soon were doing it to perfection. What fun! We felt right at home and 
		laughed and sang with them. Friendship is merely understanding one 
		another and enjoying things together.<br><br>We were two terribly tired 
		boys when we hit those beds. Sleep can wait, but our opportunities to 
		know Japan and its youth come seldom, and we must make the most of them.<br>
		<br>As I write this letter (I mean murder), it is 7:30 p.m. and is dark 
		outside, of course. Baroness and Baron Toto are seated across the aisle. 
		She is dressed in her black kimono and ebi and is holding a little boy 
		who just got on with his father. They are both wonderful people and have 
		made Japan beautiful for us. We are continually thinking of you and how 
		you would enjoy all this and know that it will not be long until you 
		can.<br><br>Your loving son and brother,<br><br>Dick<br><br><br><br>
		Tokyo, Japan, February 11, 1936<br><br><br><br>Dear Mom, Dad, and Bruce:<br>
		<br>Today we were taken to Kamakura by our wonderful friends, the Togos. 
		Without them we would have been lost. We left Shimbashi Station, Tokyo 
		early on the trail and made the hour ride to Kamakura. But to our 
		surprise, we were informed that Baron Togo was a vice-president of the 
		Admiral Togo Memorial Institution, and that we were headed for a 
		seacoast town farther on. Passing the naval base in which were many 
		ships, we stopped and walked to the memorial ship. In memory of the 
		greatest national hero, Admiral Togo, the Association had set his 
		flagship, the “Mikasa,” in concrete, next to the ocean. All historical 
		facts and scenes were royally displayed in the gun turrets and cabins. 
		We saw where the Admiral just missed death when a shell tore through the 
		floor not a foot from him. It was very educational and extremely 
		interesting. After lunch, he headed back to Kamakura. Alighting from the 
		train, we made our way to the main shrine temple in the vicinity. This 
		shrine was erected in memory of a shogun and the gods he worshiped. A 
		Japanese bridge, “Drum Bridge,” was the first object of attention. 
		Spanning a small pond, it was constructed of cement and in the peculiar 
		shape of oriental bridges. Beyond stood the shrine itself, perched on a 
		hill. Mounting the steps, we entered and gave our offering of a few sen 
		into the sacred money box. As we came out, pigeons were everywhere, and 
		it was a very happy sight to see the children playing with them.<br><br>
		Our second goal was the daibutsu of Kamakura. We approached it from a 
		distance, and it was an unusual experience. So stately that Buddha met. 
		As we approached, it grew larger until we stood at its foot and looked 
		up until its huge eyes. Made of bronze which was green with age, it 
		stood 12.89 meters or 42 feet high. We learned that for a small fee we 
		might go inside. Baroness Togo leading the way, we entered, to find the 
		structure to be hollow with a ladder mounting to windows at the back. 
		Sacred treasures were displayed in a case, and on the bronze wall was a 
		sign reading:<br><br>“Stranger, whosoever thou art and whatsoever they 
		creed, when thou enterest this sacred statue remember that this is a 
		Tathagata Garba, the womb of coamical body, and should be entered with 
		reverence and not contamination. By Order of the Prior.”<br><br>These 
		were surely unusual words.<br><br>As we left we had a feeling of 
		satisfaction in having seen another of the sacred memorials of old.<br>
		<br>With much love,<br><br>Ted<br><br><br><br>Tokyo, February 13, 1936<br>
		<br><br><br>Dear Mom, Dad, and Bruce:<br><br>Today is the thirteenth. 
		Tomorrow we must leave, and we are sincerely sorry to do so. Yesterday 
		we attended the Rotary meeting. We met “Kitty” again and said hello to 
		many men to whom we had already been introduced. Later we were formally 
		introduced as visitors. The meeting was excellent, especially one speech 
		or talk that was given by a Mr. Frazier, who although not a Japanese, 
		has lived her for sixty-two years. Through his talk, we were informed 
		that his house had burned down due to a faulty high powered wire. 
		Everything had been lost, just as it had in the 1923 earthquake, except 
		a pair of cuff links with the Rotary wheel symbol on them, which he had 
		been given by the Tokyo Rotary Club. Of course he said he was very 
		grieved at the loss until he began receiving letters of condolence from 
		Rotary members. And we were very much moved when he stated that he felt 
		as though he were a rich man again, not in money, but in friendship. And 
		later he told me that if he had to choose between his property and his 
		friends, there would be no doubt in his mind as to how to make the 
		choice. Several things we noticed during the meeting. One was that 
		instead of long tables where you gt to know only those beside you, the 
		seating was around tables seating about twelve. This seemed to us to be 
		a more satisfactory arrangement. They opened the meeting with a song in 
		Japanese, which we naturally stumbled through with them. Then each 
		member who had had a birthday during the week wa called on, and he would 
		rise with one candled cake in his hands. Visitors were introduced, a 
		club yell ensued, and reports from committees was had. The main part of 
		the meeting was made up of a group of short talks by members, such as 
		Mr. Frazier’s. After the meeting, Dick and I met prominent Rotarian 
		visitors from Ozaka and Kyoto. By the way, Shun and Baron Togo have 
		given us letters to prominent people in those cities we shall visit – 
		Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe.<br><br>The early part of the afternoon was spent 
		going through the Mitsui Trust Company Building. It is colossal. The 
		Mitsui Company is surely a massive corporation. After talking a bit with 
		Mr. Fukushima, who is head of the research department and a Rotarian, we 
		inspected the Mitskoshi Department Store. Although not directly 
		connected with Mitsui, it was once part of it. It is the largest and 
		most beautiful department store building in Tokyo.<br><br>Then we 
		hastened to Ghinza, the main business street, and did some purchasing. 
		Back to the Y.M.C.A. for dinner, and we were then asked to say a few 
		words at a Japanese student English conversation class. Dick and I 
		talked to them and gave our ideas as best we could. It was interesting. 
		I have just told of yesterday.<br><br>This morning we talked to the 
		Secretary to the Governor of Rotary of this district, Mr. Shiba We had 
		quite a discussion. Later to the bank, and finally to lunch with the 
		Baroness Togo. In the afternoon, we visited the Imperial University with 
		the President of the Rotary Club, who is head of the Chemical 
		Engineering Department. It was interesting, but of course the apparatus 
		was a bit confusing and complicated.<br><br>This afternoon we said 
		goodbye to Shun, and we thanked him for his kindness. It is due to him 
		that we have had the marvelous educational as well as entertaining 
		experience.<br><br>This evening we said goodbye to the Togos and also 
		expressed our gratefulness to them for their kindness. It has surely 
		been a revelation, and we are sorry to leave.<br><br>With much love,<br>
		<br>Ted<br><br><br><br>Tokyo, February 11 and 14, 1936<br><br><br><br>
		Dear Mom, Dad, and Bruce:<br><br>Today is our eighth day in Tokyo. We 
		should have been on our way to Kobe yesterday, but everyone has been so 
		kind to us and there is so much more to see that we hate to break away. 
		The weather is really cold today, and roof tops below us are covered 
		with a thin matting of snow. Today is a famous Japanese holiday – 
		Constitution Day, celebrating the anniversary of the Emperor’s ascension 
		to the throne. There will be no brilliantly colored parades or special 
		“Fourth of July” talks. Strange as it may seem, on such days, girls 
		graduating from dancing and dramatic schools put on programs in Tokyo’s 
		numerous auditoriums. We will not be able to witness these shows because 
		we are going to Kamakura, Tokyo’s summer seaside resort to see the great 
		Diabotsu Buddha. The Togos called up this morning and said that they 
		would like to go also; so our trip will be more interesting and 
		educational than ever, with their help.<br><br>February 10 Yesterday, 
		February 10, was a shopping day for us; so I will not be able to tell 
		you of any new glories of Tokyo save the “Girls’ Opera” to which we were 
		taken by Mr. Nagashima, Rotarian, and Manager of Passenger Division of 
		the Tokyo N.Y.K. office, last evening.<br><br>We started our day off 
		with a bang by getting on the wrong street car, which took us several 
		blocks out of our way before stopping and giving us a chance to get off. 
		Everywhere we go, because of our height, we stand head and shoulders 
		above our Japanese friends, and the street car is no exception. When we 
		ask about the cause of the small Japanese stature, we are told that 
		Japanese children in the past have always kneeled and squatted on the 
		floor, and in poorer houses, huddled around the small brazier heated 
		with charcoal, which was the houses’ only means of warmth. This 
		condition exists even today in the poorer homes, but for the most part, 
		chairs are being used now, and better heating systems, in the homes of 
		those fortunate enough to have the means; so that Japanese youth is 
		growing taller, an average measure of one inch in the last seven years. 
		it is interesting to know, however, that the army prefers men to be 
		small in stature because it gives the small men an advantage in 
		quickness and agility over his large and clumsy foe. The small man also, 
		quite naturally, is a harder target to hit.<br><br>Yesterday morning, 
		Baroness Togo was again kind enough to help us with our shopping, taking 
		us about in her hired car (it is much cheaper to hire one than own one 
		in Tokyo), and giving us her advice and opinions on prospective 
		purchases. At 10:30, we had our fitting for our new suits. They will be 
		double breasted and are of a light material which will be well suited to 
		warm climates and at home. Ted’s is a light gray, and mine is light 
		brown, with straight line patterns. We are very pleased with them. As 
		you may imagine, very few people working in these stores can understand 
		English; so without the Baroness’ aid, we would be lost. Whenever she 
		goes out with us, she wears her kimonos, ebi, and padded slippers. I 
		can’t imagine anything more comfortable.<br><br>The day was the usual 
		rush in order to do everything and keep our dates with Rotarian friends. 
		At 5:30, we went by the Union Beer Hall to get Shun and the tickets. As 
		the show would soon start and he was not ready, we took our tickets and 
		hurried on to our evening’s entertainment, “The Girls’ Opera.” This show 
		is very famous in Japan, and should be so around the world. There is not 
		a male member of the show. Girls take men’s parts and carry everything 
		off swell. The costumes and scenery are elaborate, with every sixty 
		girls in each show. These girls are really dance students from the 
		Takarazuka School of Dancing in Osaka. There are several shows out all 
		of the time, moving around from city to city, playing a month at a time, 
		and to packed houses. I could hardly believe that they were all Japanese 
		girls because their features, in many cases, were occidental, and many 
		were beautiful, especially those who took the boys’ parts. Of course the 
		whole production was in Japanese, but we enjoyed every minute of it.<br>
		<br>The show was really a series of five sketches, which are enclosed. 
		Due to a lack of time because we are just getting ready to leave for 
		Kyoto, and we are already several days behind schedule, I will not be 
		able to go into detail. The entire opera lasted until 10 o’clock. At 
		7:30, we had dinner, between sketches, in one of he numerous eating 
		houses inside the theater. All types of shops can be found on any of the 
		building’s five floors, and any kind of food can be found. The “Girls’ 
		Opera” would make a great hit in the United States, not as a road show, 
		but as an education in the harmony between the ancient and the modern 
		ideas which exist in Japan. After the show, Mr. Oyama, a Stanford and 
		Berkeley man, Mr. Nagashima’s assistant, saw us to a cab and back to the 
		Y.M.C.A., two awfully tired boys, but contented with a fine evening’s 
		entertainment.<br><br>Ted and I can hardly wait to get to Shanghai and 
		read our letters from you. We presume that you have sent them there 
		because none have arrived here. We hope that all of you are taking up 
		golf in a big way.<br><br>Your loving son and brother,<br><br>Dick<br>
		<br><br><br>Kyoto, Japan, February 16, 1936<br><br><br><br>Dear Mom, 
		Dad, and Bruce:<br><br>This manuscript is being written on real Japanese 
		letter paper in a real native hotel room. Yesterday we told our good 
		Rotarian friend Mr. Shimomura that we wished to stay in a Japanese hotel 
		this evening. He led us to this, the Rotarian hotel, and we are 
		comfortably situated in our native quarters. It is rather uncomfortable 
		to be writing on a low, highly polished table, but he floor cushion is 
		soft and our charcoal heater beside me is warm. Yesterday we visited the 
		old Capital Imperial Palace. When Tokyo was named capital in place of 
		Kyoto, the royal family moved to Tokyo. Some moving job! But every now 
		and then the Emperor and his one hundred odd attendants visit here and 
		stay at this historical spot. A high wall surrounds the royal home, and 
		on each of the four sides are large impressive gates, done in the finest 
		by the finest. Situated in the center of Kyoto, it consumes many acres, 
		and as one enters, everything is clean and rather new looking. We 
		relinquish our shoes for leather slippers and following a guide, start 
		on our tour of inspection. We pass down a long hallway, the floor of 
		which is highly polished and lacquered wood. Since it is so smooth, it 
		is easy to slide our leather slippers along as well come to the first 
		rooms, waiting rooms for the nobles who are about to have audience with 
		the Emperor. There is no object in the room; but we learn that this is 
		the stork room, for many storks are painted on the paper walls. The 
		stork symbolizes long life. Adjoining it and in the same barren style is 
		the tiger room, around which are painted the figures of tigers. Since 
		there are no tigers in Nippon, these figures, we learn, were drawn from 
		the imagination. Further on is the dining room. The Emperor never eats 
		with his guests, but he sits at the head as a royal host and sees that 
		they are well taken care of. Afterwards he retires to his quarters to 
		dine. We are informed that the architecture is of Shinto and that 
		peculiarly enough, the roofs are made of cedar bark, tightly compressed 
		to make a very sturdy, weatherproof shelter. The largest and most 
		impressive room is the coronation room, in which are the thrones for the 
		Emperor and Empress. Done in red and gold with brass work adorning it, 
		the throne makes a very royal impression in one’s mind. Standing above 
		the throne and its purple curtain folds is the royal Phoenix, the symbol 
		of wealth and happiness, and molded many times in the woodwork is the 
		chrysanthemum, of sixteen petals, which is the Imperial crest. The 
		Emperor’s private suite opens upon the courtyard where festivals are 
		presented in his honor. Three of the royal rooms are the day room, 
		reception room, and bedroom; all with straw matting on the floors and 
		noted paintings on silk hanging around the walls.<br><br>Near the center 
		of the palace is the garden. Evergreens overhang the ice covered pond, 
		and small islands with stunted pine trees and Japanese stone lanterns on 
		them seem to float above the ice. It is indeed a royal garden.<br><br>We 
		leave the old Nippon Palace by the western gate and turn toward the city 
		once again.<br><br>Must leave for my first Japanese bath now, but shall 
		continue soon.<br><br>Sending much love,<br><br>Ted<br><br><br><br>
		Kyoto, Japan, February 15, 1936<br><br><br><br>Dear Mom, Dad, Bruce:<br>
		<br>Ted and I are now sitting in the lobby of the Kyoto Hotel writing 
		our letters. Last night we arrived here about 9:20 and were met at the 
		station by a representative of the Japan Tourist Bureau and a car from 
		this hotel, the manager of which is a Rotarian but is now in Tokyo, to 
		our disappointment.<br><br>Yesterday, with Yamada’s help, we managed to 
		get our last minute obligations settled and to get to the station where 
		our train was to leave for Odawana and Myanashita at 9:55 a.m. There we 
		bade “Aloha” to Mr. Yagi, Mr. Oyama, Mr. Yamada, and Mr. Nagashima of 
		N.Y.K. Our trail, a crack Japanese express, pulled out right on time, 
		and we rolled away to new experiences. Since there were very few people 
		in our comfortable second-class coach, we had the car most to ourselves. 
		Our train was the usual electric type, but would have steam power from 
		Numadzu on. <br><br>The first leg of our journey took us to Yokohama, 
		the backyards of frail, paper shuttered houses staring us in the face. 
		Here and there a small cemetery filled a backyard, and smoke belching 
		factories popped up every now and then. Across the River Tama, through 
		Kawasaki and Taurund to Yokohama, and a few minutes stop at the station 
		where shrill voice vendors rushed about selling oranges and tea to the 
		train’s occupants.<br><br>Yokohama to Odawana, our first glimpses of 
		Japanese rice fields, which would accompany us all through Japan. A 
		light matting of snow, many days old now, covered the terraced fields as 
		they spread across the hillside. Every available piece of tillable land 
		is used in Japan because of the great need for food, and especially 
		rice, which is eaten with every meal, and in some cases in every meal. 
		These fields are laid out in neat squares extending as far as the eye 
		can see. Planting will not begin for months; so the fields lie idle with 
		dead stalks standing in symmetrical order. Here and there, the green 
		leaves of vegetable plants can be seen, another staple crop of Japan.<br>
		<br>Several minutes out of Yokohama, we receive our first view of 
		Fujisan or Fujiyama as it is known in America. San means honorable, and 
		the mountain is spoken of as the honorable Mt. Fuji. It is just as 
		painters have pictured it, snow covered all its sides which are bare of 
		vegetation. We will see Fuji for many miles now as we rumble along 
		besides it and beyond to our southern destination.<br><br>At Ofuna, 
		Japan’s new Hollywood, a modern Kwannon, massive and beautiful, is being 
		constructed on a small hill overlooking the city. Kwannon is the Goddess 
		of Mercy and should not be confused with the great bronze statute of 
		Buddha which stands in Kamakura, the summer seaside resort of Japan, 
		with the dream isle of Enoshima which rises out of the Pacific a short 
		distance out.<br><br>We are surely passing through the Japan we read 
		about in story books, and as Lafondes Hearn describes to us. Flimsy, 
		unpainted, thatched roof houses are scattered among the submerged rice 
		patches. Here and there small groups of homes, better fit to stand the 
		hurricanes and earthquakes prevalent in Japan, with tile roofs of many 
		colors and picturesque gardens surrounding, quite a feeling of 
		permanency. Evidently today is washday, for brightly colored kimonos 
		hang suspended on long bamboo poles stretched between the eaves of 
		curling Japanese roofs. While on the subject of roofs, it is an 
		interesting fact that the Japanese tile is laid just the opposite from 
		American tile, and it is possible to buy tiles in many designs.<br><br>
		At Olso and Kozu, we pass close to the sea, rolling over great alluvial 
		fans which spread out from valleys in the coastal hills and mountains 
		which extend along Fuji-san’s base.<br><br>At Odawana, we pile off the 
		train, each of us carrying his well filled Japanese suitcase. Our modern 
		American made machine carried us along well paved roads, bordered with 
		more squat peasant houses and neat rice fields. Very few peasants toiled 
		in the fields because harvesting season had not yet come. Soon our 
		highway loses its smoothness, and we bounce back and forth along a 
		narrow dirt road fairly cut out of perpendicularly cliffs, Fuji’s 
		foothills. Up, up, we go, climbing a high mountain divide in order to 
		reach our destination, Numadzu, where we will again take our train; and 
		to see Mt. Fuji from the most advantageous points. As we climb, our 
		mountain caravan straining with the steep assent, far below, hundreds of 
		feet straight down, a small mountain stream cascades over smooth 
		boulders and rack spillways constructed by man to lessen the water power 
		in flood time. From time to time, our modern vehicle would pass Japanese 
		coolies, straining with heavy loads against the grades, wearing for 
		coats the traditional “hapy” or “happy coat” as called by the Ex-Price 
		of Wales when we visited Japan several years ago. At 12:15 we arrived at 
		Myanashita, one of Japan’s finest tourist hotels, and most popular 
		because here is the base for all admirers of Fuji-san. Our bus 
		conductor, a plump Nipponese girl dressed in uniform and cap, her hands 
		calloused, probably from hard work in the fields, cries in a shrill 
		voice for tickets, which she takes as we climb down, suitcases in hand, 
		for a hurried land at the Fugya Hotel. Since we only had fifty minutes 
		between busses, our truly delicious meal was quickly eaten, served by 
		trim waitresses dressed in kimono and obi, in a strictly modern and 
		beautiful dining room. Lunch over, we rushed down to the bus, just in 
		time to catch it.<br><br>For eight miles, we wound back and forth up the 
		steep, narrow, twisting road to Lake Hakone, clear as a mirror, green 
		with depth, casting reflections of Fuji and surrounding hills, up into 
		our eyes. Snow was on all sides of us, resting in the shadows of scrawny 
		pines where the sun’s warmth was not yet felt. Hakone Hachi, a small 
		mature town on Lake Hakone, is one of the favorite spots for 
		photographers, sketchers, and painters of Fujiyama because it is from 
		such spots as this that the sacred mountain’s reflection in the water is 
		most clear.<br><br>As we drove up to Mayanashita, our main view of 
		Fuji-san was unobstructed, but here at Lake Hakone, several billowy 
		clouds are moving slowly across the face of the mountain, spoiling any 
		chances we might have to catch Fuji-san in its greatest beauty.<br><br>
		At Hakone we were to change busses, and there we had our closest call 
		with old man “Catastrophe.” In order to make our train at Numadzu, many 
		miles away, we would have to leave Hakone by the next bus, which, 
		according to our schedule, was to set out right away; but we were told 
		in a roundabout way by one of Hakone’s few English speaking persons that 
		the next bus would not leave for an hour or so. If it hadn’t been for 
		some tall talking by the main hotel manager, and for the bus company’s 
		desire to please, we would still be there, I believe. Our bus driver and 
		feminine conductor were not the least displeased by the order to drive 
		many more hard miles over bad roads, but they smilingly helped us in, 
		and we were off again.<br><br>More miles of bumpy road. Every now and 
		then we were able to catch a quick glimpse of stately Fuji. Small 
		shrines tucked back into tiny valleys, native cemeteries with rock 
		carvings of gods for gravestones, and at intervals, standing at the side 
		of the road, covered with dust and scarred and broken from age, small 
		statues of Jizo, God of Little Children, stand; and around them, dust 
		covered pebbles are piled high, offerings by children for their infant 
		friends who have been taken from them. Several times we pass through 
		long rows of cryptomeria. Little children carrying their brothers or 
		sisters, smaller yet, on their backs, horses and oxen weighted down with 
		great loads of straw, so much in fact that the animal was smaller than 
		its load, passed us many times going in the opposite direction.<br><br>
		Halfway down, we were met by a ‘26 Buick touring car with uniformed 
		driver and ticket girl. This was to be our bus to Numadzu, so in we 
		jumped, and off we sped along bumpy roads to Numadzu, old Japan 
		prevailing in the outer settlement, with the modern Japanese life 
		centered around the town’s main street and railway station.<br><br>There 
		has just been a slight intermission while Dick has gone to sleep in his 
		Japanese bed on the floor. He is now kneeling, uncomfortably, on a 
		Japanese chair, a large pillow, and is writing from its shiny surface of 
		a square wood table standing one foot and a half high. He hopes you have 
		not gone to sleep yet while trying to decipher this unparalleled 
		monstrosity of literature and penmanship.<br><br>Our crack express train 
		pulled out of Numadzu right on the dot. The car was crowded; so we 
		plumped down into two available spaces beside Japanese gentlemen (we 
		hope so!). My traveling companion was a squat, chubby, kimonoed 
		Nipponese, with practically no hair on his head, who said nothing, 
		munched small mandarin oranges, and sipped Japanese tea (a very loud sip 
		in fact), which he bought at every station. Ted was more fortunate and 
		managed to have a little conversation with a student from Kyoto 
		University. Down the aisle from us, a gray haired, determined looking 
		woman would fill her long slim Japanese pipe with tobacco and take a few 
		puffs. The bowl of a Japanese pipe is so small that after several puffs, 
		it must be filled again.<br><br>Looking out of the windows, rice fields 
		stretched in all directions, with their raised borders arranged in 
		straight lines extending for miles. Very often we would rush past large 
		patches of tea, new green and ripening. Tea plants look very much like 
		low American hedges, and picking will start in the spring. Just as with 
		rice, tea terraces cover the steep sides of hills. These hillside fields 
		are built up and held by rock walls, laboriously carried up from the 
		valleys by peasant men and women. Thatched roofed houses and rows of 
		vegetables with small sticks and banners sticking up here and there to 
		frighten away birds, are now common to our foreign eyes. As the sun 
		slowly sets over western mountains, peasants are toiling in the fields, 
		harrowing with primitive and modern tools. Women swing cumbersome 
		Japanese hoes. They are swung up and down, the digging caused by the 
		force of the hoe’s fall. Men used modern hoes, and in some few cases, a 
		horse pulled a modern harrow, probably for the wealthy farmers.<br><br>
		As night slowly fell, ancient pagodas appeared silhouetted against the 
		sky, overlooking the toil of years going on in the shadowed valleys. 
		Modern Japan, happily for romantic travelers such as we, has not lost 
		the flavorings of its past ages and has not yet thrown off the yoke of 
		labor, which gives to Japan a civilization and culture all its own.<br>
		<br>At 9 p.m., we were met at the Kyoto station by a car from the Kyoto 
		Hotel, Rotarian owned and managed, and taken to our home for the next 
		two days. This traveling in Rotarians’ company, I’m afraid, is an 
		expensive proposition. We will tell you more about it. Until tomorrow,<br>
		<br>Lots of love,<br><br>Dick<br><br><br><br>Nara, Japan, February 17, 
		1936<br><br><br><br>Dear Mom, Dad, and Bruce:<br><br>When you receive 
		this installment of a couple of bums’ world tour, we will be probably 
		somewhere in the vicinity of Hong Kong. We shall be hoping that you are 
		in the best of health and making something out of these swiftly written 
		letters.<br><br>This morning we left our native hotel in Mr. Shimomura’s 
		car. He has been very kind to us, and we thanked him appreciatively as 
		we got on our train for Nara. Before, at the station we met a boy from 
		Louisiana. He has been eight months from home traveling through China, 
		India, and all points east, and was very enthusiastic at meeting fellow 
		natives. We were in a hurry and could learn no more about him other than 
		that he will be in Hong Kong at the time we are. Therefore, we shall see 
		him there.<br><br>Leaving Kyoto on the crowded electric car was not very 
		impressive. The day has been very cloudy, much to the consternation of 
		our camera and photo-meter. The people on the car were extremely 
		interesting, of a much poorer type than those we had seen in our short 
		stay. One old lady hobbled to a seat, sat down, and paid for her fare 
		out of an old cloth which was her purse. In an effort to get 
		comfortable, she drew her feet out of her shoes, and as she nestled them 
		under her on the seat, her stockings were worn through at the sole, and 
		mud was caked on the ankles. A glance down at the shoes found them 
		somewhat fille with straw. With her kerchief over her head and her old 
		coat around her shoulders, she seemed pathetic in her poverty.<br><br>
		Another person across from us was some priest with a kind wrinkled face; 
		and an odd sort of hat, something like a Scotch bagpipe hat, sitting 
		atop his close shaven head. As we watched him, he drew from within his 
		black cloak a small metal box and a leather bag and pipe case. From the 
		pipe case, he withdrew a long stick with a metal cup at one end. Into 
		this small cup, he stuffed some tobacco, and he lighted this contraption 
		in the metal box by use of a match. All this preparation seemed to be 
		wasted when we observed that only three puffs would consume his pipeful. 
		This indulgence is quite common in native Japan.<br><br>We arrived in 
		Nara about eleven o’clock and had our first jinrikisha ride. Getting 
		into the compartment is quite a feat for one of our stature, for the 
		seat is not large enough and the rikisha rests at a steep angle. Once we 
		are safely settled, the coolie steps inside the drawing arms, and up and 
		away we go. To us, being rather young, the rikisha was a novelty, but 
		after a while we are content to walk. Our coolie is about half our size 
		and weight, yet he does a good job.<br><br>We have heard much of the 
		wonder and fame of Nara, and after we have it ourselves, we agree that 
		in view of its tremendous age and history, Nara is indeed a real place 
		of interest. But we have been spoiled by Nikko, and therefore it is not 
		easy to see Nara in its true self.<br><br>The first object of interest 
		is the Kasuga shrine, approached along an avenue flanked by stone and 
		metal lanterns numbering about three thousand, which are lighted only on 
		February 3 (when winter yields to spring). The Kasuga proper is in 
		reality one of a group of shrines, all in orange and gold, but in a 
		different, new architecture, one which is hard to describe. The shrines 
		were founded in A.D. 768, and each is dedicated to a separate deity. In 
		the garden of the main shrine is a very unusual tree, a combination of 
		many species of tree. It is thought of as reminder that the many 
		religions of the world should live together in peace and harmony.<br>
		<br>Arond the San-gwatsu-do, third month temple, and Nigatsu-do, second 
		month temple, famous for its small copper image of the “Eleven-faced 
		Kwannon” (never shown), popularly believed to be warm to the touch, are 
		fruit trees. And on some of the trees are tied pieces of paper. Upon 
		inquiry, we learn that these are the symbols of bad fortunes the people 
		have left on the trees in an attempt to gain good luck.<br><br>Beyond 
		this area is “the big bell,” cast in 752 A.D. The third largest in 
		Japan, it weighs about 48 tons. Further on is the Daibutsi-den or “Hall 
		of the Great Buddha.” As we approach, it seems to grow until it attains 
		huge dimensions. Because of the many winters and storms, the paint is 
		pretty well gone, but the construction is still present, and that is 
		what is unbelievable. Inside is the bronze image of Buddha, the largest 
		image in Japan. He is sitting on an open lotus blossom in an attitude of 
		calm reflection. It was erected in 749 A.D. and contains 437 tons of 
		bronze, 288 pounds of gold, 7 tons of vegetable wax, 165 pounds of 
		mercury, and several thousand tons of charcoal. The gold and mercury are 
		used solely for gilding. Then into meditation while waiting for the 
		future Buddha. His grave is the mecca of worshipers who come from every 
		direction to pray before his tomb, Shingon believers worship Kobo Daishi 
		as an incarnation of the Buddha.<br><br>When Koya-san was in its prime 
		there are said to have been from 2,000 to 9,000 temples, but now there 
		are only about 100. We were staying at probably the most widely known 
		monastery, Shojoshin-in.<br><br>After breakfast we left our lodging and 
		entered the famous cemetery which lies to either side of the broad 
		avenue one and one-half miles long, through cryptomeria and hinoki 
		trees. Monuments to priests, warriors, famous men of the past, and 
		Shingon worshipers of every size and form surrounded us as we walked 
		down the stone avenue with our friend. He told us of this stone and that 
		monument. One row as set aside for geisha girls. Across the way was the 
		tomb of some famous monk. At the end of the cemetery was the grave of 
		Kobo Kaishi where lights and incense are always burning and devotion is 
		offered constantly. In a separate enclosure near Kobo Daishi’s tomb are 
		candles which may be lit by pilgrims in memory of the dead, a pious 
		offering in the eyes of Buddhists. To the back of this building are two 
		candles burning: one, that of the Emperor Shirakawa, which has been 
		burning constantly since 1023, and the other the lamp of a poor woman 
		who cut off her hair in order to sell it to get money for one lamp.<br>
		<br>To one side of the Tomb of Kobo Daishi is a receptacle into which 
		followers may have their ashes put after death. At a certain time, these 
		ashes are gathered together and molded into a statue of Buddha.<br><br>
		The cemetery was surely a thing to marvel at, and as we made our way 
		back to the monastery, I wondered at the sincerity and power of Buddhism 
		in the Orient.<br><br>As we hurried to our bus over the frozen ground, 
		we were sorry we could not have stayed longer, for there is much to see 
		in Koya-san. And we recalled a few incidents that had made impressions 
		on us. First, we were surprised when the young monk who was our friend, 
		brought toast and eggs to us in the morning along with our Japanese 
		food. And second when the same person smoked cigarettes in the cemetery. 
		And third we realized that rikishas were not for us, for they are too 
		slow, and when a coolie who weighs just half as much as we do tried to 
		pull us over that snow, we wanted to get out and help him.<br><br>One 
		other thing we realized was that the spring or summer time was the 
		proper season to see Koya-san. We could not fully enjoy its gardens and 
		quiet beauty as it lay under the ice. Therefore we plan to return. This 
		time was merely an introduction.<br><br>Much has been written of 
		Koya-san by visitors who have been duly impressed, but it is for the 
		artist to write about, not me. I have merely given a brief idea of what 
		Koya-san means to us.<br><br>We returned to Kobe and enjoyed a wonderful 
		sukiyaki dinner as guests of the N.Y.K. Company. They have been 
		wonderful to us, and we shan’t forget them.<br><br>Love to all,<br><br>
		Ted<br><br><br><br>Nara Hotel, Nara, Japan, February 17, 1936<br><br>
		<br><br>Dear Mom, Dad, Bruce, Elizabeth, Ching:<br><br>As I write this 
		great contribution to the literary world, “Oscar,” He of the Lion-Heart, 
		site placidly before me, unmoved, giving me inspiration. Oscar is the 
		newest addition to the Lyon family, and we thought that we should inform 
		you of this. Oscar’s heart is really made of stone, but he is not a bad 
		short at all. In fact, he is fashioned from pure Canadian agate – at 
		least we were told by the shopkeeper who asked Y3.80 for it, but sold it 
		to us for Y2.50 (75 cents) after some honest-to-goodness haggling. Oscar 
		is our steadfast friend, and we hope he will stick by us and bring us 
		good luck on our travels. He ought to – he’s getting a free trip.<br>
		<br>To get down to business though, yesterday the greatest of Kyoto’s 
		temples opened their doors to us. I say, “the greatest,” because Kyoto 
		or Kioto (old spelling) is certainly the “city of temples” – shrines on 
		every street, all hanging with votive offerings from pilgrims. Our 
		entire trip was made on bicycles which we rented from our hotel, and we 
		pedaled many miles in order to see all of the shrines situated on the 
		city’s outskirts. Ted has told you of the city; so I will merely speak 
		of the temples, of which there is plenty to say. Kyoto is “old Japan.” 
		Everything about it is old. Its temples are the oldest, its mode of 
		dress is the quaintest, and many of its shops and streets have not as 
		yet been touched by the changes in new Japan. Kyoto and Nara are cities 
		we travelers dream about and are not disappointed upon seeing.<br><br>
		Sanju-Sangendo or “Hall of 33 Ken” is our first temple of the day. It is 
		sometimes called by the latter name because of the 33 spaces between the 
		34 front pillars, these spaces called by Japanese measurement, ken. 
		Sanju-Sangendo is a Buddhist shrine dedicated to Kwannon, Goddess of 
		Mercy. There are many temples to Kwannon, but this is the most famous 
		because it houses 1,001 images of the Goddess. The building itself is 
		very plain, badly weathered and unpainted, and our first impression of 
		this 396 foot long structure is very disappointing, but after paying 20 
		sen admittance, removing our shoes, and padding along in stocking feet 
		which soon became as cold as the bare lacquered floors, any hopes which 
		we might have had are fully realized by the beauty of workmanship 
		resting before our eyes. Row upon row of golden images, possessing many 
		hands, each hand holding some religious object significant of Buddha’s 
		many merciful acts of saving, always a hand to help those in need.<br>
		<br>(Note) Five days have passed, and I will continue writing on the 
		Hakone-Maru as we leave Japan behind us and ply towards China. I hope my 
		memory does me well so I can recall our experiences in Kyoto temples. 
		Please excuse my wanderings.<br><br>The striking quality of this great 
		temple is the fact that the features of the 1,001 Kwannons are almost 
		identical. They vary only in their costumes and in objects held in their 
		hands. If I were a drinking man, I would surely think that I had passed 
		my limit on seeing this mass of similar images. I hope the enclosed 
		picture will give you an idea of what I cannot describe with words. In 
		the center of the hall site the main statue of Kwannon, a large, golden 
		Buddha, sitting placidly on a still larger, golden lotus flower. 
		Kwannon’s features possess the quiet and serenity of Buddhism, and she 
		towers over the row upon row of small, upright images at her side. 
		Before Great Kwannon, stands the usual plain, red, lacquered altar 
		trimmed with golden damascene. A simply clad priest kneels and chants 
		before the altar as he offers sacred incense to the Goddess, while 
		behind him, black kimonoed pilgrims toss pennies into the offering box – 
		music to temple ears. We could stay here all day admiring Kwannon’s 
		beauty, but we must be off, for Kyoto is full of just as beautiful 
		temples, they say. So we shake off peddlers selling rosaries and 
		postcards, and ride off down the street to our next adventure, Chion-in 
		Monastery, one of Kyoto’s greatest claims to fame.<br><br>Chion-in’s 
		impressive entrance puts one in the right mood to receive the beauty to 
		follow. A great gate, unpainted, and beaten with age, but still 
		retaining that beauty enhanced by its 300 years of glorious history. 
		Words cannot describe it, just as words cannot truly tell of any beauty 
		in Japan. You must see it in order to know what I mean. Japan is 
		ancient. Up until a few years ago, and that is less than 90 years, Japan 
		was a feudal state, living just as it had for hundreds of years, with 
		lords (daimyos) and serfs. Shoguns (dictators) ruled for spaces of years 
		now and then just as in European feudal times. Nothing progressed save 
		art and literature and religion. Japan was isolated, and it was not 
		until the coming of Perry and the Majii Era that Japan suddenly 
		transformed itself into a great modern country. Here in Japan we are 
		studying the relics of a civilization thousands of years old, because 
		Japan has been the same for thousands of years. It is hard to believe. 
		Yesterday we saw a suit of armor made 80 years ago for a prominent 
		shogun, to be actually used in warfare. It was exactly the same as one 
		used centuries ago. So when we see these great Buddhist and Shinto 
		treasures, we are seeing perfectly preserved relics of a culture older 
		than the Roman language.<br><br>Now, to continue with Chion-in. After 
		climbing 50 steep steps beyond the massive gate, we receive our first 
		full view of the monastery and all its parts – a group of five great 
		buildings, weatherbeaten and unpainted like the gate, and just as 
		colossal in size. In the main room of the central structure is situated 
		Chion-in’s historical altar. Save the altar, the entire room is bare, 
		with straw mats covering the floor. To strike a comparison, there is 
		sample floor space for two full size basketball courts. On the altar 
		stands a completely furnished and decorated model temple of bronze and 
		damascene. Black robed priests chant over boxes of sacred literature, 
		while the head priest, in gorgeous white, gold bordered robe, offers 
		incense to Buddha and mutters sacred rituals. The rhythm of the chant is 
		occasionally broken by the ringing of bells and the clicking of wood 
		blocks. We stand entranced in the weirdness of the ceremony going on 
		before us. It was something one could watch all day, bewitched by the 
		mysticism of a Buddhist prayer passed down unchanging through the ages.<br>
		<br>After paying an entrance fee of 10 sen, we were taken into the 
		adjoining buildings of the monastery by a guide who was extremely happy 
		at the chance to practice and display his English. He showed us the 
		Imperial suite where the Emperor stays on visits to the temples, 
		beautifully simple with 300 years old, gold-leaf screens – in fact, so 
		old that it is now possible to see plainly the borders of the gold 
		patches as they were laid on. Elegant pine trees, morning glories, 
		phoenix and herons, painted on gold, cover many of the temple screens, 
		all national treasures. These trees and birds are symbols of good luck. 
		Evidently the Emperor does not place much faith in these luck bringing 
		objects, for he has a special room opening into his own suite, where 
		guards may stand watch behind damascene doors, ever ready to protect the 
		Mikado. At the time of our visit, one of the main structures was having 
		a new roof of cedar bark, pressed tightly together, a foot a d a half 
		thick, put on to replace the old, now beginning to leak after years of 
		service.<br><br>We pass out along the singing corridor, which is really 
		a squeaky floor, but which manipulated by the skillful feet of priests, 
		produces the singing of birds. We watch a black robed monk striking the 
		temple bell by means of a long pole suspended from the ceiling by ropes, 
		its weight giving it the needed momentum to sound the bell in deep, 
		doleful tones. The priest then points out to us a magnolia tree planted 
		by General Grant in the Temple garden, when he visited Japan many years 
		ago. Many interesting stories are told of General Grant’s visit. He is 
		very much admired by the Japanese people.<br><br>The temples are all 
		very interesting, but we next visited something, Mother, that you would 
		have gotten a great thrill out of, that is, a real, honest-to-goodness 
		Japanese garden. Even though we saw it at its worst, without blossoms or 
		flowers, it was beautiful. Stone lanterns, small torii, arched bridges, 
		scrawny Japanese pines twisted into truly artistic shapes by the 
		greatest artist of them all, Dame Nature, cherry and plumb trees, water 
		falls, and tea houses all played their part in creating such beauty. In 
		the central, large pond, 12 inch goldfish swam about and fed on a light 
		form of bread tossed in by an attendant. Tea and delicious cakes 
		completed our visit to Mr. Nomura’s garden, and we vowed then and there 
		to bring you here in the springtime as soon as possible, to enjoy Japan 
		before Western civilization tramples down its beauty in age and destroys 
		a culture uncontaminated through years of isolation.<br><br>Our next 
		object of adoration “The Kinkakuji” or “Gold Pavilion” lay on the 
		opposite side of the city; so it took some hard pedaling up along hills, 
		and at the same time dodging wild Japanese taxi drivers. And I mean they 
		are wild! It seems to me that they all close their eyes and blow their 
		horns, with their feet jammed down on the accelerators. The correct 
		Japanese way to stop a car is to wait until ten feet or so before the 
		intended stop, and then to jam on the brake, using up about 20 cents 
		worth of rubber each time. Riding in taxis is a sport like riding in a 
		stunting airplane.<br><br>Kinkakuji, whose proper name is Rokuonji, 
		belongs to the Zen sect of Buddhism. It was originally a pleasure house 
		of a leading Japanese, but at the end of the 14th Century, Ashikaga 
		Yoshimarteau, after abdicating the shogunate, retired to this place 
		where he became a Buddhist monk. Here he made a beautiful garden, in the 
		center of which is a picturesque pond, and on its bank he built Kinkaku 
		(the Gold Pavilion). The ceilings, railings, etc. were once embellished 
		with gold, but now very little remains.<br><br>In order to reach the 
		Pavilion, we had to pass through the adjoining temple. No one could 
		speak English so we were obliged to navigate by ourselves. The temple 
		was typically Buddhist with the usual gold hangings, screens, and lamps. 
		One object which interested us especially was a broken and weatherbeaten 
		model of the three famous monkeys “See no evil, hear no evil, speak no 
		evil.” They must have been centuries old.<br><br>After putting our shoes 
		back on, we wandered along winding paths through a garden as picturesque 
		as one could imagine a Japanese garden to be. Landscaping carried to 
		perfection, centered around the mirrorlike pond, irregular bordered, 
		with islands and trees arising in miniature from the water’s surface. In 
		the background, the “Gold Pavilion,” now brown with age, reflected its 
		three stories in nature’s mirror. Our only disappointment was that they 
		day was cloudy, and only after much maneuvering were we able to secure 
		photographs, which we hope will show the beauty which we can’t describe.<br>
		<br>The Pavilion is really very simple, at least from what we could see, 
		not being allowed to go above the first story. It is a pavilion, just as 
		the name implies, and just as we Americans would imagine it, spacious 
		rooms opening out onto long porches overlooking Kyoko-chi (mirror pond). 
		It is said that the ceiling of the third story is made entirely of one 
		piece of camphor wood and on the second floor, a statue of Kobo Diahi, 
		founder of the Shingon sect of Buddhism and really Buddhist itself, 
		reposes. A seated image of Buddha embellished in gold, is the main 
		object of interest on the first floor, surrounded by numerous smaller 
		figures unknown to us. Ted and I enjoyed seeing the Pavilion very much, 
		but we felt that the true beauty of Kinkakuji lay in its gardens. Pines, 
		firs, magnolias, and cedars grew in abundance, one of these pines being 
		fashioned into the shape of a Chinese junk by the skillful hands of 
		monks.<br><br>At the gate, as we strolled out of Kinkakuji, a strange 
		religious ceremony was going on. Seated around a fire made of green pine 
		boughs, and throwing on votive offerings, bundles of sticks tied in 
		paper and blessed by the head priest who tapped each with a knife in a 
		certain fashion, a number of priests, clothed in what seemed to us to be 
		sacking cloth, stamped with large ideographs, chanted and rang bells 
		(always at the wrong time, we thought, because any semblance of harmony 
		was always thrown off with the untimely ringings). Fruits and vegetables 
		rested on a plain, makeshift altar, evidently food for the god or gods 
		of the small red temple standing in the background. We would have been 
		content to stay and watch for hours, entranced by the strangeness of it 
		all, but there was more of Kyoto to be seen, and we would have to hurry 
		as night was not far off.<br><br>Down through the city again, woolen 
		watch caps pulled over our ears to keep out the nippy air, we pedaled 
		hurriedly in order to see the largest Buddhist and Shinto shrines in 
		Japan, situated in the city’s southern side.<br><br>Higashi-Hongani 
		Temple, the magnificent Buddhist temple, was erected in 1895 at a cost 
		of 7 million yen, about $2,000,000. It is colossal, prodigious, and 
		stupendous. It dwarfs any temple in Japan, save the Nishi-Honganji 
		Shinto Shrine situated behind it. The main temple and great building of 
		Higashi is made up of one great room. This room is beautiful in its 
		simplicity. Its spaciousness inspires one in one as he stands 
		contemplating the power and influence of the Buddhist religion. 
		Higashi’s tremendous size is a true symbol of the authority and 
		influence exercised by Buddhism in Japan. In the center of the immense 
		hall, the altar glimmered through shadows now deep as night approached. 
		The brilliant reflection of candle flame on brass and damascene was all 
		that could be seen. Believers padded in, shoeless, on mats, tossed coins 
		into the offering box, kneeled and bowed low, then padded out again. 
		This procession has been going on for years, day and night, and will 
		continue as long as Buddhism survives. It is a revelation to see with 
		what sincerity the Buddhist demonstrates his belief.<br><br>It was 
		almost dark, so we rode quickly over to the Nishi-Hongangi Shrine, 
		Shintoism’s symbol of power. Almost as big as the Buddhist temple, and 
		equally as impressive, Nishi Shrine appeared to be almost the exact 
		counterpart of its larger competitor. Unpainted, its pillars covered 
		with little scraps of paper on which are printed Japanese characters, 
		votive offerings to the gods, and with its steady flow of believers to 
		offer prayers, Nishi-Hongangi is truly as awe-inspiring as the Buddhist 
		shrine. Shintoism, however, is slowly losing ground as the imported 
		Buddhism from India by Koba Diashi, gradually gains power, just as 
		Japanese life is being revolutionized by imported Western civilization 
		nation. Buddhism is a beautiful and idealistic religion, and we hope 
		that this part of Japanese civilization will remain strong through this 
		period of change and confusion. It is strong enough to survive.<br><br>
		Darkness was now upon us, so we climbed on our bikes and rode off to our 
		hotel. Mr. Shimomura, owner and manager of Kyoto’s great department 
		store, was waiting for us, and after gathering our things together, we 
		drove off in his English touring car to spend the night in a real 
		Japanese inn.<br><br>Please stick around – I hope you can take it – some 
		more is coming.<br><br><br><br>Dick<br><br><br><br>Nara, Japan, February 
		17, 1936<br><br><br><br>Dear Mom, Dad, and Bruce:<br><br>We have enjoyed 
		our short stay in Kyoto very much. During the first day we saw the 
		Imperial Palace, but spent most of our time seeing the city life in the 
		streets. It is not easy to do justice to the sights we witnessed that 
		day in the old capital of Japan. Kyoto of one million population is more 
		a native city than Tokyo. Most of the streets are narrow and dirty. A 
		continuous procession of humanity flows through those streets. Bicycles 
		are the main means of transportation and are of commercial importance. 
		Men and women alike pull their goods along on a two-wheel affair. And 
		sometimes the horn of a car is heard above clatter of clogs on the dirt 
		and cement. Shops are everywhere intermingled with private residences 
		and inns. Brightly colored flags indicate by means of large ideographs 
		the necessary advertisement information of each open store. Fruit stands 
		are numerous. Japanese apples and oranges are arranged in a very 
		tempting manner. Also the bakeries are many. I had no desire for those 
		heavy starch cakes of many colors and was satisfied to pass on. One of 
		the rarer places is one fish market lane. Every kind of sea life and 
		being sold to housewives who carried their children on their backs and 
		usually had a few kiddies chasing behind. This district of Kyoto we 
		called the multi-stench district, because there was not one distinct 
		odor, but just as many as you would care to imagine. Everyone with the 
		exception of the children who are playing in the streets is businesslike 
		and serious as they go about their work. Only in the evening along the 
		movie avenue are the crowds gay. One evening we left the hotel and 
		walked to this so-called movie street. Japanese and American theaters 
		alike were situated along the brightly lighted avenue. These buildings 
		are of strictly modern architecture, a surprising fact to be noted. To 
		each side as we make our way along are brightly lighted shops; and 
		fakers, with a crowd around them, are telling of their wonderful 
		product. The only sound above the hum of voices is the clatter made by 
		the Japanese shoe of wood. Dick and I being so tall are at an advantage, 
		and we watch with ease the fascinating displays of cheap merchandise 
		over the heads of the smaller Japanese. Everything is tempting, but 
		luckily enough we have no money to spend; therefore we are safe.<br><br>
		I have tried to give you an idea of what we have seen in Kyoto. To us it 
		is just like one continuous theater, the players being the peasants and 
		natives. One must see it in order to fully appreciate the quaintness of 
		it all. As we were walking up one street, we saw two gentlemen walking 
		towards us. They had large baskets over their heads completely covering 
		their faces. In one hand they carried a stick. We later learned from Mr. 
		Shimomura that they were professional entertainers and that the clubs in 
		their hands were instruments of some sort.<br><br>Although everything 
		and everyone are very unique to us, we being foreigners of such height 
		are quite an unusual thing to the Japanese person. We virtually tower 
		over them, and as we walk along they stop and give us a very close 
		once-over, sometimes remarking to a friend with a giggle or muttering 
		something under the beard. We can take it though since we are proud of 
		our height.<br><br>We are getting quite used to driving and walking on 
		the left all the time. Since there are no speed cops in Japan, one may 
		travel as fast as desired. The taxis, of which there are thousands, 
		since it is cheaper to ride in a taxi all the time than own a private 
		car, are supreme on the street; and the bicycle must watch its step 
		every minute. Pedestrians of course must watch out for themselves.<br>
		<br>Many American architects have been brought to Japan and have 
		constructed some very beautiful buildings such as the Mitsui Bank 
		Building in Tokyo; and also there ha been much ultra-modern 
		construction. But there is that part of each city which is the real 
		primitive thing; and that is what Dick and I look for in a town. 
		Thatched roofs, adobe walls, and peasant scenes are what we have seen in 
		the poorer district. This is old Japan.<br><br>We wish we might go 
		further into the back country and get a better idea of what has been 
		going on for many centuries. But we must save that for another day which 
		we all must enjoy in a few years.<br><br>Boy, could I go for some home 
		cooking! A milkshake! Don’t mention it, it gets me. But as we say, we 
		can drink milkshakes the rest of our lives; but this is only one treat 
		in many.<br><br>Tell Elizabeth to start preparing a real home-coming

		a third structure, reduced to 66 percent of the old building, 160 feet 
		high with a frontage of 188 feet, and a depth of 166 feet, holds the 
		distinction of being the largest wooden structure in the world. A 
		feeling of awe came over me at seeing this huge Buddha, knowing that 
		there it had sat and had been worshiped for centuries. It seemed like a 
		living thing of the past. The Buddha itself had a dark gray color, and 
		the gold gilding behind made a halo around the head and shoulders. We 
		were very much impressed, and we had a funny feeling as we left, knowing 
		that long after we shall be gone, there it will sit as though waiting

		<br><br><br>On Board Hakone Maru, February 22, 1936<br><br><br><br>Dear 
		Mom, Dad, and Bruce:<br><br>As we are leaving Japan after a marvelous 
		two weeks of education and pleasure, I shall tell you of some of our 
		experiences during the last few days.<br><br>From various sources we 
		have heard of a mountain town called Joyaman, which consisted of 
		Buddhist monasteries in which we could stay overnight. In the spring and 
		summer time, it is a popular trip, but very few venture there in winter. 
		Anyway, we were enthused at the idea since we had read much about it in 
		a paper given to us by Dr. Burke and Dr. Rickley. Everything was 
		arranged, and we left Kobe one afternoon and took the train. The train 
		climbs the mountain party way, then a cable car goes the rest. The train 
		ride through those mountain towns and farms was fascinating, and 
		exceptionally so when it grew dusk and lights began to flicker, and 
		smoke began to curl from the farmhouse chimney tops. Although it was 
		late in the afternoon, people, men and women, were still in their fields 
		tilling the soil. The thatched roof houses, constructed of bamboo and 
		plastered with an adobe, were surrounded by rice and vegetable fields. I 
		could ride for hours among those scenes without tiring. Everything seems 
		so neat and quaint from the train as it winds up the mountain. The 
		farmers wear a blue dungaree sort of dress and always have a towel or 
		cloth tied over their heads for protection. All in all, I wanted to get 
		off the train and wander over the countryside in that peaceful, 
		harmonious atmosphere.<br><br>Early in the evening we reached the cable 
		car and boarded it for the top of the mountain. It became colder and 
		colder, and snow as abundant. A frozen waterfall was to one side, and we 
		muffled up more and more. From the top, we took a bus to the entrance to 
		the city proper. Rikishas awaited us, and we were hurried through the 
		snow, past brightly lighted shops and dimly illuminated temples to our 
		monastery gate. Everything was peacefully quiet as we waited for a monk 
		to open the oaken door, and when he finally came, we were ushered 
		through the halls to our Japanese room. Having left our shoes at the 
		front steps, and leaving our slippers at our room, through a sliding 
		screen door we entered and warmed ourselves over a charcoal brazier, the 
		only means of heating in the Japanese home. After a Japanese meal, to 
		our surprise, a young monk entered our room and spoke good English to 
		us. We talked for quite a while, and then walked into the town before 
		getting to bed.<br><br>In the morning we were awakened very early by our 
		friend who spoke English. The temperature was below zero, centigrade; 
		and we were mighty cool. We followed him down a hall and stopped in 
		front of a screen door. From within we could plainly hear the chanting 
		of men’s voices. He slid back the screen door, and we stepped into a 
		long room, which revealed itself to be the main temple. Behind the tall 
		candles which lined the front side of the shrine were golden lotus 
		plants. All the decoration was in gold lacquer and brass, and in the 
		middle, directly in front of the presiding, chief monk, was the altar on 
		which stood a statue of Buddha. In front of us as we seated ourselves in 
		the difficult Japanese style were the believers, pilgrims who had come 
		to give offering and receive blessing from the monks. Along the back of 
		the room, to either side of the chief monk, were the monks of the 
		monastery, chanting in the Shingon style. In a few minutes the chief 
		monk, at the sound of a gong, arose, bowed slightly as he approached the 
		altar, kneeled and bowed again three times in front of the shrine, each 
		time touching his head to the floor. As the chanting continued, he 
		offered incense to the Buddha into a sacred bronze bowl. Soon he arose 
		and signaled each believer to approach in his turn. To each he gave 
		blessing, and each bowed low in his turn. Finally at the sound of a 
		gong, the chief monk, together with the believers, left the chapel; but 
		the chanting continued. At the sound of another gong, the music stopped. 
		Each young and old monk took a string of beads called a rosary, out of 
		his kimono sleeve, rubbed it between his hands several times, then arose 
		and departed. The service was at an end.<br><br>We returned to our room, 
		and during our Japanese breakfast we were told of the history of 
		Koya-san. This mountain was discovered by Kobo Daishi, the founder of 
		the Buddhist religion in Japan. He wanted to find some spot where he 
		could settle and teach his belief. Presented by the Emperor with the 
		mountain, he with his followers constructed the temples of Koya-san, 
		most of which have bee destroyed by fire and the elements. It is the 
		belief that Kobo Daishi did not die, but merely entered.<br><br><br><br>
		On Board Hakone Maru, February 22, 1936<br><br><br><br>Dar Mom, Dad, and 
		Bruce:<br><br>Yesterday morning we left Kobe on the train for Meji, via 
		Miyajima. Until the day before, we had planned to take the day express 
		through the Island Sea; but on learning that a visa costing ten dollars 
		would be necessary for Shanghai, we change dour plans and started by 
		train. The train ride held many new and beautiful sights for us. Looking 
		out a train window in Japan is to us like watching a lovely drama. We 
		came in touch with more of the real, old Japan than ever before. Houses 
		and dress were more primitive, and the countryside was beautiful as 
		ever. Every now and then we would catch glimpses of the refreshing 
		Inland Sea and its quaint sailing vessels. It snowed for a while during 
		the morning, but by the time we reached Miyajima, everything was clear 
		blue. Perhaps you are wondering what Miyajima is and why we are 
		interested in it. You have heard of and have seen pictures of the “Torii 
		in the Water.” Well it is at this place that I speak of. We alighted 
		from the train and took the ferry to an island. But first let me tell 
		you a little of this place of interest. By some it is judged to be one 
		of “the three famous views” in Japan. Miyajima is an island in the 
		Inland Sea, 5 miles long and 2 1/2 miles wide. In every season of the 
		year it is beautiful. The hills and valleys run right down to the sea, 
		and fishing boats along the shore give a very romantic setting.<br><br>
		The main object of interest is a temple, which is so built that it looks 
		to float on the water. In front of the temple about one hundred yards 
		out in the water is the Torii (temple gate). It stands about 45 feet 
		high and is a weatherbeaten piece of history. It must have been a 
		beautiful thing in its day. And even now there is a majesty about it. 
		Tame deer are everywhere, giving a peaceful, quiet effect to the 
		landscape. On a small hill above the Torii is a five-storied pagoda 
		standing 100 feet in the air. There are many legends about Miyajima, 
		about three goddesses to whom it was dedicated thirteen hundred years 
		ago. Back in the hills are many parks, in which, they say, is real 
		beauty. We were sorry that time did not permit us to see everything.<br>
		<br>We enjoyed the town itself, which lies near the temple. It is 
		principally composed of curio shops, which were very enticing indeed. We 
		spent about two hours on the Island, and about sunset when the shadows 
		began to lengthen, we left on the ferry for the mainland. We had a 
		satisfied feeling within us, for we had seen a truly famous relic of 
		beauty.<br><br>Again boarding the train, we made the acquaintance of a 
		Japanese Army Officer, on his way to Manchukuo. He spoke very little 
		English, but due mostly to Dick’s patience, we had him fairly at ease as 
		we asked each other questions. We were speaking of military operations 
		of the world when he volunteered, “We do not want to fight America,” 
		which is truly the feeling in Japan, contrary to America’s fears. When 
		we left, he asked for our address and said he wanted to write us about 
		Manchukuo. We exchanged addresses and felt very happy in our 
		acquaintance.<br><br>When we reached Shimoneseki, across the way from 
		Moji, an N.Y.K. man met us and had a launch waiting to take us to our 
		ship, which was anchored in stream. Some style!<br><br>Dick and I plan 
		to jot down our impressions of Japan, although incomplete as they are 
		due to our short period of stay.<br><br>We have surely had a profitable 
		stay in Japan with the exception of the pecuniary angle. But we think we 
		know quite a bit, and only hope that the rest of the trip will be as 
		successful.<br><br>With much love,<br><br>Ted<br><br><br><br><br><br>Our 
		suits are great. We look slick in them. They are of good material and 
		light – just right for California, and our silk shirts are the cat’s

		Charley Frazer wrote a magazine article on his stay at our native inn at 
		Kyoto, and he got some beautiful photographs with his Leica. We plan to 
		get our contax in Hong Kong, and then will “go to town.” I hope you are 
		getting some good pictures with the movie and Recomar.<br><br>At the 
		Tokyo Rotary meeting, District Governor Asabuki of Japan introduced 
		himself to us. He said he was coming to the Conference in the U.S.A., 
		arriving on May 27 (I think) on the “Afama Maru” in San Francisco. It 
		would be fine if you could meet him and take him to Rotary the next day. 
		He expressed his wish to go to Oakland Rotary if possible. I think that 
		you had better check up on the date and boat. It is not entirely 
		necessary for you to meet him, but someone should. You might make 
		another fine Japanese friend.<br><br>I am enclosing Baroness Togo’s 
		card. She is going to write you, but perhaps you would like to write her 
		first, Mother. She will be a great friend when you come to Japan. There 
		is not much to tell about these last few days. Ted has told you about 
		Miyajima and Koya-san, the two high spots. Anyway, I will go briefly 
		over the events.<br><br>February 18. After spending most of the morning 
		writing letters, we climbed on the tram-car at Nara and rode for over an 
		hour to Osaka. Osaka is the manufacturing center of Japan. It is purely 
		a commercial city. It also stands out in my memory as the dirtiest of 
		Japan’s cities. There is very little to tell about it except to say that 
		its one place of historical interest is Osaka Castle. It was built in 
		1585 by Hikeyoshi, one of Japan’s great war heros.<br><br>At the train, 
		we were met by a representative of the Japan Tourist Bureau who took us 
		to another station where we boarded the electric train to Kobe, at which 
		place we arrived in twenty-five minutes and were met by an official of 
		N.Y.K. at Mr. Nakase’s instance, Mr. Ishiguro, Assistant Passenger 
		Agent. After taking us to lunch at th Oriental Hotel, he helped us get 
		our tickets for Koya-san, and we left, on our journey up the mountain. 
		Ted has told you about this, thank goodness. My arm is giving out. (No, 
		this is not a handout.) On arriving back in Kobe at 2 p.m. the next day, 
		February 19, we immediately went to the Hakone at dock, cleaned up, put 
		our new suits on, just arrived from Tokyo, and went for an N.Y.K. drive 
		along the beachfront. Sukyabi is Kobe’s finest restaurant, and we 
		enjoyed it as much as usual. After dinner, a walk own Kobe’s main 
		street, on which no cars or bicycles are allowed, and then to bed on 
		shipboard.<br><br>Kobe is the port for Osaka’s manufactured articles. It 
		is a real shipping city, very much like Yokohama. The buildings are old, 
		and much of old Japan still remains within a few minutes’ walk of the 
		city’s center.<br><br>February 20. Made arrangements for our railroad 
		journey to Moji via Miyajima, where we would pick up the Hakone on the 
		21st. At Rotary lunch at the Oriental Hotel, Ted and I sat at the 
		Chairman’s side, and I said a few words about our impressions of Japan. 
		The Club is entirely Japanese, about seventy of them. Does not compare 
		with Tokyo. They don’t come much better than there. Mr. Yussa sat next 
		to me and was very kind, inviting us to stay at his home on our next 
		trip to Kobe. He has the real spirit.<br><br>After lunch, N.Y.K. took us 
		out to Takarazuka, headquarters of the Girls’ Opera, and about forty 
		minutes tram-car ride from Kobe. There we enjoyed a beautiful 
		presentation by the girls, the same girls who gave the opera in Tokyo.<br>
		<br>We had gotten in touch that afternoon with Mrs. Barrington Foote, 
		who told us she was staying in a lovely English boarding house, and we 
		could have two meals and room for 11 yen. Of course, we jumped at it and 
		enjoyed two real home-cooked meals, soft beds, and conversation with 
		Mrs. Foote and the charming English, French, and American boarders. The 
		Americans were real people in Kentucky. They will call you when in San 
		Francisco, but they cannot stop over. They are aching to get home.<br>
		<br>Kobe’s hotels are terrible, and Mrs. Foote had almost gone crazy 
		until she found this place. Believe me, we will stay there when in Kobe 
		– much cheaper and nicer than hotels. I will send you the address so 
		that we can tell our friends. It will be a real help to them.<br><br>
		This letter has been one complete mess, and I hope you have been able to 
		make some sense out of it. You should be getting our letters fairly 
		regularly now. We will number them now so you can tell if you get them 
		all. (1) has already gone.<br><br>Well, I hope this letter will do. Our 
		next will tell of China and Shanghai. We think constantly of you and 
		would sure like to have Bruce along in side car as he suggests. However, 
		his day will come, we know.<br><br>Lots of love,<br><br>Dick<br><br>
		--------------------<br><br>February 23, 1936<br><br>A NIGHT IN A 
		JAPANESE INN<br><br>Since we had asked to spend the night in a real 
		native inn, Mr. Shimomura took us to the finest one in Kyoto, naturally, 
		because we were a leading Rotarian’s son and would demand the best, 
		especially of such an inn owned by a Rotarian. A special rate of 19 yen 
		for a room and dinner and breakfast for two was made. You can see our 
		position, being entertained by wealthy Rotarians who naturally think we 
		should have the best, and pay for it, especially if the establishment is 
		Rotary owned. You see, in Japan, the finest of everything is owned or 
		managed by Rotarians, and Hiragiya, our native hotel, was no exception.<br>
		<br>At the entrance, we were met by a group of smiling girls, in kimono 
		and ebi, who chattered welcome to us in their native tongue. Although we 
		understood few of their words, they smiles and giggles carried to us 
		what their tongues did not.<br><br>After removing our shoes and donning 
		slippers in customary Japanese style, although our feet were slightly 
		large in comparison to the slippers made for small Nipponese feet, we 
		padded along behind our feminine guide, who was to be our private 
		servant, to our room for the night. Major Overton would have felt right 
		at home in such a place, not a speck of dirt anywhere. Highly polished 
		floors, neat paper screens, and spotless mats. Coming into our rooms 
		(there were two of them), Ted and I committed our first major blunder. 
		We wore our slippers into the room and on the clean mats. Muttering 
		apologies and trying vainly to hide our embarrassment, we hurried to the 
		door and slipped our footgear off. One never wears anything but socks on 
		mats in a Japanese house. Our two rooms were plain, but beautiful in 
		their simplicity. Sliding, gold lacquered screens separated the two 
		rooms. For pictures, large ideographs on smooth mounted Japanese paper 
		were placed in several places around the screens. More writing of 
		Admiral Togo. It seems to Ted and me that the great Japanese here must 
		have spent most of his time writing such characters, taking a half hour 
		off to lead his Japanese fleet against the Russians. For heat, the 
		ancient Japanese warming plant, charcoal, had to fill the bill. The day 
		was cold and foggy, and braziers had been placed in each room. Our rooms 
		opened on to glass encased verandas overlooking a tiny Japanese garden, 
		which we could not fully appreciate because of the darkness and lack of 
		springtime blossoms. We could not imagine any hotel more comfy or more 
		picturesque than this.<br><br>Kneeling on silken pillows around the low 
		Japanese table, we were served unsweetened Japanese tea in dainty 
		porcelain cups with wooden saucers. Although Ted and I can’t say that we 
		crave this beverage, it is refreshing and does quench the thirst. It is 
		an institution in Japanese life. After tea, Mr. Shimomura bade us 
		goodnight, leaving us at the mercy of our smiling Japanese guardian, who 
		was to show us the why and wherefore of everything.<br><br>Would we like 
		sukiyaki for dinner? We replied with an enthusiastic “Yes.” “Chicken or 
		beef?” “Beef.” We knelt on our cushion, frequently changing positions as 
		our muscles became cramped, while Tanaka (our girlfriend’s name) made 
		ready for a dinner of our favorite Japanese dish. It seems to me that 
		“sukiyaki” grows on one. The more you eat, the more you want. In the 
		center of our spacious dinner table, she heats the “nabe” or cooking pan 
		over the usual charcoal fire, which gives off a surprising amount of 
		heat. Animal fat is used to grease the pan, then “Shoyu,” a basic 
		oriental sauce, is poured in to season our dish. From a dish beside her, 
		Tanaka takes thin slices of beef, leeks, onions, konnayaku (a think 
		spaghetti-like gelatine vegetable), and tofu, a highly important 
		Japanese bean curd, indispensable in soups. She places these 
		constituents in the steaming nabe, and delicious odors fill our 
		nostrils. We did not realize how famished we were until now. As soon as 
		the meat and vegetables are cooked, we pick them out with our “hashi” 
		(chopsticks). But they are too hot for our mouths, so we dip them in a 
		beaten raw egg sitting before us in china cups. Tanaka keeps our nabe 
		full of good things all of the time as we consume great quantities of 
		this savory dish, helped along by several servings of the indispensable 
		Japanese rice. Boy, what a meal! America has no dish to compare with 
		this. If they serve sukiyaki at that San Francisco Japanese restaurant, 
		you should try it now.<br><br>To top off this delicious meal, Japanese 
		soy bean soup and Japanese cucumber and cabbage are served, ending with 
		fruit, luscious mandarin oranges and red apples. Ted and I then sit 
		back, stuffed to the top, and contemplate on the beauties of life and 
		especially sukiyaki!<br><br>Tanaka then removed the portable kitchen, 
		and left us to our own devices. After writing some letters, we slippered 
		to the door (some use of the English language?) and shoed down the 
		street (some more English) get our last glimpse of the brightly lighted 
		Kyoto theater street, and to enjoy the shop windows and excitement in 
		the air.<br><br>At nine o’clock our Japanese bath would be ready, so we 
		returned early to prepare for our next adventure. We had heard so much 
		about the Japanese institution of bathing and were anxious to see how it 
		conformed to our ideas. In the theaters, one can rent a bath and spend 
		his time there between shows. Tanaka informed us that our bath was 
		ready, and told us to follow her to the room. We had heard much about 
		bath girls who scrubbed your back for you, and were greatly relieved 
		when placed in the hands of a male attendant who showed us our haven of 
		rest and enjoyment, a square tiled room in the center of which stood a 
		similarly square wooden bathtub, filled with steaming hot water. We 
		hurriedly slipped off our clothes in the adjoining dressing room, and 
		raced in, each trying to get there first. With a great splash, we piled 
		in (of course we would both bathe at once), but we were out again in 
		less time than it takes to say Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address. (It takes 
		us an awful long time because we don’t know it.) That water was hot, but 
		by means of an immersion by stages, we managed to at least sit on the 
		bottom, our heads only above water. What a life! Dad ought to try it 
		sometime – complete mental and physical relaxation, without having to 
		dangle abnormally long legs over the end of the tub. As we became used 
		to the water, more hot water was added. It’s lucky Dad wasn’t there with 
		a thermometer – it would have broken with the temperature. It was with 
		great heroic sacrifice that we climbed out, soaped ourselves and dropped 
		back in. In fact, we felt that if we didn’t get out soon, our muscles 
		would turn to gelatine with heat and relaxation, and we would never get 
		out. So out we climbed agin, ran a light towel over our bodies, climbed 
		into our kimonos and padded to our room. They say that after taking a 
		Japanese bath, your body is so warm that you need never be afraid of 
		chilling by cold air, and most Japanese do not dry themselves, but 
		merely wrap up in their kimonos, the heat of their bodies drying 
		themselves.<br><br>On returning to our rooms, we found our beds already 
		made up and waiting for us, inviting us to climb in between thick, soft, 
		warm comforters, brightly colored in Japanese style. Each comforter was 
		really a large kimono with places for the arms. The bed, naturally, was 
		laid on the floor in true Japanese style. Our mattresses were three 
		heavy silken mats laid one above the other. For a pillow, the mattress 
		was merely raised by a small mat placed underneath. With no effort on 
		our part, we were soon off in the land of dreams – dreams as strange and 
		charming as our native inn.<br><br>Early in the morning we arose from 
		our comfortable bed. There was much to do, for we must soon be off for 
		Nara and more of old Japan. We brushed our teeth with Japanese 
		toothbrushes and toothpaste (Lion tooth powder), provided by every 
		native hotel. Tanaka then announced breakfast; so, squatting in our 
		kimonos, we enjoyed an appetizing repast of Japanese soup, vegetables, 
		eggs and fruit. Then, after packing our things, we left our fairyland in 
		Mr. Shimomura’s car to hurry to the station, and as we put our shoes on 
		and climbed into the waiting car, all of our Inn friends, Tanaka 
		especially, cried cheery “Sayonaras” and wished us good lunch on our 
		journey. This was true Japanese hospitality, which is found only in the 
		inns of old Japan, and it was with much regret that we had to leave. Ted 
		and I will always remember those happy faces and our visit at Hiragiya 
		Inn.<br><br>Your loving son and brother,<br><br>Dick<br><br><br>Hakone

		cabin with one foot in the waste basket. The wastebasket as you know is 
		a very convenient thing to have handy when you are trying to put 
		together a letter. Monday morning at day-break we steamed up the Whang 
		Po River. For a hundred miles at sea the water had been a brackish brown 
		from the mud brought down by the Yangtse Kiang. Dick and I were excited 
		and after a quick breakfast got out on deck in time to see one of the 
		first junks pass on its way downstream. It was an interesting craft, 
		very seaworthy looking and very dirty. The sails were real veterans, 
		black with age and filth, and patched at every seam. The unclean 
		meagerly dressed people on the deck looked up at us blankly for a 
		moment, then continued their business of sailing to the sea. As we 
		neared the landing we saw sampans being sculled with one oar by a 
		coolie, and marveled at his proficiency. On the deck stood more coolies, 
		all poorly clad in ragged acquired here and there.<br><br>We were met at 
		the boat by Rotarian and Assistant Commercial Attache, Bland Calder, 
		whom we liked immediately. With him came an apology for not meeting us 
		on the boat and an invitation to luncheon with Mr. Fong Sec. As we drove 
		the mile or so up to the Bund we eager;ly watched the people and their 
		actions. The first thing we noticed were the rickshaws drawn by coolies, 
		being controlled in the congested traffic by the large framed Sikhs, 
		policemen imported from India by the British. More rickshaws than we had 
		ever seen were everywhere around us, and Mr. Calder’s Packard was in 
		direct contrast to these one-man vehicles. Soon we approached the Bund. 
		Boats of all kinds and sizes lined the waterfront. And coming from the 
		larger vessels were the coolies in twos carrying heavy loads between 
		them strung from a thick bamboo pole by a rope. The thing that called 
		our attention to them was their chanting as they struggled under the 
		weights. One coolie would call to the other in a tenor voice and the 
		other would answer in in the same way but in a different note and this 
		would continue until their work was done. The philosophy must be that 
		the rhythm of the song aids in easing the weight in some way. We 
		listened to them and watched them for a long time.<br><br>From the river 
		we took rickshas to the old Chinese quarter where we alighted and 
		started down a rather dark street. Without our experienced escort we 
		might have felt differently but as it was we started boldly into 
		Chinatown. Shops of many kinds lined the narrow poorly paved streets. 
		Sunlight was scarce and everything had an unhealthy appearance. Slant 
		eyed individuals were all around us and a beggar stepped out in front of 
		us with arms outstretched. We had to brush by him quickly and move on. 
		In every shop was the owner and family and relatives he must support, 
		sitting round and looking important. Here and there were open-air 
		restaurants where one might watch filthy food cooked to sterilization.<br>
		<br>Soon we approached the bird market. Bird cages hung everywhere, 
		giving forth a furor of song. At length we were led by a man who 
		insisted on being our guide to see one of the old Mandarin gardens. 
		Artificial stones filled the landscape. A teahouse stood among some 
		palms and bamboo, and above it silhouetted in the sky were the fantastic 
		sweeping roofs of the ancient town. In the springtime this place is 
		frequented by people who enjoy having tea in the warm afternoon. Later 
		we entered a temple, or joss house, as it is called. Everything was dark 
		and filthy in full view of the candle-illuminated image of a God. Gold 
		trimming on materials framed the shrine, and in front stood the offering 
		box. Incense fumes were heavy, and people grouped around watching these 
		tall intruders. We hurried out to catch a breath of fresh air, retracing 
		our steps back to those ivory and silver shops and past the curio stores 
		at the entrance.<br><br>One look at the modern traffic convinced us that 
		we had just come from another world. Our next test of Chinese art was 
		Chinese chow. As the guest of Mr. Fong Sec we entered one of the better 
		modern restaurants. There we sat down to one of the most delicious meals 
		we have ever tasted. That Chinese restaurant had cooking down to a 
		science, and everything was surprisingly clean. After some soup, tea, 
		and dried watermelon seeds, the fun began. Platters of delicious food 
		were brought in at intervals and with our chopsticks we helped ourselves 
		to each plate in turn , mixing the assortment in rice and sauce. One 
		platter contained small shrimps in an omelet. Another was filled with 
		bird nest soup, and pigeon eggs were cooking in it. There was fried rice 
		with meat chopped up fine. And noodles were cooked in the Chinese style, 
		all of this variety before we were served a whole fish simmering in a 
		reddish brown sauce that only a Chinese chef could make. Within a few 
		minutes the naked skeleton of that once proud animal was staring us in 
		the face. We were sorry to see such food diapering so fast but nothing 
		could be done about it. And we will never forget it.<br><br>After the 
		meal while Mr.Fong Sec, Mr. Calder, Dick and I were trying to 
		recuperate, we talked over the Japanese-Chinese situation, and were 
		given the Chinese viewpoint, the direct opposite of that of the 
		Japanese. It was awfully discouraging to hear talk of Japan in a mode of 
		world conquest and the annihilation of China, but there was no doubt 
		that that is the way the Chinese feel.<br><br>After lunch, Mr. Fong 
		drove us to the new Civic Center of Shanghai. It seems that the present 
		location and layout is poor and is therefore a great handicap to the 
		city. So the government is attempting to build the city at another site. 
		Several buildings with their beautiful roofs represent the foundations 
		of a program to last several years.<br><br>On the way back we passed a 
		big stadium where a sort of national Olympic Games is held annually. 
		Along the highway are grave mounds, monuments to the dead, that are said 
		to occupy three percent of the nation’s land. Here and there were ruins 
		of buildings recently destroyed by the Japanese.<br><br>We came back 
		into the city proper and went directly to the YMCA, a big building 
		opposite the racetrack on Nanking Road, the main shopping street. It is 
		a beautiful place fitted with excellent athletic and social facilities. 
		After meeting the manager, a past president of Shanghai Rotary, Mr. 
		Fitch. we had tea in the lounge. Mr. Fong mentioned the “Charge to New 
		Members” and to our surprise, Mr. Fitch volunteered that he knew it by 
		heart, having said it many times in his presidency. i showed him my copy 
		and he recognized it immediately.<br><br>As it was getting late we 
		ascended to the roof of the building to see the lights of Shanghai and 
		then drove to Mr.Calder’s home. After meeting his wife and young son, we 
		inspected his house and found it to equipped with every modern 
		convenience, contrary to the belief that life is a hardship in Shanghai. 
		A visit to the country club was suggested and we quickly took that up. 
		it as turned to be an excellent club with fine facilities for golf, 
		tennis, swimming, bowling, ping pong, billiards and dancing. We were 
		ready to camp there but when we mentioned our desire to get in touch 
		with Mrs. Conrad, they told us they were the closest of friends, so we 
		drove to the Conrad house and met the Mr. and Mrs. and the young 
		daughter. We enjoyed them an Mrs. Conrad wished to know all about you, 
		mom and sends you her best. With her and Mr. Calder we then went out for 
		another fine meal together, the Calders having just returned from a trip 
		around the world. They gave us good information on what to see in 
		Europe, and the conversation was lively.<br><br>At dinner it was decided 
		to give us a taste of the night-life of Shanghai. We went to one cabaret 
		and didn’t like it. S And then entered another called the St. George run 
		by an ex marine. We sat down at a table and ordered refreshments and 
		watched the dancers. Girls were seated in chairs around the floor and we 
		learned that for thirty cents Chinese, or ten cents American, one might 
		dance with the girl he chooses. “Ten Cent a Dance” was real. One section 
		of chairs was assigned to White Russian girls, another for Eurasians, 
		and still another for Koreans. Dick and I each bought three tickets and 
		found each group to be great dancers and also very pretty. A Eurasian 
		Dick danced with turned out to have quite a personality. We also danced 
		with Mrs. Calder and Mrs. Conrad, and at no charge.<br><br>That evening 
		e stayed on board ship and the next morning after breakfast walked to 
		the NYK office on the Bund. The assistant passenger agent offered to 
		accompany us about Shanghai until sailing time. His name was O’Brien and 
		had lived in all but three countries in the world. He was a most 
		interesting person and at lunch we were given his opinion of the 
		political situation.<br><br>It had been snowing all morning so in the 
		afternoon we walked down the white street. A small boy poorly dressed 
		held out his hand as I passed. Into his palm I dropped a piece of candy. 
		No sooner had that been done than a flood of urchins engulfed us, 
		complaining in the only English they knew, taught them by the sailors. 
		“No Momma, no Papa, no whiskey soda”. It was a sorry scene but a very 
		common one. We needed light clothing for the hot weather ahead, so made 
		a purchase from a street side tailor. You must never pay the asking 
		price here so after 20 minutes of bartering we walked out of his store 
		and were halfway down the block before he finally came down to our 
		price, although it was probably his all along. Dad would have enjoyed 
		that encounter.<br><br>From the American Express we received our second 
		letter from home and avidly read it. We hope to find more waiting for us 
		in Hong Kong . With business finished we took the bus to the wharf and 
		our ship. We said goodbye to our friends and thanked them for their 
		wonderful hospitality, and in the rain steamed away from Shanghai down 
		the Whang Poo River to the sea.<br><br>Just a few observations: Lunch is 
		called “tiffen” here in the orient by foreign residents. Tea is served 
		around 5 o’clock and dinner at eight. At 9;15 the city’s entertainment 
		industry starts and lasts well into the wee small hours of the morning. 
		Those who don’t have to work sleep late until noon. Everyone takes life 
		easy and enjoys himself as much as possible<br><br>I’m pretty sure we 
		won’t land at Naples since NYK doesn’t make that stop. Therefore 
		Marseilles is the likely place to start our trip. We will have any mail 
		forwarded to Marseilles, and the deadline there will be April 12. After 
		that for three weeks it will be Geneva, Switzerland, and wherever. 
		Everything is ship-shape..D<br><br><br>March 1 Empress of Japan<br><br>
		<br><br>In past letters you have heard how our hands froze as we tried 
		to write. From now on the letters will be stained with sweat from our 
		brows as we labor in the tropics. Last night we left Hong Kong a 8 PM. 
		Our ocean caravan this time is the real thing, the Empress of Japan, 
		latest and the finest on the Pacific. Our second class accommodations 
		are better than the Hakone’s first. And the food-what variety and 
		quality! We have to waddle out of each meal. There is only a slight roll 
		and no pitching of the ship. This is the real way to travel. Tomorrow 
		will bring real heat, and Manila.<br><br>About the letters we are 
		supposed to have received pertaining to our stay in the Philippines. we 
		have seen neither hide nor hair. I hope it was not that important. We 
		did not find anything in Hong Kong and hope for something in Manila.<br>
		<br>From Shanghai to Hong Kong was an uneventful jaunt. The NYK people 
		again put us in first class cabins, and we enjoyed “second-class: food, 
		though “first-class” in quality. Our time was taken up, writing and 
		playing a little deck golf. As Ted told you, we purchased two dozen 
		handerkerchiefs and will send them out to friends in small batches. 
		These handkerchiefs are so beautiful and so heap that on our return to 
		Hong Kong we’ll get a number and bring them home to you. We feel any 
		money spent this way is a way ahead in value and worth the splurge.<br>
		<br>Ted and I went to bed on Thursday night, doing most of our packing 
		in anticipation of the next day. The night air was warm and after 
		opening our two ports, we endeavored to get some rest. However, we spent 
		the usual restless night that we experience the night before a new port. 
		At 6:30 AM we were up and hurriedly packing suitcases for we could see 
		that we were sailing through a wide channel, its shores lined with three 
		storied white buildings that we have seen in so many pictures-the port 
		of Hong Kong. The ship was not to dock until 8, and we seemed to have 
		plenty of time to pack. Hardly started, though, we were interrupted by 
		our room boy who informed us that passport examination was then being 
		held in the smoking room. Passports examined without red tape, we 
		finished packing as the ship slid into one of the docks, sticking like a 
		finger into the bay. We certainly did justice to our last breakfast on 
		the Hakone for we needed strength for a busy day.<br><br>Mr. Kinsey, 
		assistant manager of NYK was waiting for us on our return to the cabin. 
		We were immediately on the best of terms for he is a Californian from 
		Long beach and would be able to show us things Americans enjoy most. He 
		was a typical happy-go-lucky port representative that we find here in 
		the Orient, so often an American. He took full charge of our baggage, 
		arranged for our cabin on the Empress docked a few feet away, and we 
		were off to see the city, at the same time making important purchases, 
		the most important to date being the Contax camera.<br><br>I will not 
		say much about the city now or first impressions but save them for our 
		return visit when we know more. However I will tell you of the price, 
		merits, and virtues of our purchase. Our camera is an f 2 Sonnar Contax 
		with shutter speeds to 1/1000 of a second and to 1/2 a second. Its price 
		complete with case was $400, or $133 American. This camera sells for 
		$270 in America. Incidentally there is only one faster lens made and we 
		have more than enough speed at our command.<br><br>The Leica was $15 
		cheaper in our money but we chose the Contax for several reasons. Zeiss 
		Ikon, maker of the Contax, is the top of the line. The Contax has a 
		focal plane shutter of metal and not of cloth as used with the Leica, 
		for heat in the tropics can be a problem. The loading mechanism of the 
		Contax is much simpler and convenient. Focusing is also easier, and we 
		feel it is a sturdier camera to stand the rigors of weather and bike 
		riding.<br><br>The disadvantage is that it is a little more bulky. We 
		felt its advantages warranted the few extra dollars, so important to us. 
		Aside from bicycles this is our last large purchase. I will write soon 
		as to finances and how we are doing. We’ll now have some real pictures 
		for you and for the years to come. I will take a colored roll for you to 
		project on the screen<br><br>Our day in Hong Kong was spent buying tooth 
		brushes, film, slippers (6 cents a pair) and enjoying the sights in a 
		clean well managed city, at least the case in the foreign quarter. The 
		day was overcast and a few drops of rain came down but the air was warm 
		and we dispensed with coats and hats. We thought that in this way we 
		would look more like residents, but everywhere people took us for 
		tourists and we had the usual trouble of shooing away the beggars. It 
		seems that going around without a hat or coat is typical of the tourist. 
		We’ll learn, I hope. Our 35 cent lunch at Jimmie’s was just enough to 
		whet our appetites which we finally satisfied at dinner on the ship.<br>
		<br>This weather is getting to me. Any vivid descriptions will be badly 
		soiled by the heat. The letter will be worthy for facts not literary 
		value.<br><br>The ship was to sail at 5 Pm we were told, but after 
		standing on the deck watching junks alongside unload their cargoes, Ted 
		and I became convinced something was amiss. And so off to the purser’s 
		office where the sign said, “Sailing time 8 PM”. So off we jogged to 
		look along the wharves and streets of Kowloon until 7;15, dinner time. 
		We walked through clean modern wide streets for a mile or so and then 
		into dirty narrow alleys of the Chinese quarter, filled with squalid 
		children playing strange games. A beggar insisted on following us and it 
		wasn't until I gave him several harsh “Get aways.” that he let us alone. 
		On the main street we walked under a great tree filled with singing 
		birds, their music heard a block away.<br><br>Darkness had fallen by the 
		time we retuned to the ship and we hurriedly cleaned up for dinner. As 
		we finished eating, the Empress steamed slowly out of the harbor and 
		when we came out on the deck to enjoy the evening air, Hong Kong’s 
		lights were far behind and all was totally dark. We hit the hay and 
		slept like rocks.<br><br>This morning we again ran our waiter ragged but 
		he seemed to enjoy the large meal with us, and we could hear him 
		commenting to the other boy, who laughed with him. Our dining room is 
		spacious and very few chairs are filled so we felt it our duty to clean 
		up any food left around in the kitchen.<br><br>As I sit here, four of 
		the strangest people are playing hearts near us. One large man, visibly 
		worn by the heat, one chubby red faced lady who has a word for 
		everything; one thin sprightly elderly woman who must have been a hot 
		momma at one time-a typical bunch of tourists, but I guess to them we 
		looked just as odd.<br><br>The sun is really beating down now and the 
		sea one swell after another. Oh, to take a dip. This is just like 
		Hawaii. We sure wish you could be here to enjoy this tropical weather. 
		I've my Contax beside me, always on the look out for a fine shot. All of 
		the officers are now dressed in white, so I guess we had better break 
		out our newly acquired summer duds. This letter is the world’s greatest 
		mess but this weather does something to you. I guess it is just the 
		change for us. Will scribble again tomorrow.T<br><br><br>March 2 Manila<br>
		<br><br><br>It was great to receive your letters from Oakland via the 
		China Clipper. Thursday afternoon we watched her land in the bay, and 
		got a few shots. White skirted men and women lined the waters edge for a 
		long distance watching the giant airship, and of course sweating 
		profusely under the scorching rays of the sun. We love it. Here you have 
		the weather LA talks about and the year around. Everyone wears white all 
		of the time for there isn’t any winter. We can hardy believe our 
		eyes-flimsy houses, fully open without windows, just shades, just as in 
		the country clubs too. To us this is just one big year around resort.<br>
		<br>Our ship, the Empress, finally after a lot of maneuvering tied up at 
		the dock giving time to the customs officials to get their jobs done. Of 
		course we had on our new white duck suits, trying vainly to look cool. 
		White clothes here are made from everything from tissue paper to Saigon 
		linen.<br><br>Manila harbor is very much like the docking facilities in 
		other cities. However, it does lay claim to fame because it possesses 
		the largest dock in the world, dwarfing the Empress when tied up 
		alongside, and the Empress is a mighty big ship.<br><br>We were waiting 
		around for someone to give us the keys to the city when two girls walked 
		up to us. One was small, thin, and bespectacled, the other medium sized 
		and tending toward chubbiness. They introduced themselves as Bessie and 
		Mary Hackett, coming to take us in tow. So off we went. After a good 
		deal of bickering managed to get our suitcase out of hock, piled into a 
		taxi-all four with cases requiring a squeeze-and rolled off to the 
		European-American YMCA.<br><br>Manila was very mush as we expected. It 
		is a typical tropical city. Everyone dresses in white, top to bottom, 
		and laundry bills must be something. That’s the thing we don’t like 
		about Manila. It seems silly to us, for everyone wears coats and ties 
		all of the time in this heat. The comfortable attire would be shorts and 
		a polo shirt.<br><br>Of course I admit that some of Manila’s imported 
		robust business executives would not present a pleasing sight, but we 
		boys demand our comfort.<br><br>Policemen direct traffic under umbrellas 
		in intersection stands The traffic is made up of fast moving Austin 
		taxis and their larger standard brothers from America. And there are 
		horse-drawn carriages known as “Caratellas” which serve the native 
		population as cheaper taxis. They look a lot cooler and comfortable than 
		the overgrown motor driven carriages we civilized folk use, and there 
		ride costs about 10 cents. The natives her just like the folks at home 
		from the Philippines for they dress in all of the colors of the rainbow 
		This seems to mean light pants with cuffs covering the entire foot, dark 
		shirts and contrasting ties, usually white, and natty tie-pins and side 
		burns. They really put on the dog and pay fabulous prices for their 
		trappings.<br><br>This is a land of wealth and sunshine. A very few have 
		the wealth and all have the sunshine. As I sit here I look out through 
		the open screen and see a beautiful hibiscus with brilliant red flowers. 
		Across the street several native girls with long dresses and shawls 
		covering their heads are walking slowly by. What a contrast to Japan in 
		winter. It seems to me that the Japanese paper screened house would be 
		ideal for this climate. A cool breeze has made things more livable and 
		hopefully it will keep up.<br><br>Yesterday was spent in walking through 
		the downtown section, talking with the Hackett friends and eating two 
		small meals at the grills’ boarding house and with ice tea galore. In 
		the afternoon we drove out about three miles to the Polo Club and there 
		enjoyed a fast polo match along with a bottle of root beer and a 
		gorgeous sunset. The Polo Club is the meeting place for Americans. 
		Everyone takes tea on the beautiful lawn with colored lanterns above. On 
		Sunday evening dancing is in order from five to eight. The dancing 
		between sips is down in a large pavilion. The clubhouse with thatched 
		roof and sliding screens is just one big country club for the wives. 
		However, I don’t think we could enjoy it for long. Two weeks would do 
		it.<br><br>Ted and I wee shocked to hear about Stanford’s bad luck in 
		basketball. We don’t understand it. We hope they have pulled through by 
		now and will look forward to wearing bout the games in Hong Kong.<br>
		<br>Well, I’ll have to sign off now. This letter is going out on the 
		Clipper so Bruce can get the stamps. I’m afraid the weather does not 
		encourage literary inspiration. Hope you get something out of it. Ted 
		and I realize that from the time it has taken to write letters this far, 
		we will not be able to keep up the pace. I hope shorter letters will do. 
		I think we will have to keep our impressions more general-sort of survey 
		at best.<br><br>PS Mr. Lockwood came by this morning and will direct our 
		stay here. He was swell. We haven’t yet decided what we will ask of 
		Rotary D<br><br><br>March 14-15 Suwa Maru<br><br><br><br>I am now 
		sitting and writing in the lounge of the Suwa Maru, a half a day out of 
		Hong Kong. Ted is around somewhere also writing, and across the room who 
		do you suppose is reclining on the davenport but Paulette Goddard with 
		Charlie Chaplin next to her. She looks charming and he worn. I’ll bet 
		they are regular fellars. Perhaps we will make their acquaintances.<br>
		<br>We were thrilled to find your letters waiting for us on our return 
		from Canton. By the time this letter arrives I hope Bruce’s team has 
		cleaned up in the tournament and Stanford has landed on top. We enjoy 
		scanning the clippings you send. Hank seems to be coming up to 
		expectations and Howie is right there too. We received your books in 
		good order, including Mr. Shield’s. We should get good material out of 
		them. The Tuckers sent the candy to the boat. We’re writing Mrs. Gause, 
		among 1000 others. We hope everyone received the handkerchiefs.<br><br>
		Our last few days’ stay in Hong Kong and Canton were delightfully filled 
		with new experiences. Hong Kong has a population of 850,000 an is 
		situated along the northern shore on five miles of Hong Kong Island. The 
		city’s true name is Victoria, but is known as Hong Kong to American 
		geography students. The city fronts on a beautiful bay surrounded by 
		scenic beauty. Victoria Peak rises some 1800 feet behind the city and 
		one’s social rank is determined by the height at which one lives. The 
		Governor lives on the very top and joys a 10 degree lower temperature on 
		the sweltering days in the city. However, there is a price because the 
		he is wrapped in fog that did not leave during our stay. The city itself 
		is much like that seen in Compton’s Encyclopedia. Along the waterfront 
		you may see the strange pillared buildings rising tier upon tier and 
		almost the same in appearance. Sidewalks are protected from the flooding 
		downpours of rain by this tier-like arrangement. It is the strangest 
		type of architecture you can imagine and makes Hong Kong distinctive for 
		this reason. There is little or no traffic on the city’s broad modern 
		streets that make up the foreign section, because the this section is 
		almost entirely English and is so small that one can walk around the 
		block to do his business and cars are not needed.<br><br>Tram cars, 
		double-decker busses, taxis, modern rubber-tired rickshas and sedan 
		chairs answer everyone’s needs. For 10 cents you can ride anywhere.<br>
		<br>The native city in which 821,999 of the 850,000 live is quite a 
		different story. With the exception of the main thoroughfare, the 
		streets are narrow and dirty with smokey walled typical Hong Kongish 
		buildings of a few stories all decorated with the day’s wash. In the 
		narrow alleyways vendors set up their transportable shops, selling 
		everything from a full meal to fountain pens. Food is for sale 
		everywhere. Whenever buyers congregate, beggars are there to ply their 
		trade. Children follow us everywhere repeating over and over again pleas 
		we can’t understand. This alms business in China is a flourishing 
		profession.<br><br>Along the waterfront the seeker can certainly find 
		the romance of the East. The wharves and banks are littered with native 
		crafts of every description, Sampans are always on hand to ferry one 
		almost anyplace for a ridiculously small price. A constant flow of 
		activity goes on between the larger junks and shore. Men, women, and 
		children all are busy loading the boats with supplies and cargo. Portage 
		in China is done by suspending equal weights or measures of material 
		from the ends of a pliable bamboo bar supported on the shoulders. By 
		moving with a light jog the pairs of coolies are able to move in rhythm 
		with the bouncing motion of the poles. Tremendous weights are carried in 
		this manner, usually accompanied by a weird chanting, either to aid the 
		rhythm or ease the pain. We couldn’t guess which.<br><br>Great Britain 
		owns a number of the islands in this region including Hong Kong. Four 
		square miles of the peninsula opposite the island jutting out from the 
		mainland are also under British control, ceded to her by China in 1861. 
		On this point is located part of the city of Kowloon which serves as the 
		docking space for large sea going ships. A number of long wharves extend 
		out into the bay, sheltered by the jutting Kowloon headland. It was at 
		one of these wharves that our excursions in Hong Kong have begun and 
		ended. It is very difficult during bad weather and during certain tides 
		to bring the ships in because these large vessels must make a complete 
		turn to come alongside, a maneuver accomplished safely under only normal 
		conditions.<br><br>The currency here is the Hong Kong dollar and it 
		equals 100 cents. The ratio in value to gold is now 1 to 3, so that the 
		dollar is the equivalent of 33 1/2 cents in our money. Living is 
		therefore very cheap. Ted and I seldom change our money with the 
		changers who come on board unless we know the exact value and what we 
		should receive. The barred window of a money exchange can be found in 
		almost every block of a Chinese city. It is a thriving business.<br><br>
		The harbor of Hong Kong, or Victoria, is one of the most picturesque we 
		can hope to see. It is crowded with craft of every sort and description. 
		Great drab battleships lie quietly at anchor, while tiny native junks 
		and sampans scud by on the breeze that seems to blow across the water 
		constantly. Speeding motor launches and swift passenger ferries run 
		their courses, always giving the right of way to the billowy sailing 
		vessels. Such activity! We can easily sit for hours watching the ever 
		moving story of life in the East before us. When the wind dies, men, 
		women, and children all lend a hand on the quaint sailing oar, supplying 
		raw had power characteristic of the East. It is impossible for me to do 
		justice to the remarkable life on a Chinese waterway. The sooner you get 
		here to see China as it has been for centuries, the better it will be, 
		for China is slowly changing, and although the taste of the ancient will 
		not be lost for years, it will change and you should come now to see a 
		civilization almost untouched by the rest of the world’s social, and 
		economic advances.<br><br>Unfortunately, since during our entire stay 
		here a heavy fog has hidden the Peak, so that we are unable to enjoy the 
		view we might have had from there. Our stay in Canton is also 
		unrecorded, due to a mistake I made in loading, for the film did not 
		roll through. Nothing new about such mistakes, but we will do better, 
		for these scenes are there just once.<br><br>Now a little about the 
		facts of our stay here. Arriving here on Monday from Manila, we put up 
		at the Kowloon “Y”. Tuesday was spent writing letters. At one o’clock, 
		Mr.Kinsey, Rotarian and assistant passenger agent for NYK, from Long 
		beach, took us to the Rotary lunch. There we enjoyed a tasty meal with 
		seconds, preceded by drinks for all but us teetotalers, and topped off 
		by an extremely interesting and enlightening discussion by Dr. Rushbrook 
		on “Dictatorship vs Democracy”. We would like to have talked with him 
		but other engagements kept him busy. We have much to tell you of the 
		different concepts of Rotary encountered thus far. In Honk Kong Rotary 
		is not taken seriously by most, and such an article as “The Real 
		Rotarian” you mailed us would get the horselaugh. They claim they are 
		“too busy”. Incidentally, I asked the wrong question. “Why are there not 
		Chinese members?”<br><br>Out of the group, one man came forward offering 
		his time and advice in the matter of entertainment for us. He was Mr. 
		Kay, Security of the local C. of C and anxious to help us out. His 
		suggestion of motoring around the island was happily accepted. This trip 
		so famous for its scenery was spoiled for us by the dense fog and mist 
		covering everything in the higher altitudes. We were interested in the 
		method they had devised and were carrying out to provide the city’s 
		water supply. As it is now, city water is turned off every day from 11 
		AM to 5 PM because of the shortage. Over 100 inches of rain fall every 
		year, but it comes all at once and is lost into the sea. By constructing 
		troughs along the hillsides that empty into reservoirs, it is hoped 
		water will soon be plentiful year round.<br><br>At Repulse Bay on the 
		southern side of the island we enjoyed tea and cakes, five cups to be 
		exact, and every cake in sight. You see, this is the way we can get 
		along without dinner. Economy! After this delightful repast, we went 
		completely around the island, arriving at the Y about nightfall. Then we 
		had a quiet evening getting ready for Canton.<br><br>We had wired Bill 
		Lange, Carl’s close friend, to meet us at the station, so it was with a 
		sinking sensation that we looked in vain for him in the crowded mass off 
		humanity at Canton station after the three hour ride from Kowloon. But 
		sure enough, a few minutes later we spotted our blonde friend striding 
		toward us. I think he was just as glad to see us as we were to find him. 
		At least that is what we gathered from his greeting.<br><br>We put 
		ourselves entirely in his hands for the duration. We started off in 
		rickshas to see the sights I will describe; As evening drew near we went 
		to the Lingnan dock and took the launch upriver three miles to the 
		University. The Lingnan Campus is a delightful place on Honan Island in 
		the Pearl River. The buildings are all done in a combination of European 
		and Chinese style. Carved Chinese tiled roofs finished in reds, greens, 
		and blues give the colorful touch. New buildings are being added all of 
		the time as the college expands. Every student has his own bicycle, and 
		the many campus walks are scenes of constant streams of bikes moving 
		between classes.<br><br>For 10 cents, Canton, one may take the boat to 
		Canton, while many prefer to make the trip by bike. The students live in 
		dormitories much like Stanford, but not as comfortable. The exchange 
		students from America are scattered through the halls, each with a 
		Chinese roommate. They get along well together. Bill, along with the 
		other “exchangers”, has at his command enough of a Chinese vocabulary to 
		secure any of his needs. Through Wong’s aid in this difficult language, 
		Bill could speak quite well by the time his year ended. Chinese is a 
		terribly difficult language to master because there are so many meanings 
		to a word and they have hardly audible differences in pronunciation. 
		Bill may say a word and it will be perfectly understood but if he turns 
		around and says the same thing to someone else it might convey nothing.<br>
		<br>Lingnan is blessed with twenty-three students from America, one of 
		the finest most companionable and hospitable groups I have ever met. Of 
		the 23, four are girls who have entered into the spirit of everything 
		with the energy of boys. I believe that this group is governed by a 
		finer and more complete understanding than any fraternity in America. 
		Everyone is having the time of life studying China and its culture, and 
		enjoying the companionship of Chinese friends. Many of the fellows wear 
		Chinese dress much of the time. The native clothing is so comfortable 
		and suited to the climate. Bill has outfitted himself completely in silk 
		robes and jackets that he wears most of the time. However his blonde 
		hair fools no one.<br><br>Baxter House is the fountainhead of the 
		group’s activities. This building with its three cheery Chinese “amas” 
		to wait on the guys is maintained by the American Foundation at Lingnan 
		and administered by Dr. Henry who was on his way to America during our 
		visit, much to our disappointment. Here at the Baxter House everyone 
		enjoys an American breakfast.The other two meals, usually Chinese, are 
		taken at meeting places on the campus. In the evenings, usually a large 
		group gathers around the fire to “:chew the fat” or on moonlight nights, 
		a sampan trip on the river will fill the bill. No one seems to study 
		very hard. The excuse given is that the Chinese students as a whole are 
		slower to learn than the Americans who thus keep up with classes with 
		very little trouble. <br><br>The Exchangers are drawn from universities 
		all over the U.S.A., from Harvard to Occidental. Some have been picked 
		through grades, others by general qualifications, which seems the most 
		sensible . The group coming over has grown larger each year and should 
		approach 50 or so next fall. It is a wonderful opportunity to learn and 
		Bill is a lucky fellow.<br><br>As I have said, the bunch opened their 
		arms to us and we felt as if we were studying with them. From arrival to 
		departure every minute was full of something new and exciting. Our first 
		evening we spent as guests with the group of Mr. Lin, head of the Bureau 
		of Sericulture, who treated us all to a delicious dinner, or should I 
		say “feast”, of chinese chow. We consumed about eight or ten tasty 
		dishes helped by as many toasts with the strongest most distasteful wine 
		I can imagine. But it was all part of the game and everyone entered in 
		with enthusiasm, even if the stuff did scorch your throat. By the time 
		the evening was over, Mr. Lin, Mr. Fung the honored guest from Peking 
		University and I were bosom friends and any information I wish in the 
		future they will be happy to supply.<br><br>We were told that we had hit 
		the group on one of “their” nights, so in a riotous mood everyone piled 
		into a bus that would take us to see “Grandma”. Who this was we had no 
		idea, but trouped along with the rest for some fun. After walking down 
		the middle of a dark street for severa;l blocks beyond the last bus 
		stop, the leaders turned into a narrow lighted doorway and whooped up 
		two flights of stairs to a typical Canton dive. There, Grandma, a harsh 
		blond of forty or so with a boyish bob and a couple of buck teeth 
		greeted us, not exactly with open arms, but almost. For an hour or so we 
		enjoyed some dancing and the cake of a birthday party going on in one 
		corner.<br><br>But the most important event of the day I have neglected 
		to mention. Ted, Bill, Phil Morse and I had a refreshing basketball 
		workout on one of Lingnan’s outdoor courts in the afternoon. Strangely 
		enough, since arriving in Japan, so much has been going on that the idea 
		of playing some basketball has offered small inducement. On Thursday 
		afternoon we enjoyed a real workout, this time playing against the 
		Exchanger’s team that has high hopes for Canton championships. The $800 
		cup would be theirs if only we would forget our trip and stay and play 
		with them. We’ll be anxious to hear how everything turns out.<br><br>
		Each Thursday night the Americans gather in Baxter House for dinner with 
		some leading person of affairs in South China. We were very fortunate to 
		be present at such an occasion on our last evening. By this time we felt 
		as though we had been at Lingnan for months and were really a part of 
		the group. Mr. Kn, Canton Minister of Foreign Affairs from Nanking, was 
		the honored guest. After dinner we enjoyed his complete and 
		straightforward discussion of the struggle going on with Japan--really 
		struggle between conservative business and radical militarism. We were 
		told by friends that he had given us the inside dope because reporters 
		and spies were not present. <br><br>It was with regret that the next day 
		we had to be on our way, leaving them the invitation to say hello to us 
		in California. We will always be indebted to them for their kindness and 
		especially indebted to Bill Lange.<br><br>After thoughts and pick ups:<br>
		<br>The Stanford Exchangers were Margaret Woolverton, Hal Fulkerson, and 
		Bill Lange. Hal is from Ukiah and is doing fine at Lingnan, in full 
		bloom, red hair and all, and is the basketballer of the group. Hal 
		really knows his buckets because of his study under Mr. Bunn. Through 
		him we hope to meet the bunch in Europe and return with them to America. 
		We will contact him in Berlin and Bill in Heidelberg.<br><br>We 
		purchased for ourselves in Canton one black silk padded short coat for 
		$2.33 American apiece. We got them because they are so practical to 
		study in during winter at Stanford and because they will be handy for 
		fancy dress affairs. They of course are tailor made.<br><br>On our 
		arrival at Kowloon at 4 PM Friday we immediately crossed the bay to call 
		at NYK for final instructions. We had understood that the Suwa was to 
		leave Saturday afternoon, so we felt there was plenty of time to get 
		last minute things done. But can you imagine our surprise when Mr. 
		Kinsey informed us that the ship was sailing at 6 AM Saturday, and that 
		left us an hour to complete transactions. We thanked our lucky star that 
		we had not waited until 4PM to take the Canton train.<br><br>We have no 
		pictures of Canton because I made a mistake in loading the Contax-tough 
		luck, but we are still living and thus learning. We did make our boat.<br>
		<br>In order to land at Marseilles we had to pay $6 gold head tax and 
		our fares were $6 from Naples to Marseilles, since the ship dos not stop 
		at Naples. Our tickets and cabin were all secured and we were all set.<br>
		<br>The next few hours were spent making our last purchases, enjoying a 
		filling dinner at Jimmy’s and seeing Will Rogers in “Steamboat Round the 
		Bend” at a local theater with Mr. Key. These purchases consisted ot two 
		Chinese hats((0 cents gold), one dozen more handkerchiefs and the 
		bargaining we did would make your heart sing, Dad. We spent a full half 
		hour making one purchase, running back and forth between shops, finally 
		bringing the price down 15 %, and perhaps getting the best of the best 
		shop in town. Oh yea? It’s the great Oriental sport and we are in good 
		shape for bickering in Europe. Dad you would have the time of your life 
		over here being “&quot;Sco†chy&quot;. Ivory lions, teak lions, brass lions, jade 
		lions, and every shopkeeper anxious to bargain, thinking that anyone who 
		buys an object with less than a half hour’s bargaining is a fool. These 
		Chinese are clever business men and appreciate sagacity in dealings with 
		them.<br><br>A little about our ship and traveling companions.<br><br>
		The Suwa Maru is one of the older ships of the “Maru Line”, as Mom likes 
		to say. We are again fortunate in being quartered in a first class cabin 
		and taking meals in “second”. Everything about the liner is comfortable 
		and homey, well suited for the next few weeks’ sailing. Our fellow 
		passengers, both first and second classes, are a lively and 
		companionable group. We are looking forward to many good times in their 
		company.<br><br>For table mates we have a young man of 25 traveling 
		around the world and writing travelogues on his most interesting 
		experiences; a young Russian business man going to Singapore; the 
		Japanese assistant purser with whom we are on the best of terms; and a 
		lovely English couple enroute to London on leave. I must tell you about 
		them. They are a white haired pair, parents of six grown children, and 
		have lived in Tientsin for many years, this being their first visit to 
		London since 1917. Mr. Shellem is a railroad engineer and student of 
		psychology if there ever was one. We enjoy greatly his comments on 
		people and hs jovial manner. Everyone represents a book to him and he 
		studies each as if he were writing the book. We hope to learn much from 
		him as he reads us.<br><br>Another traveling companion is Charlie 
		Chaplin. He is on board with Paulette Goddard, his fiancee, en route to 
		Singapore and Bali. Our first acquaintance with him came when we found 
		ourselves to be in the same lifeboat during the drill. Of course under 
		such trying conditions we immediately felt something in common, 
		resulting in an exchange of ideas. The ultimate result was a discussion 
		of various national and international problems, lasting all morning and 
		much of the afternoon. We feel like old friends now.<br><br>Charlie is a 
		short, medium built man, with a lithe athletic frame. In his youth he 
		was a marathon runner and now plays tennis for exercise. And he plays it 
		well. His graying hair makes him look older than his 46 years while his 
		agility and youthful good humor subtract years. Charlie is an actor 
		through and through. Gesticulations with his hands, expressions on his 
		face, and modulation of his voice, dramatize every description or add 
		force to any statement. He is an unaffected, unpretentious soft spoken 
		man who seems to enjoy the companionship of others and whose interest in 
		others makes him immediately acceptable. We hope to know him better 
		before his departure.<br><br>Ted and I are discussing the possibility of 
		leaving the Suwa at Suez, getting our refund, and taking a steamer from 
		Alexandria to Naples. In this way we will have time to see Cairo and 
		possibly Luxor of which Major Overton speaks at such length. This move 
		would eliminate having to travel down to Rome and back up again, and 
		eliminate also the extra passage fee from Naples to Marseilles. We will 
		see about it at Singapore and write you later. We may finally go by 
		train from Singapore to Penang and take advantage of Mr.Lee’s 
		invitation.<br><br>We received a swell letter from Wins and I will write 
		him again now. The reason that I didn’t do that before leaving Japan is 
		that I wanted to wait and really have something to tell him. I know 
		he’ll understand. We are happy to receive your first pictures, Bruce. 
		The trouble with them is that you’ve given them too much light, 
		necessitating too quick a removal from the developer. Half that much 
		light would be plenty and to give them a shiny finish, polish up the 
		ferrotyping plates by cleaning them with hot water and then rolling the 
		pictures down with a blotter. You know how. Or you can first roll them 
		between the blotters and get the water out, and then lay them down 
		between dry portions of the blotter under weight. Send us some more. 
		Since your set us some we will return the complement.<br><br>We are 
		shipping our duffel bag from Singapore filled with things we won’t need 
		now. We will let you know the ship it is coming on and the contents-a 
		number of “620” negatives, One roll of negatives has moisture spots on 
		it and whether I can do anything with it is doubtful. You can have them 
		printed by Virgil if you wish. The pictures will be tiny but cheap, and 
		I will, enlarge them on our return. These pictures are our first attempt 
		with the Contax and must be discounted as such. We have been a 
		handicapped by absence of a filter and sunshade which we will try and 
		get in Singapore. I will catalogue all of the photos so you will know 
		the score.<br><br>Our next letter will probably be from Colombo, and we 
		will have oodles more to tell. We can hardly wait to arrive in Singapore 
		to see and feel the romance of the “Melting Pot of the East”, but more 
		important to hear from you. I hope Miss Eschbacher has been able to 
		decipher my scribbling. My fountain pen collapsed and I am lost without 
		it. These letters are really horrible examples of English, but we have 
		so much to write and so little time to write it for we always seem to b 
		rushing. We hope Elizabeth received her handkerchief safely. Tell her 
		that it is prettier than practical and would look good in a frame...D<br>
		<br><br>March 16...Suwa Maru<br><br><br><br>Just one month from today I 
		will be eighteen years old. and I know the trip so far has rounded out 
		my first ten and eight years that give much satisfaction, thanks to you.<br>
		<br>On Wednesday, the tenth, after a short stay in Hong Kong Dick and I 
		boarded the early morning train in Kowloon for Canton. At the station 
		before we left we had a great time with the coolie who was carrying our 
		bag. The coolie always gives you a price for carrying the luggage and 
		when it comes to the payoff they demand more, so you must show them the 
		door. It’s some business but the coolie’s live so poorly you can hardly 
		blame them for wanting something extra.<br><br>Leaving Kowloon, the 
		railway heads into the interior. It runs through miles and miles of rice 
		and vegetable paddies and here and there is a village with stone 
		stable-like dwellings and adobe thatched roof houses. Near the coast and 
		standing high on the hills above are a few dignified European homes of 
		the well to do of that vicinity. It is a fact that the poor Chinese who 
		must work in the fields or carry heavy loads all day eat but twice 
		during that day, in the middle of morning and early evening. And as it 
		was almost breakfast time, smoke was pouring from doors and windows, or 
		perhaps curling up through a hole in a roof. The old concrete highway 
		next to the railroad was dotted with men, women,, and children on the 
		way to the fields or neighboring villages. As it was raining some had on 
		straw raincoats over their dirty dark blue clothes and many wore the 
		wide brimmed straw hat to keep the mist from their eyes.<br><br>We were 
		surprised to see stone graves of a peculiar circular shape set into the 
		side of the low hills that dot the landscape. At first we thought they 
		were sort of a water system, but as the rain let up and vision cleared, 
		we could make out rows and rows of small barrel-like urns around these 
		odd looking graves. These laces for the dead, we understand, are built 
		in certain spots that tradition says will be best for those who have 
		died. Of course these burial structures are those of the well-to-do 
		Chinese, but around them and far outnumbering them are the grave mounds 
		of the poor. In China these mounds are a great problem for they are 
		sacred and the people will not allow them to be moved. Thus a tremendous 
		area of arable land goes untouched by the plow. A common scene along the 
		way is that of a farmer, bare footed and with straw hat, guiding his 
		plow through the water soaked yellow soil behind his faithful water 
		buffalo or caribou.<br><br>In all of the few stations we stopped at 
		there were porters waiting to carry luggage, but contrary to the foreign 
		standard, these were poorly dressed women wearing straw hats and 
		carrying a bamboo pole about five feet long. We watched them tie up 
		someone’s suitcase and boxes, half on each end of the pole, and then 
		start off with the pole on their shoulders. A thing of this kind, women 
		doing such hard work, is hard to understand, but there are many customs 
		here in the Orient that one must get accustomed to.<br><br>About noon 
		the train pulled into Canton. We had wired Bill Lang, Dick’s Stanford 
		chum of our arrival and he waiting for us there in the busy station. 
		With him we ricksha through the outskirts of Canton to the river where 
		we boarded the launch to Lingnan University.<br><br>The one full day 
		that we spent in Canton was an eventful one. In the morning, Bill Lang, 
		Chuck, Dick, and I started the three mile trip on bicycles. It was fun 
		riding along the red earth roads between the rice and vegetable paddies 
		of bright green. We stopped to examine a stone grave like the ones seen 
		from the train, Further on were the first stores bordering the road. 
		Chinese eating shops and open kitchens dominated the area, but it was 
		disappointing to see the filth in which they existed. Nothing is wasted 
		here. That which isn’t consumed by humans is gorges on by, sloppy hogs, 
		or “skin and bone” dogs and cats.<br><br>Soon we entered the city proper 
		and were conscious of tremendous human traffic. Intermingled were the 
		slaps of bare feet and clatter of footwear on the dirty wet pavement, 
		along with the cries of ambitious peddlers, and blares of bus horns. 
		Canton, the central city of South China and situated on the Pearl River 
		has a population of about one million, one eighth of which live on boats 
		on the busy river. We expected to find winding narrow streets and were 
		surprised to find ourselves riding on wide well paved streets.<br><br>
		Our first experience was to walk through Shameen, the foreign quarter of 
		the city. We then crossed town to see the municipal buildings which 
		greatly resembled those of the new civic center in Shanghai with their 
		blue, green, and red roofs and modern light colored walls.<br><br>We 
		climbed the 650 steps to the memorial to Sun Yat Sen, famed military 
		leader and popular Cantonese hero. It was a shame that the weather was 
		poor for this tall tower-like structure can command a view of the city 
		and surrounding country. Not far away stood the flower pagoda which 
		marked the old wall that surrounded the city centuries past.<br><br>By 
		this time we all were hungry, so our student friends invited us to lunch 
		and we were soon seated at a table in one of the more modern 
		restaurants. The menu was in Chinese, and as our friends could not make 
		much out of it, they simply drew a line through one of the rows of 
		characters. And then the fun began. Plate after plate arrived and 
		disappeared empty, until we were fairly bursting. As our friends paid 
		the surprisingly reasonable bill Dick and I managed to wash our hands 
		and faces with the steaming hot towel brought by the waitress.<br><br>
		Directly, we were back on the street, tooting our tiny horns are the 
		people in front of us and weaving through the mass of humanity. Canton 
		is noted for its streets more or less assigned to the various crafts. It 
		was our host’s intention that we see them and we did. We saw pieces of 
		ivory being transformed into small figures by use of a revolving metal 
		bit turned by pumping feet. And along the ivory street we entered shops 
		with precious carvings representing years and years of careful 
		workmanship. Further along was the Jade Street with its smaller shops 
		and intriguing displays. And then we turned off the crowded thoroughfare 
		and were led down a dark stone paved alley. Soon on either side appeared 
		shops containing black teakwood furniture ornamented with intricate 
		carvings of dragons and Chinese conceptions of wild life.<br><br>For 
		quite a while we meandered down the maze of narrow filthy streets trying 
		to create as much of a mental picture as possible. And when we finally 
		turned back we realized how easily would we could have gotten lost in 
		such a place where alleys go on forever.<br><br>We returned to the main 
		street, then made for the Brass Street where there was great industry, 
		pounding and polishing the shiny metal objects. Nearby were the 
		embroidery shops so we stepped in and examined the finest from expensive 
		mandarin coats to exquisite wall hangings cut from ancient royal dress.<br>
		<br>When we finished acting our part as tourists, we set out to do a 
		little shopping. We looked all over Canton for Chinese slippers large 
		enough for our almost twelve's, but none were to be found. The Chinese 
		topknot hats are also too small. We would go from shop to shop in vain, 
		with a crowd of inquisitive locals at our heels. The shop owners had 
		great fun joking among themselves about our “:gunboat” feet ad 
		“fatheads”. But we could take it.<br><br>As it was getting late in the 
		afternoon we decided to take one more look at Canton and then head for 
		Lingnan. We passed the bird market where the shop widows were filled 
		with bird cages. Up and down the main streets rolled huge loads p of 
		stone on roughly hewn carts pulled by five or six men or women who 
		strained at their ropes with every possible ounce of strength. It ws not 
		uncommon to pass a funeral with its band and banners. Beggars combed the 
		streets and gutters, dressed in gunny sacks and coated with dirt. Every 
		now and then we would pass a “walking kitchen”. Strung from each end of 
		a bamboo pole were cases of steaming food and the peddler would stride 
		along balancing this load on his shoulder. Above all of this fascinating 
		show are the two or three story buildings with their advertisements in 
		brightly painted banners and signs hanging from above.<br><br>Dick and I 
		were captivated by the feeling of adventure we experienced as new sights 
		unfolded. On our way back to the University we stopped a one of the 
		villages. We entered it through a large hole in a deteriorating wall and 
		found ourselves among bare one storied buildings built with stones or 
		adobe and bamboo. We hadn’t expected a brass band but there was a 
		reception committee consisting of all of the little kids in this 
		community. We were sorry to see our inquisitive reception committee turn 
		into a group of fugitives so Dick snapped their picture. We wandered 
		down the dirt alleys along an open sewer, looking into the dwellings of 
		a different world. Outside the village were the green fields dotted with 
		men and women bent over at work. And off to one side was the village 
		shrine, neglected and run down, giving the indication that piety and 
		worship is passing. It was getting dark so we hurried back to school.<br>
		<br>A part of Canton that must not be left out is the river and its 
		thousands of sampans and junks. Along the shore are the sampans in which 
		much of Canton life is centered. It is remarkable how so many thousands 
		have lived and will live in their floating slums. Anchored out on the 
		muddy river are the junks, and docked to one side are the “flower boat” 
		of ill repute. And of course to top it all off is the Chinese Navy-a few 
		obsolete tubs anchored out in the stream and surrounded by the swarm of 
		daily life.<br><br>The following noon when we boarded the train for Hong 
		Kong we had one idea in mind, and that was that some day we would hope 
		to return and spend both time and money in Canton. The return trip was 
		uneventful, and we didn’t miss anything we went by. We are becoming 
		expert in keeping our yes open. When the train stopped in Kowloon, Dick 
		and I carried out our usual plan for disembarkation. As we were in a 
		hurry, Dick would be the first to alight from the car. I would be ready 
		to shove the suitcase out of the window onto his shoulder, and when that 
		was done I get the easy job of the light boxes or coats.<br><br>I am 
		writing all of this trash from the Suwa and it is getting hot. And when 
		it gets hot the mind slows and when the mind slows the pen goes 
		raggedly, but don’t ne alarmed.<br><br>We have had an invaluable 
		experience in the Orient and yet we have hardly scratched the surface. 
		Dick and I agree that China is indescribable. There is so much and words 
		are so few that it makes the task of writing more difficult. But we 
		realize we will profit from it, and are enjoying the whole show. Dick 
		has written of our shipmates and of our interest in them. Our next port 
		is Singapore and we are anticipating being there. We were delighted to 
		receive your letter in Hong Kong and they gave us a great deal of 
		happiness, for we appreciate them more the farther we distance ourselves 
		from home.<br><br>Dick and I hope that everything is fine with you and 
		that “Let Lyon Guard Your Goods” s booming, and that there is no worry 
		about the two boys traveling safely across the world. And a final 
		thought- there is nothing like the connections based on friendship that 
		Rotary is providing, It has made the difference. T<br><br><br>March 19 
		Suwa<br><br><br><br>It was just two months ago that we started from home 
		and what a glorious time it has been! But along with all the fun and 
		sight seeing I believe that I have learned more in the last two months 
		by just talking to people, and people are so willing to talk with us. 
		This of course is in the field of general knowledge, but there has been 
		and will be much for us to learn along specific lines. Of course we had 
		several long talks with Charlie Chaplin and others on the ship, and 
		since everyone has a personal opinion, it is hard to judge correctly. 
		The other evening we had an interesting discussion with a Dr. Blackburn, 
		an Englishman, concerning our future vocations. First of all it was 
		decided to choose one from medicine, law, engineering, or business. It 
		was not long before he found out we are not bookworms which in his mind 
		eliminated us from medicine and law. Of course Dick and I, and 
		especially Dick, like to argue and that is a requisite for the law. And 
		then we began talking of future fields in the way of Dad’s business, 
		transportation, and engineering. And Dr. Blackburn expressed the feeling 
		that one of the great fields to be in is transportation by air from 
		either the business or engineering standpoint. Of course these are just 
		thoughts and one of the many viewpoints we will encounter.<br><br>Since 
		we left Hong Kong where it was foggy and cool, we have missed the hot 
		weather because of the rains but there will be plenty of heat ahead. We 
		are now on our way to Penang where we will spend one night in port, a 
		disappointment for we had hoped to see a bit of that country. 
		Nevertheless we have just spent a marvelous day in Singapore with Mr. 
		Raper, the President of the Rotary Club. It is a long story and we 
		surely packed the twenty-five hour visit by doing and seeing everything 
		possible.<br><br>After disembarking at 4 o’clock we were taken by Mr. 
		Raper to the Adolphi Hotel for tea and then out for a little shopping 
		and required business. At American Express we found letters from Sally 
		Ammen and Dorothy Shields but were sorry not to hear from you.<br><br>
		Since Prince Pura Chotra was ill, we were unable to see him, but Mr. 
		Raper had us well in hand. His invitation to stay at his home for the 
		night was enthusiastically accepted, and we found his home to be one of 
		beauty with extensive grounds around it. That evening we enjoyed dinner 
		at the Seaview Hotel and then went to a permanent carnival called the 
		New World. What we enjoyed most were the Malayan and Chinese dramas 
		taking place in open theaters. The Malayans were dressed in fantastic 
		costumes and they did their acting to the accompaniment of cymbals 
		monotonously clanging. The stage manager would walk about the stage 
		among the players while the show was going on, changing the sets and all 
		the while smoking cigarettes. Every now and then he would sit down on 
		one of the stage chairs and watch the drama. It seemed a bit crazy to 
		us.<br><br>We slept well and got up at 6:30 to walk through the famous 
		botanical gardens which were opposite our lodging. There was an 
		extensive variety of trees and plants typical of the area. They were the 
		most beautiful and well kept gardens we have ever seen and deserve their 
		fame in Singapore.<br><br>When breakfast was over we drove into the 
		country through fields of rubber trees to a rubber factory. Since our 
		guide could speak little English we had to show him around in order to 
		see anything, but the process was interesting because we have studied it 
		in school and knew what we were seeing. We were then taken to lunch at 
		the famous Raffles Hotel, and then taken to the Raffles Museum. Sir 
		Thomas Raffles was the founder of Singapore and because of his late 
		prominence and catchy name, he has been honored by the extensive use of 
		the name.<br><br>Soon our time for departure rolled around, and after 
		thanking Mr. Raper, we boarded our ship. Native Malayans in their 
		slender dugout canoes came alongside and dived for coins. Since the 
		passengers had a lot of left over change not worth anything anywhere 
		else, the natives had a thriving business. I was surprised see one old 
		gray haired fellow smoking a small cigar, but every thing was explained 
		when he dived from his canoe for while in the air he would reverse the 
		cigar in his mouth with the lighted end inside.<br><br>The trip through 
		the Straits was made on our way out of the harbor and we could see part 
		of the heavy fortifications the British are constructing so as to 
		impregnable from the air. The British are going after it in a big way.<br>
		<br>In Singapore we saw Mr. Chaplin and his party several times and had 
		fun insisting that he was following us around. While we were in Mr. 
		Raper’s home, Dick and I consumed a lot of liquid as lemonade. During 
		the 24 hours we had five glasses at different times, but in such a 
		climate a high fluid intake is demanded.<br><br>The Raffles Museum is a 
		fine building, and its collections are standard for the area. They had 
		the skeleton of a whale and beside it were its arms, or fins, very much 
		like a human’s. Mr. Raper said that the correct name of the Malay 
		peninsula is not Malay alone but Malaya. The countryside is full of 
		fascination with its pineapple fields, groves of rubber trees, and 
		native huts.<br><br>When we arrived in Singapore I had the notion that 
		it is a city of evil and dangerous characters, and that the life was 
		centered around boats in a harbor. On the contrary, it is truly lovely 
		with such a green surrounding and warm atmosphere. The buildings are 
		modern and dignified, so my mind has changed. <br><br><br><br>MARCH 21<br>
		<br><br><br>It is now 8 AM and we have just left Penang in the distance. 
		We arrived last night in the harbor about 10 o’clock and by eleven the 
		launch was ferrying us shoreward. For the first time in my life I saw 
		phosphorescent water, and it was grand. As the boat would plow through 
		the sea, the foam seemed to ignite and folds of silver would form, 
		break, and recede to be left behind. The darker the night,the brighter 
		the glow.<br><br>In Penang everything was quiet because of the late hour 
		so we were driven to the amusement park and there saw a Malayan drama, 
		similar to the one in Singapore. We returned to the ship about 1 AM and 
		at 6 AM awoke in time to get a last glimpse of the harbor. The sunrise 
		was special as it blended one color with another until the clouds and 
		sky were full of silver. For the first time we got a glimpse of the 
		entire island of Penang. And it was green everywhere. It is hilly in the 
		center, the highest point at 2700 feet, and the town of Penang lies at 
		the northeast corner of the island facing the western coast of Malaya 
		two miles in the distance. The pilot has left our ship in his launch and 
		we are now under full steam. T<br><br><br>March 21 Suwa<br><br>This 
		marks the fourth day since Penang. The weather is perfect. White 
		luminous clouds are scattered above from a sky where the sun beats down 
		unmercifully. However, cool salt sea breezes temper the heat to the 
		point that it is enjoyable.<br><br>Each day Ted and I go through an 
		organized conditioning. We start out by taking a nap after lunch, then a 
		sunbath for gradually extending times, topped by exercises and a 
		refreshing cold shower. The rest of the day is spent reading and 
		writing, broken by short deck games. We are enjoying the books you send 
		us and we study them diligently to get ready for the sights ahead.<br>
		<br>Because of exorbitant prices from Alexandria to Naples, we will 
		continue on to Marseilles. We will buy our bikes there, ride to Genoa, 
		and then go the rest of the way in Italy by train. We are told that it 
		is possible to get a rate reduction if a circuit is made. It will be 
		safe to send letters to Genoa arriving there up to May 20 or so. The 
		next batch should go to Munich. We hope we did not miss any letters in 
		Singapore, and if we have, they will be forwarded to Geneva. Perhaps 
		some still await us in Colombo.<br><br>As to whether to go to Cairo or 
		not between Suez and Port Said, we will decide in Colombo. The thing is 
		that we are not going to pay $20 in gold for the visa. The final outcome 
		rests on this. I believe some type of transit visa is available.<br><br>
		We have quite a varied group of travelers aboard. There are a number of 
		French, Dutch, Japanese, English, and Americans. The French are a very 
		nice but sensitive race, at least from first impressions. The Dutch are 
		very likable. The Japanese keep to themselves, giving us little chance 
		to become aquatinted. The English are jovial and potbellied and we get 
		along with them easily, as we get the worst in most arguments. The Suwa 
		is much slower than was the Hiye. In perfect weather the best we can do 
		is 354 miles a day, while the Hiya managed 400 in rough weather. We’ll 
		get there, I expect. Ted and I have agreed that that writing the long 
		and detailed letters, as from Japan, is a bunch of “hooey”. The letters 
		take so much time and energy along with letters of thanks and others to 
		friends, that we feel we must be more sensible. As for writing a book 
		about our travels in the East, that is absurd. We would be like babes, 
		knowing so little of what we speak. As for “Bikes in Europe” the 
		prospect is more promising. However, please do not expect letters in 
		detail. The best we can do will be to sketch, elaborating at special 
		times. The time is short in Europe and we must make the most of it. I 
		hope also that friends will not expect long letters. We’ve written so 
		many we are “blue in the face”-something like eighty so far not 
		including half as many post cards.<br><br>The sea bag will be sent home 
		from Singapore They will let you know when it arrives. I neglected to 
		put in the rest of the films which are catalogued inside. We will take 
		them with us and send them home if opportunity presents. We’re anxious 
		to know how Bruce’s team did in the tournament. He might also be 
		interested to know that there is a fourteen-year old girl on board whom 
		he could really go for. She’s making a play for Ted right now since 
		nothing better is likely to turn up. I’ll try and keep everything under 
		control.<br><br>Anything you hear about fellows or girls coming to 
		Germany we would like to know. We will be in southern Germany and the 
		Rhine Valley from June first to July. We will probably miss the Olympics 
		unless we make a quick trip from Holland. Right now England and Bavaria 
		invite us the most, and that is where are time will be spent. We have 
		gained tremendous admiration for the German people and look forward to 
		knowing them. D<br><br><br>March 28 Suwa<br><br><br><br>Today is our 
		second at sea since leaving Colombo en route to Aden four days away. Our 
		memories of Colombo and the wonderful day we spent there will always be 
		fresh. We left Ceylon with a sweet taste in our mouths because of the 
		kindness shown us by Rotary President Nathanielez, who represents the 
		finest type of Indian. He treated us to real hospitality just because we 
		were sons of a brother Rotarian. Our day in Ceylon will be remembered as 
		one of the pleasantest of our trip.<br><br>It was six o’clock in the 
		morning when we awakened to receive our first glimpse of tropical Ceylon 
		of which we had heard so much. The ship was moving slowly inside the 
		great breakwater which extends a mile out to sea, forming a great calm 
		bay, the Port of Colombo. Nature had not favored the city with even a 
		semblance of a harbor so it was necessary for man to construct walls of 
		concrete to hold back the tides. However, the two entrances are so 
		narrow that entering in anything but good weather must be almost 
		impossible.<br><br>We had imagined that Colombo would present the same 
		appearance as beautiful Hong Kong-a white walled city extending along 
		the skirts of rugged verdant peaks and crags, but our first view 
		discouraged such allusions. The city is laid out along a level 
		waterfront with only blue sky and white clouds hazy with distance for a 
		background. We were told, however, that on clear days one may discern a 
		majestic cone shape peak behind Colombo.<br><br>The city itself is 
		constructed in the usual tropical style so prominent in Hong Kong and 
		Singapore, with white two and three storied buildings rising in tiers of 
		arches and colonnades. Many of the newest are built in a more modern 
		western style, presenting a more pleasant appearance to our eyes. Broad 
		clean streets, seldom found in American cities, radiate to every part of 
		the port. Traffic congestion is practically unknown, due the efficiency 
		of the native khaki clad police who carry out their duties in the shade 
		of extensive umbrellas. Their job is no cinch either, for they have 
		every imaginable type of vehicle to deal with.<br><br>Since Colombo is 
		Ceylon’s only outlet for its rubber, tin, fruits, and tea, these 
		products are transported right through the city’s heart by primitive 
		native drawn conveyances, all roughly hewn as Singhalese covered wagons 
		drawn by bulls in yokes. Such a cart might easily have been found in the 
		“Days of 49”, differing only in its coverage of canvas from the thatched 
		Singhalese wagon roof. Strange as it may seem, jinrickshas are an 
		institution in this city as well as in the rest of temperate Orient, but 
		if anyone wishes to cover any distance in a short time, new Diesel 
		busses run on regular schedules throughout the city. For such plutocrats 
		as Rotarians and ourselves small imported autos from abroad with dark 
		skinned chauffeurs are the rule.<br><br>Any uncertain ideas as to how we 
		would spend our day in Ceylon were quickly dispelled as we anchored. It 
		was the presence of the Reverend Nathanielez who made the difference as 
		he took everything into his own hands, much to our relief. His being a 
		native and leading man in civic affairs insured for us an instructive 
		and interesting day in Colombo. That we could not have been in better 
		hands we realized as the day went on.<br><br>After completing the 
		necessary passport examinations on board we clambered down the gangway 
		to a waiting launch that then wound its way through the usual native 
		water traffic of the orient. The boats were of ordinary design but were 
		propelled with oars having large cups for blades. Perhaps this type of 
		locomotion is the latest thing in Colombo, but these men worked awfully 
		hard to budge their sluggish crafts.<br><br>Our first usual duties of 
		the day ashore was changing money, looking for the America Express, and 
		purchasing a copy of Mark Twain’s “Innocent Abroad”, were quickly taken 
		care of. We then climbed into the Reverend's ten-year old Austin. He 
		told us he wouldn’t part with it for love or money, It hasn’t yet let 
		him down. From the way it ran there remains another ten years in store.<br>
		<br>I might speak of the Reverend and his place in Colombo society. He 
		holds the office of Charity Commissioner of the city and claims to be 
		the poorest member of the Rotary Club. However, from our observation of 
		his charming family, he is by far the richest man in town. He is fifty 
		years young and doesn’t look a day older than 49 1/2, and he is a real 
		boy at heart. He was flat broke when he went to Yale in his teens, 
		graduated “cum laude” and returned with a wife, a child, and $10,000. 
		His features are strong and distinctive; his skin is dark from ages in 
		the sun. He wears his collar backward, is crazy about football, and has 
		a rich sense of humor. Ted and I are surely fortunate in making our trip 
		when a man his caliber is in the Rotary office of honor.<br><br>The 
		morning was spent cruising about the city and the countryside, visiting 
		a number of Colombo’s points of interest. Even the narrow dirt roads on 
		which we drove through rural neighborhoods were neat and well kept. 
		Green tropical trees and foliage covered every foot of ground. Stately 
		coconut palms curving symmetrically this way and that; shorter jack 
		fruits trees with their enormous green shelled fruit; rows upon rows of 
		rubber trees not as yet tapped for their precious juice; bougainvillea 
		and many species of hibiscus-these are only a few of the trees and 
		shrubs which give Ceylon its mantle of green throughout the year.<br>
		<br>Along the river banks, half dressed men and women were completing 
		the day’s washing. They first soaked the clothes in the questionably 
		clean water, then beat them on rocks worn smooth by years of such 
		treatment, followed by a final rinsing and drying on lines strung 
		between palms leaning over the water’s edge.<br><br>Both sides of the 
		road are lined with dark-skinned natives carrying all sorts of bundles 
		or baskets on their heads. They stand as straight as the Washington 
		Monument and with an uncommon majesty as they balance their burdens. 
		Many different nationalities are represented in this steady stream of 
		human traffic. Singhalese, the natives of Ceylon, and Tamils and Moors 
		from India make up the population. A Singhalese can always be detected 
		by his long hair done up in a roll behind his head, while a Moor wears 
		his unmatchable fez. Few wear shoes Their feet look to be as tough as 
		alligator skin, and most men go bare from the waste up. Instead of 
		pants, multicolored skirts are worn, while in a few cases a G string 
		fills the bill. This is certainly the ideal clothing for such a 
		blistering hot climate.<br><br>In order that we might see a little of 
		the religious life, our host took us to the places of worship of the 
		three leading sects, Buddhism, Mohammadism, and Hinduism. The Hindu 
		shrine is now falling slowly into decay, but even in that crumpling 
		condition the delicately wrought images and pillars of stone give mute 
		testimony to the temple’s former beauty, and to the now passing 
		greatness of Hinduism in Ceylon. Buddhism's shrine was a disappointment. 
		The building itself was unimposing while the shiny new paste image of 
		Buddha entirely unappreciated by our eyes after seeing Nikko and Nara. A 
		small cheaply constructed mosque with its traditional pool for believers 
		to bathe in before praying was the Mohammedan contribution to our 
		education. However, from the looks of the pool with its slimy bottom on 
		which rested cans and dead fish, a believer would be much cleaner if he 
		took a mud bath.<br><br>The Galle Face Hotel was the next object of 
		interest for us. Here we received a long uninterrupted view of the 
		gorgeous shoreline to the south of Colombo, with native outrigger boats 
		resting on the white beach and small grass roofed huts adding to the 
		uniqueness of the scene. I could easily picture the Bounty mutineers 
		dragging their long boats on just such a palm lined beach as this.<br>
		<br>The next hour we spent pleasantly at Reverend Nathanielez’ home 
		midst the palms where we enjoyed a real Singhalese lunch with his 
		family. The meal, composed mostly of rice and curried chicken was a 
		little too hot for us, but refreshingly cool orange juice and ice water 
		made it tasty. The main difficulty here was that for every glass of 
		liquid we drank, the same amount appeared as perspiration. As for the 
		Reverend's family, we had hardly expected to find such a charming group 
		in a real Singhalese home, especially to an occidental’s eyes. Mrs. 
		Nathanielez is a fine looking woman. Her six daughters happily have 
		inherited her beauty combined with the strong features of their father 
		and the color of all is surprisingly light. Scholarships are waiting for 
		all of them at Yale anytime they wish to go, due to their father’s 
		remarkable record here. We will look back with pleasure always on these 
		so few hours spent in the hospitable atmosphere of a genuine Singhalese 
		home.<br><br>After securing photos of all we bade them “aloha’, not 
		goodbye and drove back to the city to complete purchases and calls 
		before boarding the ship at 4 o’clock. The Reverend insisted we meet the 
		American Consul with whom we had a pleasant chat. He is greatly admired 
		and a Rotarian of course,<br><br>Since time was short we took hurried 
		looks at the carvings in ebony and ivory in in colorful shops for which 
		Ceylon is famous. They are so delicate in workmanship and texture. 
		Through the ages of experience in staining and polishing the Singhalese 
		produce unsurpassed pieces. It was with great difficulty that we 
		refrained from spending precious dollars. But we were not to leave 
		Ceylon empty handed, for the Reverend saw to that. As we stood waiting 
		for our launch he presented each of us with a tiny beautiful ebony 
		elephant and a handful of even tinier elephant charms. Here was a 
		Rotarian and a man we will never forget. Those tiny elephants will 
		always bring back memories of his kindness to us. As I write, Ted and 
		Dick Jrs. with full shiny black hides, and big ears are gazing at me 
		from the shelf above. The sounds they utter are not audible to the ear, 
		only to the heart, a message of friendship and good cheer from Ceylon.<br>
		<br>As the Island of Ceylon faded into the distance we stood on the 
		after deck in silence, hoping to return some day. Every evening we have 
		seen beautiful sunsets. However, due to the low altitudes of cloud banks 
		the colored rays of the sun do not touch their lower visible sides, and 
		the brilliant effects are lost. We keep hoping that the he clouds will 
		lift to expose the real sunset colors to be then photographed.<br><br>
		The weather has been highly enjoyable so far. There is always a cool sea 
		breeze that tempers the heat to the point that we are experiencing 
		California weather. Yesterday Tad and I lay out in the sun of noonday, 
		and boy did we get red! The water is as calm as Lake Merritt. During the 
		night the red turned to tan and we are sporting such. Our shipmates 
		think we are crazy to lie in the sun. Many of them are from Java and do 
		their best to keep out of the sun. Several of the Dutch kids are as 
		brown as natives.<br><br>Ted and I are now the only Americans in second 
		class. All; the rest are English seaman and the officers, Dutch, French, 
		and Indian. We have an exceptionally fine group at our table. Mr. and 
		Mrs. Shellam have been most enjoyed. Mrs. Hill is from Ceylon, and a 
		charming Indian woman from Calcutta is a Mrs. Day who is on her way to 
		London to study. The officer at our table is Isamu Ikeda, 2nd Purser. In 
		our on-deck tournaments, he is second best and has already given us a 
		present, a Daruma, a Japanese good luck face mounted on board backing. 
		He is also going to send some Japanese records home for us. He is so 
		anxious to make friends and we fill that bill exactly.<br><br>Our ship 
		will stop at Aden in the middle of the night, so we won’t have time to 
		see much. We will send both of our suitcases to London by NYK and will 
		probably have to have the American Express take charge of them there. As 
		to whether we will buy bikes in Marseilles, we still don’t know. The 
		plan is to go along the Riviera to Genoa, and then by train the rest of 
		the way in Italy. All will depend on train fares. We are doing our 
		studying every day. I am still trying to decipher “Pictorial 
		Composition” for the second time. You can tell Virgil that he must think 
		I want to be a master of art right off the bat. Richard Halliburton is 
		the biggest liar in history and “So You Are Going to Italy” is for the 
		birds. It would take us a year to see all that he describes in Rome 
		alone.<br><br>This letter will be mailed in Marsailles as our boat will 
		arrive there sooner than the next mail boat. If there is anyone we have 
		missed writing to please let us know. So far we have sent a paltry 100 
		letters and the same number of postcards. I don’t know whom we can have 
		missed. Hope all still well D<br><br><br>APRIL 2 SUWA...Aden<br><br><br>
		<br>It has been a good voyage from Hong Kong to our present position in 
		the Red Sea. Perfect weather and affable companions of course make for 
		the best trip. it has been quite wonderful with breezes preventing real 
		heat. The sunsets have been very effective, but nothing like what we had 
		expected. Lately the moonlight nights have been special and Dick and I 
		have been tempted to just lie on the outside and look up at the stars. 
		It is fortunate that no one is around to take offense. Today we had a 
		race with some big porpoises evidently playing hooky from their schools. 
		When there are movies on the afterdeck, we sit on the top deck and take 
		it all in. We have seen a few good pictures among the majority of 
		mediocers. The only thing that detracts from the entertainment is an 
		occasional falling star or phosphorescent flashes in the sea. Although 
		we do a lot of reading and writing, we find time for the deck games. 
		Swimming is done on a small scale because in the canvas pool one can’t 
		dive from one end without taking a chance of hitting the other end. It 
		seems to be an odd English custom to daily have sweepstakes as chances 
		on the races in England. Dick and i took a chance on the Grand National 
		but our horses must have taken headers over the first hurdle.<br><br>
		Meal time is a happy time and at our table of 6 or 7 depending on the 
		fancies of the Second Purser Isamu Ikeda, who comes when he wishes. Mrs. 
		Hill from Kandy on Ceylon, the Shellams, and Mrs. Day from Calcutta are 
		our tablemates. We seemed to have created a fad when we ask for iced 
		tea. It was new at first and is now asked for by all. Our table steward 
		is excellent with only two words in his vocabulary. The are, “Yes Sir” 
		and “Sorry”. But what he lacks in vocabulary he makes up for in 
		exercise, for he is ever on the move. We have had many discussions about 
		Rotary with Mr. Shellam and Mr. Blackburn who argue that for years such 
		a thing as Rotary has been existing in the form of the ACAB. or Ancient 
		Order of Buffaloes. It sounds silly, and maybe it is. I have learned a 
		great deal from Mr. Shellam and will learn more. Dick has read five or 
		six books and I have read four. It is easy to read about what lies ahead 
		for us.<br><br>In order to male things clear I shall describe a day on 
		board the ship. At 7 AM there is tea and toast, with breakfast at 7:45 
		after a few turns on deck. We write or read to 10;30 when we go out for 
		a sun bath. Lunch is at 11:45 followed by a game of deck golf until 1 
		PM, and then we take an hour’s nap. another sun bath, a swim and a 
		shower. We write or read until sunset, and then have dinner, after which 
		are movies, dancing, deck games, or just sitting in deck chairs enjoying 
		the breezes. There is nothing dressy about second class, though all are 
		neat. Every now and then Dick and I may be dragged off to a corner to 
		look at photos by one of the Japanese photo enthusiasts. Every snapshot 
		is of himself, alone or with a relative-kind of boring at best. The 
		reason seems to be that that the Japanese want to build up their 
		confidence , but whatever it is, it will never seem normal to us.<br>
		<br>There are ten different nationalities in tourist class. They are 
		Belgian, American, Dutch, Japanese, Chinese, Siamese, Indian,, French, 
		German, and Singhalese. And we get along well. English is the universal 
		language as well.<br><br>One short midnight excursion into a suburb of 
		Aden was rewarding. Late in the afternoon land was sighted and about ten 
		we steamed into the Aden harbor. Two battleships were holding target 
		practice out in the ocean and it looked like the Fourth of July. We 
		finally dropped anchor opposite a British cruiser but all we could see 
		on shore was the dim outline of hills in the moonlight and the tinkling 
		of lights in clusters below. After landing by launch we walked into the 
		small community about five miles this side of Aden. Taxi drivers in new 
		Fords harassed us continually with offers to take us riding for prices 
		we were not prepared to pay. None rode, much to the disappointment of 
		the impolite drivers. Because there is a tariff only on alcohol and 
		ammunition it is considered a Free Port. Thus, many curios were bought 
		by the passengers.<br><br>Nothing enticed us so with Mr. Blackburn we 
		decided to explore, first going down a narrow street to glimpse the 
		inhabitants still awake. The only illumination was an occasional gas 
		lamp on an outside table. Goats were sleeping against the dirty walls 
		and crude beds lined the street, seeming to be occupied by someone 
		beneath a yellow sheet. The whitewashed and dusty buildings were one 
		story.<br><br>We walked up the street just wide enough for the 
		ever-0present taxi to follow. On one corner that seemed to be the center 
		of the community, eight Arabs were sitting around a table lit by a gas 
		lamp and covered with cups and saucers. They are for coffee, we learned, 
		for it is the custom to drink coffee no matter the hours. At the end of 
		this street was the marketplace, surrounded by a high wall, and beyond 
		this was the city well powered by human effort all through the days and 
		nights. Water is extremely scarce for it rains just once in seven years 
		in this dreary place. Food ws being sold nearby. On one table we saw a 
		variety of foods that appeared anything but appetizing. All of this time 
		we were followed by an Arab. Was he a guard or a guide? Maybe he 
		expected a fee, but we didn’t try to find out. A refreshing drink at one 
		of the hotels, a brisk walk along the seashore in the moonlight, with 
		the ships riding at anchor in the distance and then the short trip by 
		launch to our ship ended the evening’s explorations.<br><br>We are going 
		to Cairo from Suez and know exactly what we wish to see, hoping that 
		some one at Suez will meet us and make such a trip possible. T .<br><br>
		<br><br>April 7 Suwa Maru <br><br>We happily received Dad’s letter in 
		Port Said through Mr. Allen the Rotary President. It was the first news 
		since Hong Kong, so we read and reread. It is great that you are all 
		well and Stanford is coming through.<br><br>As Dick explained the trip 
		to Cairo seemed so impractical that we shall save it for a future time. 
		The Suez Canal was interesting, and we arrived in Port Said at midnight 
		on the 5th, Palm Sunday. We had gone to bed early anticipating the 
		coming day but about three AM we were awakened by loud yelling and a 
		commotion outside. Curiosity aroused I went outside. Our boat is a coal 
		burner and were taking on coal but in such a primitive manner. It 
		reminded me of a beehive. Everything was businesslike. The strong Arab 
		workers would have their baskets heaped full with coal, then lift the 
		heavy load to their shoulders and take their places in line on the 
		gangplank leading into the ship’s hold. When the basket was emptied, 
		down the second gangplank they would hurry, all of the time yelling in 
		high voices, possibly believing that in this way their burdens were 
		lightened. From the coal barge a few gas lamps added to the effect by 
		making the workers stand out in contrast to their own deep shadows. The 
		rest of the night was pleasantly spent dreaming about it.<br><br>Before 
		breakfast Dick and I went ashore and had our first look at the Middle 
		East. The Quay is the name of the waterfront street facing the Canal. At 
		the north end stands the statue of Ferdinand de Lessups, builder of the 
		Canal and the man who struck the first blow with his pick April 23rd, 
		1889. Thus was begun the town of Port Said. It was named in honor of 
		Mohammed Said, then Viceroy of Egypt. Beyond the statue is a breakwater 
		that runs more than three miles. And along the breakwater are the 
		fishing boats and as fascinating a group of fisherman as one cold hope 
		to see. One group was landing a cargo of freshly caught crabs. Some were 
		laying out there nets to dry. Others mended nets in the early sunshine.<br>
		<br>One boat was hoisting sail in preparation for the day’s work. 
		Everything was peaceful and after a few shots we hurried back to 
		breakfast on the ship.<br><br>Mr. Allen came in after breakfast and we 
		hustled into his car for a look at the town. Port Said is the gateway 
		between East and West, with a population of 100,000. The town is raised 
		above sea level to prevent damage from floods, and during the last five 
		years improvements have been many. Along the main street are the banks, 
		shops, and open aired cafes bordered by broad sidewalks. A French 
		atmosphere prevails as the formally dressed waiters try to drag you into 
		their cafes.<br><br>We drove outside the city and along the Canal for 
		several miles. We were show the broad body of water to the east of the 
		Canal which was formed by the Allies in the Great War to keep the Turks 
		from attacking with a land force. Along the Canal were heavily loaded 
		Egyptian boats that were being dragged along by men on the banks. From a 
		distance the tall white sails towered above the reeds along the shore, 
		which hid the squat flat boat itself from view.<br><br>Back to the city 
		then and a short ride through Arab quarters. Filth was the word that 
		every glimpse conveyed to us. The women dressed in long black dresses, 
		veiled and with a black cloth around their heads. If there is a gold bar 
		or pin on the forehead, the woman is married. The man’s garb consisted 
		of a couple of nightshirts, on over the other, with a fez or turban 
		above. A belt or band around the waist was common, and feet were bare.<br>
		<br>After you've seen a main street you have seen all of them, so we 
		hurried on to the Mosque where we alighted and entered with a guide. 
		Instead of removing shoes, we were given a woven reed cone to step feet 
		into. It was awkward but served the purpose. The exterior was not 
		impressive, but the inside was colorful and ornate. The paneled ceiling 
		painted in gaudy colors was supported by marble pillars that rose from 
		the stone floor. Geometric designs cover floor and walls in a decorative 
		manner and on the side against the wall facing Mecca, stood a wooden 
		throne used by the priest for his sermons. On either side were 
		Mohammedans kneeling in prayer and facing Mecca. In one corner was a 
		staircase leading up to a platform for the ladies to pray on. In an 
		adjoining building believers were washing hands and faces from water 
		taps on the wall. This is the procedure before worship. The priest-guide 
		showed us the Koran written in three languages<br><br>We were soon out 
		and on our way to Mr.Allen’s office and home. It is as large three story 
		building with offices on the first two floors, and home on top, and he 
		and Mrs. Allen showed us there beautifully appointed home. In the 
		garden, Mr.Allen cultivates roses as a hobby and there are always roses 
		to beautify his home. What he does with the roses is this. The Egyptian 
		rose is poor, so he buys English and French varieties and when the bush 
		has reached a certain stage of development, he extracts only a bud from 
		the foreign species and after splitting the side of the local shoot, he 
		grafts as he ties the bud tightly in the shoot. In this way he has a 
		rose of quality that otherwise could not have made it.<br><br>We were 
		served a grand lunch by Abdul, and then walked through the town and 
		window- shopped. Kodak stores were everywhere and since there is no duty 
		on imports, many of the passengers bought cameras at fine prices. Tea at 
		the Allens was very informal as Mrs.Allen was having a tennis party and 
		everyone was having a good time. We thanked the Allens and then returned 
		to the ship for dinner. Then we walked into town, had a beer in a 
		sidewalk cafe, a lesson in perfumes in one shop, and we were back on 
		board and leaving as the lights of Post Said dimmed in the distance.<br>
		<br>This morning we are passing the Island of Crete and it is hard to 
		realize that we are in the Mediterranean. We shall land either on Easter 
		or the day after. This would allow us to perhaps attend Easter Service 
		in the Notre Dame Cathedral in Marseilles. We have many problems that 
		will be solved when we get there. There are questions as to clothes, 
		bikes, money, hotel accommodations, etc. In any case we shall plan to 
		get started early on this first day of our journey abroad. We have 
		written to American Express in Naples asking them to forward mail to 
		Rome. A good deal of time has been spent writing letters to those who 
		have been so hospitable to us. It is getting cooler all the time, but 
		the weather should be good for the rest of the trip T<br><br><br><br>
		<br><br>April 13 Marseilles on Ship`<br><br><br><br>Yesterday, Easter 
		Sunday, was a very busy day. We awoke early and went on deck to find 
		Marseilles awakening under a slowly rising sun. To our left, as we 
		approached, was the main harbor, a barren promontory suggesting the 
		African arid coastlines. Halfway down to the shore a train crawled over 
		Roman arched bridges and through short tunnels. Further on were 
		factories, quiet on this holiday, and then came the outskirts of the 
		city and we could hear the bells ringing clear in the distance, 
		welcoming the Easter morn. We crossed to the other side of the ship and 
		there in the the distance was the little island of note, Monte Christo, 
		with the Chateau d’IF perched on top. Directly eastward lay the city of 
		Marseilles. A light blue haze hung over it, veiling its buildings and 
		streets. But high on the hill to the north stands the Cathedral de la 
		Garde, or Sailors’ Cathedral, with early morning sunshine bathing its 
		bell tower.<br><br>As we drew near to the protective breakwater, small 
		fishing boats around us were drawing in their nets. The air was crimpy, 
		and a north wind intensified it, to an uncomfortable degree.<br><br>Our 
		ship finally docked and we were expecting the American Consul to meet 
		us. There was a man standing on the dock and Dick and another traveler 
		were standing at the rail. The man waved and Dick waved back, and so did 
		the Doctor. The man motioned that he was coming aboard so Dick and I 
		went forward to meet him. thinking it the American Consul. But then the 
		doctor put in that he thought this was his friend, whom he was expecting 
		though had never before seen. We decided to go forward together and wait 
		at the gangway, and the one he went for would be the person he had come 
		to meet. We stood there with such blank looks on our faces I am sure, if 
		he had been the Consul he wouldn’t have recognized us. But instead he 
		shook hands with the doctor, and we had a good laugh over the 
		predicament and its outcome.<br><br>We had our passports OK’d by the 
		French officials in the smoking room, and as we were walking out, one 
		fellow said to us, “Have you gotten your money changed?” “We haven’t any 
		money” we replied and we both had to laugh. Not five steps further, a 
		travel agency man inquired ”Have you purchased your railroad tickets 
		yet?”: “No, we’re riding bicycles” we replied and left him without any 
		business.<br><br>We had breakfast and waited for the Consul who had 
		wired the ship that he would meet it. At ten, a man arrived and said he 
		had been sent to see that we were fixed up, but he appeared to be such a 
		poor means of information and such a poor representative of any Consul 
		that we thanked for his trouble and started to look over the city with 
		our Japanese friend, the Second Purser.<br><br>During he next five hours 
		or so in Marseilles, we walked and saw a great deal. We climbed to the 
		Cathedral Notre Dame de La Garde, which provides a magnificent view of 
		the city and all about it. The clouds were wonderful and the ocean 
		stretched out to the horizon a rich deep blue. The Isle of Monte Christo 
		and a larger island adjoining it seemed very near to shore from our 
		point of vantage, and the city itself was a solid mass of streets and 
		roofs. We were taking in all of this beauty when 12 o’clock arrived and 
		from all of the city the bells chimed. Yes, it was thrilling. Our 
		Cathedral bells rang loudest of all, like a father church dominating all 
		blow. We stepped out of the wind into the shelter of an elaborate chapel 
		just take a breath and let the beauties we were seeing sink in.<br><br>
		From the Cathedral we descended through cobbled ureters to the “Old 
		Port” which is the inner body of water that shelters only the small 
		boats, but which in the past was the main port. Guarding it is the 
		historical Fort St. Jean erected on the site of a house which in the 
		twelfth century was the rest house for pilgrims to the Holy Land. We 
		walked up through the city by way of the main street and the spot where 
		Alexander of Yugoslavia and Barthou of France were shot, to the Palais 
		Longchamp. On the way we stopped at a patisserie which had an enticing 
		window display of Easter candy, and purchased some rolls for lunch. The 
		pretty waitress spoke so fast in French, and not sympathetic to our 
		plight, made us wonder what our two years of high school french had 
		produced. Finally, we just talked in numbers and prices and got what we 
		needed.<br><br>The Palais Longchamp dates from 1860 and contains a 
		museum and art gallery of note. From there we visited the “Porte d’Aix”, 
		a triumphal arch inaugurated in 1883. We visited the Cathedral said to 
		be the most beautiful building constructed in the city since the 
		sixteenth century. Services were going on so we stayed for a few minutes 
		in he restful atmosphere. Outside, men and boys were playing a game 
		where brass balls are rolled along the ground just as we play marbles. 
		On the side of the buildings are the words in small letters ”Defense 
		d’Afficher” which means “No Bills”, so we are picking up our language 
		capabilities. The women unmercifully paint their lips and they seem to 
		drag their male escorts by the arm, all the time talking a blue streak. 
		The men wear berets, and we have seen some very effeminate males.<br>
		<br>Returning to the boat for dinner we stayed on board for the night. 
		This morning we got up, had tea. and said “Goodbye” and watched the ship 
		pull away, our friends waving from the stern. From our Hand Me Down we 
		found this small hotel and it seems to be a good choice, because the 
		price is 35 francs plus tax and tips, 40 francs inclusive, for room and 
		board. The exchange rate is 15 francs per dollar, and the bill runs per 
		person about $2.66 per day. This is probably a standard price. One 
		problem is that since Monday is also a holiday banks are closed so we 
		had to borrow from our good friend Mr. Shellam who was only too glad to 
		help us, Dad, because you are a Mason.<br><br>Tomorrow we receive letter 
		when American Express opens. Also, we shall buy our bikes and equipment, 
		and we’ll probably start riding on Wednesday, about noon, for Toulon and 
		our first day on the road.<br><br>We have just had our first French 
		lunch and it was delightfully prepared and delicious, especially the 
		fluffy French bread which comes in rolls a yard long. Today is dreary 
		because of the poor weather, such a contrast to sunny yesterday. Dick 
		will write tomorrow. Yesterday we were a bit discouraged, perhaps 
		homesick, but today we feel better..Ted April 15 Marseilles..<br><br>
		Today is our fourth in Marseilles as we prepare for our pedal trip A 
		little sunshine and a few friends make a difference in these times of 
		change. For the first time since leaving home, we were depressed. We 
		were so alone on Easter holidays in a foreign land where communication 
		is a struggle, especially when banks are closed and pockets empty.<br>
		<br>Having arrived on Sunday, we stayed on board, most of the time in 
		our room, writing letters. An overcast day did not beckon. The Consulate 
		representative sent to meet us was so odious that we said, “Thank you. 
		We will get along”. We gathered that the man assigned to meet us did it 
		grudgingly. We therefore chose to go it alone and wait for Tuesday when 
		the holidays were over. We hoped Rotary would take us on board. And it 
		did, of course<br><br>After several calls, we found the Rotary 
		Corresponding Secretary, a charming French girl who got in touch with a 
		few Rotarians conversant in English. And we had our first chance to 
		speak our high school French to someone who courteously helped us. We 
		improved with each phrase. She then took us to the American Consulate. 
		It was refreshing to be heartily greeted by the Consul General. And, 
		there, with our needs clearly defined in English, our plans were formed 
		and stores found where we could purchase bikes and knapsacks. We wished 
		to be on our way tomorrow to Toulon. We missed the Rotary meeting. It 
		was probably just as well, for coats and ties are terribly expensive, 
		and I doubt our sweaters would have been warmly accepted.<br><br>And as 
		for bikes- they are very expensive at $30 apiece, as compared to England 
		and Germany. They are light racing style, with turned down bars, gears, 
		and hand brakes which we will have to master after being raised on 
		coaster brakes.<br><br>It was sure great to receive your many ureters 
		yesterday, including some from Miss Maiden, Midge Roth, and Dorothy 
		Shields. We are so happy to know that all is well at home We had no idea 
		our letters would cause such a stir. As to the future, we will do our 
		best to daily keep up, but our letters will have to be more concise. We 
		are saddened about Everett Brown’s illness. What a wonderful neighbor, 
		and so young.<br><br>As you suggest, in many of the larger cities we 
		will contact the club president, if only to say hello. Please send us 
		copies of the letters to the Presidents so we know what to do in each 
		city. Please contact them at Zurich, Nurenburg, Munich. Berlin, Cologne, 
		Copenhagen and Amsterdam. We will be happy to stop over with the Glovers 
		in Chicago as we come home.<br><br>As for moving and storing methods 
		like Lyon, today we will wander through the waterfront warehouses to see 
		what goes. I will send a can of six or eight films home today. They are 
		catalogued. I suggest that you print in strips. It is best to have 
		Eastman do it. Don’t expect to see much detail in the small prints. I 
		will blow them up on our return. If prints are made, please keep the 
		rolls intact so as not to disturb the sequences.<br><br>Our suitcases 
		are going on to London on the ship, to await us there. Did you receive 
		our airmail letter about documents referring to the suitcases? That’s 
		super about Bruce becoming a Patrol leader. As for Stanford winning the 
		title, it is as expected. As for the Olympics- if they are going to 
		allow the semi-pos to take over, the truly great amateur players such as 
		Hank are unlikely to make the team. So sad.<br><br>If any friends feel 
		slighted on not receiving letters, please see what you can do with our 
		letters to you. We’ve done our best to thank everyone, even Mrs. Andrews 
		who sent $10, bless her. As of now we have sent at least a hindered 
		cards and letters - a real workout to try and please everybody.<br><br>
		Bruce, your pictures are coming along well. However I think you are 
		giving them too much light and forcing you to take them out od the 
		developer too soon. Or you may be leaving them in the developer too 
		long, making them smudgy and brown. Use the printer, red light on all of 
		the time, and give the negative about one second of light. Be careful 
		not to get acid on the negatives. If this happens, wash them off 
		immediately and hang them up to dry with a clothes pin. Wash all prints 
		afterward, about six changes per hour. Keep all of the negatives 
		together. We love seeing your pictures. keep at it and send them and I 
		will criticize. We will be anxious to hear from all of you in Rome and 
		Geneva. You can send Air Mail to Zurich now. <br><br>The bubbling city 
		of Marseilles is our introduction to France, and to Europe, with so much 
		still ahead. It was not until yesterday that we caught the elevating 
		spirit of activity going on all about us, announced by voice, engine, 
		signboard, horn, and even chains on wheels rattling over damp 
		cobblestones after a night’s rain . Early in the morning, men bend to 
		their tasks, and only evening allows them to return home to their wine 
		and bread, an institution here.<br><br>Our pension is four streets away 
		from the waterfront, looking out over a narrow dark cobblestone street 
		to the base of a steep hill to the south on which is the seaman’s 
		cathedral, Notre Dame de la Garde. It is filled with votive offerings 
		from thankful sailors and fishermen. As I open our shutters each morning 
		and let Old Man Sunshine in, I am reminded of the musical street and 
		Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette McDonald where all was rhythm as each 
		vendor added horn, voice, or hammer to the song. Great trucks loaded to 
		the gunwale speed by with open mufflers. Horses’ hooves, clickity- 
		clacking on the rounded stones give us a glimpse into a disappearing 
		age. The squeaking of horns and the ringing of church bells gives a 
		musical, if not always harmonious, touch to the street opera below. As 
		the working hour of nine approaches, groups of plainly dressed girls and 
		beret-topped men move jauntily down the street, and more briskly as as 
		the hour grows late. On the corner below, the neighborhood flower woman 
		sets up her stand to show her brightly colored and cheery wares. Green 
		shutters to the right, red shutters to the left and brown shutters in 
		front of us are open to welcome the warming sun. As we look over the 
		numberless tiled roofs and chimneys of the closely packed buildings, 
		Notre De La Garde strands out in stark beauty, appearing as a great hand 
		with its index finger, gold tipped and shining brightly against the blue 
		sky, pointing ever up at the guiding way to a great beyond.<br><br>At 
		7:15 when everything is in full swing and we can no longer sleep, Ted 
		and I go town to a breakfast of tea and buns-French bread of course. 
		There we discuss our intentions for the day and make plans. Lunch and 
		dinner are always accompanied by plates of French bread, which we 
		consume by the yard, a little Vichy water to wash it down. We make the 
		best of questions put to us by our waitress in rapid French and we 
		attempt to give answers. We receive a smile for our efforts. From the 
		Piedmont blackboard to conversation is a big step and we are getting 
		there. Just give us a few years in France and we will make it.<br><br>
		Out on the street we pause to comment on what is going on about us. One 
		of the first things to strike our attention is the painted faces going 
		by on all sides. Ruby red lips are the rule here, while makeup is used 
		to such a degree that one might take the ladies to be wax models from a 
		department store window. All of the “jeune fillies” hang on their 
		escorts arms and rattle sweet nothings into their boy friend's ears. In 
		some cases we had a difficult time determining which was the boy, 
		because of the foppish dress, feminine appearance and actions of the 
		supposed male.<br><br>Lame and legless men pass by by all day. Certainly 
		France has not forgotten 1914 with these reminders. The beret seems to 
		be the national hat here and we must admit that it is apropos, for the 
		windy weather on the hilltops, as at Notre Dame de La Garde. is best 
		served by a hat that will stay in place.<br><br>Pastry shops(patisserie) 
		line every street, their windows filled with tantalizing goodies, great 
		chocolate Easter eggs, and guess what, French bread. How strange.<br>
		<br>Flower shops on the corners, wIth their buxom women vendors, add 
		color and beauty to each street. for a French street is bare without 
		these touches of nature’s jewels.<br><br>While we stand and admire the 
		scenes around us, traffic whizzes by at a terrific rate. Low, underslung 
		autos with mufflers wide open drive down the streets as if all were 
		one-way, passing street cars and trucks on the wrong side. Cyclists zip 
		about like blood hounds, their noses to the ground, all racers bent low 
		to grab their handlebars. If we were to travel in this manner, our 
		observations would be limited to descriptions of the the pavements 
		below.<br><br>Everything is priced exorbitantly here. We must drink 
		bottled water. It is dangerous to walk narrow streets at night. What a 
		contrast are we. We are two flagpoles covered with red and blue 
		sweaters. All speak French faster than I could speak English. We ask 
		them to “Parley vous lentament”, but with a few more words. things are 
		again out of control. Marseilles is a city of hustle and bustle, far 
		more so than any place we have known. We find the people temperamental 
		and quick to act, perhaps accounting for some of their troubles in 
		Europe.<br><br>This experience of a few days is only an introduction to 
		a different way of life, as we scratch the surface, Tomorrow we hope 
		that we will be on our bikes and we will be on our way along the Riviera 
		to Italy. We are not going to hurry. Our friends and adventures in the 
		East have taught us this lesson<br><br>We must now be off on our way to 
		the Consulate and to purchase bikes. Tomorrow we will be on the open 
		road. Our next note will be from Toulon. 1936 Letter 2 TED Grand Rubie 
		Hotel, Marseilles, April 15,1936.<br><br><br><br>We were very happy to 
		get your letters at American Express with welcome news from home. Things 
		seem to fine with all of you, and we are so glad. Yesterday, after 
		reading the precious letters, we decided to make the short trip to the 
		Chateau D’If. For five francs(50 cents) we boarded a large tugboat that 
		moved slowly to the “old fort” . It was a beautiful afternoon, with 
		white billowy clouds overhead and with enough sun shining through, ”to 
		make a man a pair of pants”, in Mom’s words.<br><br>First we passed the 
		old Town Hall that marks the edge of the t Old City; then small sailing 
		sloops, and finally the historic Fort St. Jean which stands at the 
		port’s entrance. Because the structure has no military importance, it is 
		simply of historic interest to visitors to Marseilles. The Cathedral 
		Notre Dame de la Garde is impressive as it stands out against the white 
		clouds. Our gaze always starts from there as the foreground changes, 
		sometimes framing it, but ever to increase its inspiring effects. The 
		Chateau is about a mile from shore. As we plunged through a fairly rough 
		sea, a wave hit directly and the people in the bow took a bath or two. 
		One lady went aft to try and shake the water out of her furs, hat, and 
		shoes. She was drenched. A proud sailing yacht passed us as we neared 
		the rough rock landing. then to climb the rough stairs to the prison.<br>
		<br>The structures on the island were built in 1534 for the defense of 
		Marseilles against the Spaniards. Afterwards it was used as a state 
		prison and it became notorious throughout the world in Alexander Dumas’ 
		novel, The “Count of Monte Cristo”. The prison stands on the highest 
		point of the island and appeared square and solid as we approached from 
		the front. We passed over the old wooden bridge and through a battered 
		wooden door to the ticket office. Just beyond was a small courtyard with 
		the inevitable well in its center. Our gaze next was caught by the small 
		white signs over each doorway. These designated the various cells and 
		their prisoners. A guide, candle in hand and speaking in rapid French. 
		led the way to the cell of Edmund Dantes. It was tiny and dark. Sure 
		enough, there was the hole in the wall, just large enough to let a man 
		slide through. It was worn smooth by adventurous tourists, who, through 
		the centuries, had wormed their way through. We then entered the Abbey’s 
		room, still following the candlelight that made for us this experience 
		unique. The stone walls had no writing on them, for they had been 
		plastered and the floors tiled. Thus, what we saw was not there when 
		Edmund Dantes was the prisoner. The room was still damp, and cold-just 
		plain miserable. We could only wonder how anyone could have survived in 
		such an environment.<br><br>As we climbed the stairway to the second 
		floor, we examined the walls more closely. Although surfaced by pieces 
		of brick and stone here and there, they were solid with sandstone, 
		limestone, and a conglomeration of fossilized sea matter. On the second 
		floor were the cells of the more influential prisoners, much larger than 
		those of Dantes and the Abbey. Instead of a low doorway and steps 
		leading down into the cell, entryways were large and the cell large 
		enough to suggest some comfort. The white sign over the first cell read, 
		“Premier Prison Abbe Perette, Abbe Demarares”. The second doorway read 
		“Deuxieme Prison, Marquis de Lavalette”. The next cell was the prison of 
		“L’homme en Masque de Fer”, The man in the iron mask, of course. Louis 
		Phillipe de Orleans and others, equally prominent as suggested by their 
		door signs and implying a little comfort.<br><br>The cells were on the 
		whole the same, with cold sandstone floors, windows barred with iron, 
		and domed stone ceilings. In some were crude chimneys evidently for fire 
		places. Around all were wooden prongs in the walls jutting out at six 
		feet above the floor. Chains and small crude tables hung from some and 
		we imagined that they their as constant reminders that they would be 
		restraints for beatings and torture, perhaps at the whim of a guard. 
		Sunshine, as it passed through a barred window, made a square of light 
		on the stone floors. It was easy to to imagine the figure of a man, 
		silhouetted, as he grasped the bars and hopelessly looked at the barren 
		yard outside. <br><br>A winding staircase then took us to the top and to 
		the uppermost parapet where a colorful panorama of sea and city 
		unfolded. Just below us was likely the point d from which Dantes was 
		thrown as a corpse into the sea, only to recover and swim to an 
		adjoining island.<br><br>We went back down along dark corridors and past 
		many more cells with gruesome histories and finally through the dungeon 
		threshold to he outside, and what must have been a blessed freedom to 
		some. We moved quickly, for the launch was whistling for our escape. 
		Soon we were chugging back to the City, Edmund Dantes deeply tugging at 
		our imaginations. We sailed close off shore by the famous Promenade de 
		la Corniche. It is bordered by sumptuous villas, gorgeous ordered 
		gardens, and miniature forts, leading to the Old Port. What a day of 
		surprises and perhaps just the beginning of unforgettable experiences 
		ahead,<br><br>Today, we hope to purchase bicycles. A Rotarian will helps 
		us. The prices will be dear, but we will likely satisfy our perceived 
		needs. We are still getting our bearings and clearing our minds for what 
		lies ahead. Each decision will be guided by the wisdom you have 
		bequeathed to us. The next letter will likely be from Toulon of 
		the16th., my first birthday away from home. On this first day out on the 
		road, may it be a fine one. Riviera, here we come. With lots of love to 
		all. Ted # 3 April 19 Hotel Bristol Toulon<br><br><br><br>After many 
		days of preparation and anticipation, we started our bicycle trip. We 
		left Marseilles at 8;50 after a breakfast of French bread and Ceylon 
		tea. Our bikes, as you see in the pictures, are well loaded with baggage 
		and contraptions. We left Marseilles on cobblestone streets, cars and 
		busses tooting horns to announce that they were behind or passing us. 
		The gears worked smoothly and the bikes fairly hummed. If it weren’t for 
		those blessed cobblestones, everything would be hunkey-dorey. My fanny 
		has not yet toughened up-should I say “adjusted” and is sore at this 
		moment. The fields on either side of the roads remind us of pictures we 
		have seen of the French countryside.<br><br>In the distance and standing 
		high on the crest of a hill and partially surrounded by tall trees was a 
		magnificent chateau, towers in the sky. It was just a fleeting glimpse 
		at best as we moved along. After passing through a small town, Aubagne, 
		we turned toward the coast and started climbing the low range of hills 
		which shelter the valley we had just traversed. Climbing was tough, and 
		several times we had to dismount and push. But on reaching the top, we 
		felt or first pride as we passed our first test, legs just beginning to 
		adjust. At the summit we had our first roadside meal- the French bread 
		left over from breakfast.<br><br>The ride down was great. How we loved 
		it! We zipped along in racing position. The road smooth and well 
		engineered so that curves could be a joy to speed around. At the bottom, 
		we had our first real look at a Riviera village. The shore was very 
		beautiful with its rugged points of land and low waves pounding over 
		invisible reefs. Alpng the coast we pedaled over meandering hills and 
		dales and saw our first cypress trees hanging over the ocean as at home 
		in Carmel. Soon we were among pines, elms, and canyon live oaks.<br><br>
		There seemed to be a great deal of house construction, apparently summer 
		homes for the affluent. Every so often, we stopped to examine our map to 
		be sure we were on course, or snap a picture or two for the countryside 
		was green green. We passed quite a few cyclers, and had fun trying out 
		our French by asking directions from farmers as they leaned over their 
		fences.<br><br>At about one o’clock, we coasted along the narrow main 
		street of a seaside village, stopping at the pastry shop before quaffing 
		a beer at a roadside table. It was a real thrill to revel in what our 
		first day portended as we absorb the quaintness of this other world. 
		Sure wish you could be here too, for there is plenty of new beauty to go 
		around.<br><br>Take it away Dick....Love Ted, April 16 Marseilles dick<br>
		<br><br><br>The trip from Port Said was particularly interesting for 
		several reasons. Early on the morning of the eleventh our ship 
		approached Stromboli, great volcano, looming up out of the sea. We were 
		fortunate in that our Captain took the ship closer to the volcano than 
		it had ever been before, giving us a marvelous view of the white and 
		blue smoke issuing forth, accompanied by a deep rumbling which is heard 
		for miles With field glasses we could see sheets of flame. The strange 
		thing about all this is that we couldn’t smell the sulfurous gases 
		always found near Stromboli.<br><br>Along the bases of the slopes are 
		petite white-walled fishing towns nestled several miles along each side 
		of the gigantic lava flow that runs from the foaming mouth to the sea. 
		This volcano is the type that does not explode. Its crater is always 
		open and a slow movement of lava constantly issues over the lower side 
		of the vent. People living in the fishing villages are safe. Auto 
		traffic is unknown. Our view of Stomboli we will always treasure for it 
		is seldom that one sails so close and on the crater’s open As sunset 
		approached we passed through the straits of Bonifcio between Corsica and 
		Sardinia. Here we had a thrill. At one [point in the passage we passed 
		the Suwa's sister ship, the Kashima Maru wish much whistling and flag 
		flying. A few minutes a m medium sized orange amphibian flying between 
		Sardinia and Marseilles swooped<br><br>d low to salute us it winged its 
		way to France, all climaxed by a gorgeous sunset in the west.<br><br>
		<br><br>THURSDAY APRIL 16<br><br><br><br>Much to our disappointment, for 
		we had planned to leave this morning for Toulon, the day turned stormy 
		wet, water showering and turning cobblestones into rivers of slippery 
		rocks rounded by wagon wheels. It was too wet to venture out so we spent 
		most of Le Matin in our room writing cards and letters to friends in the 
		Orient. At 11:30 we sneaked out between showers and hurried down to the 
		American Express to change some of our accumulated money into the more 
		practical travelers cheques. We figure it is safer to pay a few francs 
		more for the insurance that cash does not provide. On our return, rain 
		again began to fall -two red and blue sweatered kids hurrying along 
		through the crowds of the smaller French shoppers. The truth really is 
		that these are not French at all. They’re Italians and Spaniards for the 
		most part. Marseilles is the Chicago of France. over run with 
		foreigners. There are only 20 or so Americans in this city of 660,000, 
		and I’ll bet they all ride in taxis rather than risk their lives trying 
		to drive in this hair raising traffic with no regulations whatsoever. 
		Just try to outguess the other fellow and if it’s a tie. tough luck.<br>
		<br>In our ambling we pass hundreds of patisseries, their windows loaded 
		with delicious pastries and with the equally delicious scent of freshly 
		baked goodies and french bread wafting out over the street. Marseilles 
		should also be famous for its neat modern “boucheries”, with their wares 
		so tastefully displayed that they look edable in the raw. As we walked 
		through one of the city’s many green mantled squares, shaded by immense 
		poplars old man sun finally managed a peak from above, turning the 
		dripping water globules into strings of glistening light, Cafe 
		proprietors were hurriedly setting up their open air restaurants beneath 
		arched tree limbs, with small round tables with its<br><br>bottle of 
		carbonated water. At the corner of the parks, magazine stands did a 
		brisk business as tradesmen rushed out to get the news before another 
		downpour.<br><br><br><br>FRIDAY APRIL 17<br><br><br><br>Back at the Rubi 
		Hotel once more we sat down in the Salle a Manger and consumed 
		everything in sight, including plates of french bread washed down with a 
		mixture of water and Vin Ordinare, given us by a French aqauintance 
		sitting with us.<br><br>Since business closes from 12 to 2 each day, we 
		always have a few minutes to make use of and that means writing letters, 
		of course. Two o’clock found us striding down to the “Cycles Farer” 
		where our bikes were waiting, ready for us to pedal off, which we really 
		did after making certain adjustments and plunking down 652 francs. This 
		is $43 for the two bikes, complete, and we feel we have good metal under 
		us. Each “push bike” is equipped with two hand brakes, gears with three 
		speeds, a baggage rack, racing handles reversed and turned up, tire 
		pump, wrenches, and racing wheels. They are technically not “racers” but 
		are made for touring and are as light as our bikes at home. We are happy 
		with them. Both are black with fenders trimmed, brakes on both wheels, 
		toe clamps on pedals. and an extra inner tube.<br><br>In order to try 
		out our machines which will have to take us thousands of miles, we 
		pedaled for several miles along the Promenade de Corniche known to the 
		world-over for its beauty and its winds. It runs along the rugged shore, 
		roaring billowing waves on one side and magnificent gardens on the 
		other. The roadway here, as in the rest of Marseilles, is constructed of 
		rough irregular cobblestones, making riding difficult, especially when 
		one is bucking a fierce headwind, as was our luck. We don’t see how 
		these narrow rimmed small-tired wheels can stand the continuous jolting 
		on such roadways without warping and cracking. It is for this reason 
		that the wheels have metal rims They can warp all they want but had 
		better not break.<br><br>The ever changing shore line views from the 
		Corniche are spectacular. Monterey might offer some competition, but I 
		doubt if we ever may see any shore more beautiful. Precipitous cliffs 
		topped with magnificent villas continue for the entire length of the 
		Promenade. As we visited it, a gale was blowing, building up great waves 
		which crash with vigor on the rugged rock-strewn beach below us. To the 
		southwest Chateau d’If stood silhouetted, a black angular mediaeval 
		fortress rising from brilliant sun lit water.<br><br>I am sure our visit 
		to the Corniche came at the finest time, when the sea raged with all its 
		fury, leaving no doubt in our minds how the shoreline gained its 
		ruggedness. A late afternoon sun turned the turbulent waves into sheets 
		of gold, silhouetting jutting headlands, island strongholds, and hilltop 
		villages in the distance, all against the cloud blown blue sky.<br><br>
		If our photos turn out as we would hope these words will be frightfully 
		inadequate. Promenade de Corniche is our introduction to the French 
		Riviera, and they say “You ain't seen nothin yet”.<br><br>Returning to 
		the Rubi along the beautiful broad tree arbored Prade Boulevard before 
		dark we found plenty to do, while making plans for the next few days on 
		the Riviera. But we we could not start for another day , though, because 
		Ted complained of a little fever(100 degrees) which we promptly got 
		after. A light dinner of soup, Evian water, and string beans were 
		followed by a warm bed and two more bottles of Evian with an aspirin 
		before going to sleep.<br><br>Today everything is honkey dorey again. He 
		will spend the morning in bed, drinking more water, reading, and will 
		get up this afternoon. We had our usual petite dejeuner ce matin of tea 
		and rolls and will eat lightly today. We had planned to start yesterday 
		but just as well to delay. Tomorow we hope will dawn bright and clear so 
		that we finally will start.<br><br>These four days in Marseilles have 
		been good for us. They have given us time to become acclimated and to 
		get the feel of the European and French atmosphere. Two months in the 
		Orient has taught us not to hurry.<br><br>Today is clear and sunny but 
		the air is still cool from the days of rain. We hope things will warm up 
		for our long delayed venture tomorrow. Probably Hyeres, Toulon, or Le 
		Lavendu will be our first night’s stop. We understand that we can get an 
		$11 ticket through Italy from Genoa to Rome to Florence to Venice to 
		Milan, and to Switzerland. Looks like a gook buy. We will put our bikes 
		on the trains;<br><br>Yesterday we cashed out Letter of Credit for $92 
		and took out a Letter of Credit in the Italian Transit Bureau for 15000 
		lira, giving us 17 lira to the dollar rather than the 13 which regular 
		exchange gives. Luckily we hit it on the right day and received the best 
		exchange. We hope to make the money last through Italy. That extra $200 
		will take care of bikes and equipment and any clothes or presents we 
		would buy in England. Things are terribly cheap there and very good.<br>
		<br>Yesterday we sent a tin container with rolls of Contax film 
		registered to you. Sure hope they get through and will send in smaller 
		batches as we go. Right now we are carrying a dozen rolls purchased in 
		Port Said duty free, and these should take us to Germany where films are 
		again cheap.<br><br>Ted just took his temperature and it is sub normal 
		but he is breathing. He will stay in bed this morning and have lunch 
		downstairs. We will purchase some books of Italian grammar and Gothic 
		architecture. You see, it’s the extra little things like this that cost 
		money but are necessary for us to appreciate to the fullest what we see. 
		In Milan we will try to find the underground chime-ringer whom you love 
		to talk about, Dad.<br><br>Thank you for the clippings. We love to read 
		about what the boys are doing. What were the results of the A.C.A.L 
		Bruce? We are pleased, Mom, that you like the cloisone-so beautiful!, 
		and more so than other more expensive ones. Mr. Ando was very kind to 
		us.<br><br>Perhaps it is better that we did not land at Naples. 
		Yesterday we met a man in American Express who had just come from there 
		and Rome, and told us it was rain all the way. Please take a picture of 
		the house from Caperton and send it to us with several prints. People 
		constantly ask about our home.<br><br>A strange thing happened. A report 
		of us in the Tokyo Rotary Weekly was sent to Missouri and then because 
		we are Stanfords, the note reached Midge Roth. Funny how the word gets 
		around.<br><br>(Drawing)<br><br>This gives you an idea of how we look 
		riding about, sitting up with heads high and in the clouds. We have to 
		turn our bars up for being tall we practically have to stand on our 
		heads to reach the turned down bars in standard racing position.<br><br>
		<br><br>6PM<br><br>Ted’s temp has been normal all day and he feels fine, 
		so we will pray for good weather and personal top condition, and we will 
		be on our way. We spent most of the afternoon catching up on our 
		writing, and hope no one has been missed.<br><br>At about 3 PM I ambled 
		down Rue Pardis to La Carrahiere, Marseilles’ main drag, to inquire for 
		mail at American Express and make some purchases. The sun was shining 
		brightly and all of the big department stores had their displays on the 
		sidewalks. All attempts to purchase a safety chain and combination lock 
		for our bikes failed. We will try again in Toulon. Everything is all set 
		to leave. Our bill for bottled water will be probably high in francs, 
		but that is all part of the gae. We will probably be in Genoa about the 
		30th next month, so please write accordingly. Our plans are so fluid 
		that guessing ahead is pretty futile, but keep trying. # 4 TED Sunday, 
		April 20 at Le Lavendu<br><br><br><br>This, our second day on bicycles 
		has been an eventful one. This morning, before leaving, we washed 
		clothes, mended some, cleaned bikes, and wrote a bit. Dick went down to 
		the corner bar and got a refund on our beer bottles. We have been 
		clearly warned to stick to beer when in any doubt about the local water. 
		Thank goodness for our Asahi beer christening in Tokyo. Breakfast of hot 
		chocolate and buns was enjoyed at the food counter of Les Dames de 
		France, a big department store in Toulon.<br><br>Pardon the intrusion 
		into our saga, but as I sit here on the beach veranda of our lovely 
		pension, night is closing fast and just this moment several fishing boat 
		are putting out to sea. By the look of things, summer has made for an 
		unusual catch, and there is a rush to take advantage of it. It is 
		cooling off. but the sun has been with us for quite a time. It is 7”30 
		PM and back to the story.<br><br>As i was saying, we enjoyed our 
		breakfast in Toulon and were soon pedaling for Le Lavendu. We left town 
		through a district of large homes, or villas, perhaps the Piedmont of 
		this area. In the distance were the picturesque ruins of some old homes 
		and even a church. All were buried in vineyards, so colorful in the 
		early morning glow. In passing a farmhouse, we became more and more 
		aware of the brightly multicolored shutters which stand out even more 
		than window box flowers. A few tall trees border the vineyards. The road 
		was busy with horses and wagons, and every now and then a motorcycle or 
		bus would toot its horn and pass. As we approached the shore we noticed 
		that the hillsides rising from the beaches, were terraced for vegetables 
		and flowering plants There were many large homes overlooking the sea 
		surrounded by vineyards or expansive grounds. Each farm has some source 
		of water. There are many wells where the water is delivered by a 
		revolving gear turned by farm circling animals At the moment the wells 
		are still for recent rains have left the soil still moist.<br><br>After 
		passing though several villages, we reached Hyeres, the oldest of the 
		famed Riviera winter resorts, and well known for its flowers and early 
		fruit. We stopped at a beer parlor, for we are finding that thirst is a 
		byproduct of our cycling efforts. Behind the town and above the War 
		memorial slightly higher are perched the centuries old ruins of the 
		original town. This quiet scene reminded us of the European villages 
		fabricated for the Chicago Exposition we boys saw with Dad. A small 
		shopping street, entered beneath an arch off to the left. French 
		soldiers in their light blue uniforms stood in twos ant threes, or in 
		larger groups enjoying a beer. A policeman was directing traffic which 
		consisted almost entirely of tourists. And soon we were on our way 
		again, always pumping.<br><br>The next steep help was conquered as we 
		rode in low gear for we are making strides as muscles tone up. The coast 
		down to Le Lavendu was our reward. We are becoming seasoned cyclists. 
		The ride down, a long glide, ended in our destination, Le Lavendu.<br>
		<br>As we approached the town we overtook many people walking towards Le 
		Lavendu in their Sunday best. Evidently something special would take 
		place that afternoon. We hurried to a restaurant to have a quick lunch 
		and not miss anything. Then we riding again along narrow streets to the 
		city square that was bounded by a beach on one side, and beer verandahs 
		on the other three. No sooner had we arrived than from a side street 
		emerged the town band, blowing lustily. Behind were several old cars 
		decked with flowers. Then came the floats. in one, six pretty girls 
		tossed lilies and carnations to bystanders. This obviously was a day 
		dedicated to flowers, lilies in particular. An old wagon was decked out 
		in spring colors and even the old dray horse had colorful headpieces. 
		This happening was the last thing we expected to stumble on in a small 
		French town. When “The Tournament of Lilies” ended, the square was 
		filled as prizes were awarded and the band played for the dancers.<br>
		<br>Taking part as best we could, we paid too many of our few francs for 
		ice cream cones, and then climbed to a vantage point to gain a better 
		view of the town and take a photo or two, The hills were covered with 
		Scotch Broom and an unfamiliar purple flower. In small gardens a 
		everywhere were beds of lilies, roses, and carnations<br><br>Back to the 
		pension. A room was finally secured as we macerated the French language 
		from the French point of view. We must have been understood, for our 
		room faced the sea as we would have wished and breezes take us back to 
		Coronado. The bikes had to cleaned and overhauled, a daily routine. 
		Dinner consisted of some French pastry and a bar of chocolate, for our 
		late expensive lunch had taken the edge from an appetite. We are lucky 
		in our choice of pension, for hosts husband and wife are warm, and 
		charming. With sea air wafting in, sleep came quick and 
		sound.#5..LeLavend<br><br>u..Ted April; 21, 1936<br><br><br><br>Its 
		raining again. But as Dick keeps saying “It looks like it will clear 
		up”. I hope so. Dick is writing at the other end of the table in his red 
		sweater and with pen going like an express train. A delicious breakfast 
		of tea, french bread, and two fried eggs was “tres bon”. We don’t 
		exactly know what to do about the weather and biking. It is a choice 
		between bus or bikes but this rests solely with the weather. There ia a 
		very efficient train and bus service here. If the rain continues we will 
		test that efficiency.<br><br>I have just been out in the hall, 
		conversing in my elementary French with the lady of the house. She has a 
		son in England who is doing well as a painter. The dining room walls are 
		covered with oils of colorful small boats either under sail or resting 
		on the beach. We talked about the weather and the possibility of taking 
		the train up the coast. I had quite a time understanding what 
		“legerment” means when describing the drizzle outside. People pronounce 
		their language without consistency, and I find understanding difficult. 
		Our means ot finding our way this far has been a road map by the 
		Michelin Tire Company. We cannot get along without it And our small 
		dictionary is handy when we are stuck on a word.<br><br>Dick already has 
		had three tire blowouts. Last night we found out why. It is a tiny nail 
		that had penetrated the outer tire and had escaped our discovery as it 
		perforated the tubes. But patching is fairly easy. We are becoming 
		proficient as we go along. Dick keeps the expense account up to date 
		very efficiently, and says he enjoys doing it. Prices are apt to 
		decrease from here on so we can spend a little more on each item and 
		still stay within our limit. Love Ted<br><br>3 5 AP RIL 20..DICK<br><br>
		<br><br>It is great to at last be on the road and away after five days 
		of delay. However, rain is again pouring down, dampening everything 
		except our spirits. We are writing in our spacious oceanside room at 
		Pension Louise in Le Lavendu, as the rain comes down outside on the 
		veranda and the sun pecks peacefully at its base. As the wind has sprung 
		up, we hope it will blow our clouds of gloom away and send us to a new 
		day of adventure.<br><br>On Saturday, our first day of riding, we 
		pedaled some 80 kilometers,.taking it easy and enjoying the new and ever 
		changing views of rustic peasant life, and, of course, nature’s 
		beauties. Gears are great aids, making ascending moderate grades a 
		pleasure. We are continually shifting from one gear to another of our 
		three speeds so as to ride with the least exertion.<br><br>Ted has told 
		you of our morning ride over the great(as it seems to us as we 
		pushed)granite divide between Aubgne and the sea. As we left the main 
		highway to Toulon and turned off and up this mountain road, vineyards 
		stretched out on both sides-just small parcels of green sprouting from 
		neatly trimmed branches. As we climbed, though, the fertile soil became 
		rocks, then boulders, and finally solid masses of weather beaten granite 
		with long-needled pines and oaks springing through the cracks. A 
		terrific gale of wind whistled through these trees with the powerful 
		noise of a freight train. Several times Ted yelled &quot;timber&quot;”, meaning a 
		car is coming, as a new gust roared. He thought a train was approaching.<br>
		<br>Small quarries dot the hills, while wild flowers common also to 
		California and familiar foliage girded streams. We might have been in 
		Amador County, needing only a Silver Lake and Dad on a horse coming down 
		the road to make the comparison complete. At several turns in the road 
		we met the full force of the wind as it tore down a canyon, for the 
		moment making riding impossible. At other times, blasts would come from 
		behind, sending us ap a grade at breakneck speed. On the other hand 
		riding up a hill was real work, but we intoned the old saying that 
		”Everything that goes up must come down”. The long coast down was ample 
		reward. We would put the gears on high, forget our brakes and “move”. 
		What sport!<br><br>Below us, terraced land stretched for miles up 
		sloping valleys, and then down to the sea. Olive trees and picturesque 
		sandstone walls lined both sides of the roads we whipped down the last 
		few kilometers into La Ciotat and our first real view of the Riviera.<br>
		<br>At this moment we cannot say we are thrilled at its beauty, for here 
		before us was a coast not nearly as picturesque as familiar Monterey. 
		Solid banks of clouds did their best to keep “Old Sol” hidden. Our first 
		view of the sea was not in the best light. However we are told that this 
		is only an introduction to what is to follow from Toulon to Monte Carlo. 
		It is probably true that overcast limited the beauty of our first views.<br>
		<br>Whistling winds turned the peaceful coves of azure water into plains 
		of white caps, great rollers crashing on rock bound shores, throwing 
		great plumes sky ward. Beauty lay in the hills, not the sea, for they 
		are covered with the yellows of Scotch Broom , the whites of of daisies, 
		the reds of berries and wild tulips(that’s what they look like to us), 
		and the blues of shooting stars. We could easily imagine ourselves on 
		Cadaverous slopes, for all of these flowers are common to our Golden 
		State. I have named only a few of the varieties. Our knowledge of 
		wildflowers is not great despite Ted and I achieving the botany merit 
		badge in scouting. We are pressing buds of the most beautiful and 
		strange flowers. We must learn the name of this prolific tulip-like 
		flower.<br><br>Charming new beach homes, modern and simple, line the 
		entire coast, sheltered from stormy winds by spreading cypress and 
		majestic elms. Every home has its wall of masonry, and its terraced 
		garden, and, of course, some quaint name such as “Viile a Azur”, “Villa 
		de Faix”, or “Villa de la Plage”. Great trucks, speeding busses and new 
		low four cylinder autos, roaring by, are the only sounds to break the 
		quiet and peace of this tree-protected haven.<br><br>Each coastal town 
		is laid out on the sea coves sheltered slopes. Narrow streets climb 
		through the villages from broad beaches lined with sidewalk cafes. How 
		full of life’s vigor must be these water fronts be in summer when 
		beaches are packed and vacationers fill the cafes, serving those who 
		relish a snifter or two. It was at just such a place that we sat and 
		guzzled a demi-bier, with some pastry from the patisserie nearby. I 
		suspect we will miss these shops when traveling in Italy, but perhaps 
		spaghetti and ravioli will do the same.<br><br>The ride, or should i say 
		perpetual bounce from Le Seyne to Toulon can be indexed in our 
		travelogue as “torture #1”. The freres Lyon were pretty darned tired 
		after riding so far on the first day, and repairing to flats. The 
		cobblestone road of seven kms. loosened everything inside and outside. 
		In order that you can appreciate the circumstance, just try riding off 
		and on a curb for 45 minutes and you will get the idea. What one needs 
		for this type of travel are rubber wrists . If the cobblestones continue 
		we expect to turn into latex any moment.<br><br>Toulon is the San Diego 
		of France, its bay is filled with “men of war” and its streets filled 
		with blue and white sailors, all in uniforms. Traffic seems to be 
		confined to the cobblestone streets. One walks through narrow colorful 
		side streets to shop. Toulon is a classic French city, though it is much 
		cleaner with a more fraternal atmosphere than Marseilles. Everyone walks 
		briskly. As in Marseilles, the streets are active. Shops close and open 
		on time, not unlike the American scene.<br><br>Our Holland-America “Hand 
		Me Down” recommended the Hotel Bristol, it in the low price range we can 
		afford. No bath was available at our price level, we took a ”not even a 
		squirt bath” with a wet rag and soap. It ws still refreshing after the 
		day’s ride. While Ted sewed up a rip in his pants, I shaved off my 
		verdant growth with cold water. ”Chaud” our landlady said.<br><br>
		Presentable, we ambled down the street and happened on a petite and 
		delightful restaurant, the “Chez Bernard”. It was homey with tulips on 
		each table and motherly advice from our hostess. We devoured the bread 
		and a little vin rouge did its part . We waddled out with that truly 
		satisfied feeling that “Chesterfield” talks so much about. Then, a short 
		walk to the hotel, a snack of hydration from our beer bottle, and a 
		welcome bed topped off the first day of the Frere’s Lyon as bikers 
		through Europe We are weary but content boys, looking forward.<br><br>
		Lots of love..Dick<br><br>PS We are having fun talking with our French 
		acquaintances. We understand most everything said and can get what we 
		wish. That little dictionary is the trick of it.# 6..Ted..Frejus April 
		21<br><br><br><br>The whole day has been rainy and, altogether, just 
		dismal. But the Lyon brothers keep driving ahead. Morning was spent 
		writing and reading in the hope that the storm would let up. At noon 
		there was still no sign<br><br>of sunshine. Thus, we had lunch at the 
		pension, and then caught the train at the station nearby. The short 
		visit in Le Lavendu has been very pleasant. The train is a modern, 
		two-car diesel powered affair and runs on narrow-gauge rails. We must 
		have looked quite spiffy as we shot over the ground and along the 
		seashore. Rain was continuos but we did get occasional glimpses of the 
		famous scenery outside. The shadings in blue of the shallow waters along 
		with rocky points and sheltered beaches gave us a little idea of the 
		beauty we were perhaps missing. However, the famous Riviera is still 
		below our expectations. Perhaps it has been oversold. Perhaps we are 
		seeing it at its far from best. Perhaps we are spoiled by knowledge of 
		our own Monterey coastline beauty. But the best may yet to come. We do 
		love the the rustic landscape, green and brown with vineyards and farm 
		houses.<br><br>We conversed in French with a fellow passenger who did 
		his best to help us with such simple phrases as “Bon Jour&quot; and French 
		for “the rain is bad”. also, “We Americans are touring Europe on 
		bicycles when it doesn’t rain”, and so on. Late in the afternoon we 
		alighted at our destination, recovered our bilks from the baggage car, 
		and started for Frejus, a small town noted for its Roman ruins. Or first 
		ruin was a tower, half of its walls standing, with a few windows that 
		would allow sentries and legionaries a view or a bow shot. Nearby is the 
		aqueduct, one of many we hope to see. It lies in ruins too. We took a 
		closer look, passing several artists, recreating what is or once was. We 
		were soon on a cobblestone promenade. On the rocks of the stream below 
		were fishermen with long bamboo poles. Things were picking up in this 
		our first real brush with the ancient world. What next? Part of the 
		narrow thoroughfare was tunneled and children played contentedly in the 
		street. For once, there was no fear of automobiles. As we looked up at 
		the shuttered windows, so appealing, an occasional one was open as a 
		shadowed face looked down at us.<br><br>At the church, three priests 
		were studying its walls, as though making plans for repairs. And then 
		came the town market. Here Dick purchased some oranges, and snapped 
		photos of a few of the villagers in conversation.<br><br>Then, off again 
		and bumpty-bump over these “blamed” cobbles to the small harbor, and 
		with a single visiting New York yacht tied up. Across the harbor in the 
		setting of blue sea and white clouds is Fort Carre where Napoleon was 
		imprisoned for a time.<br><br>A late breakfast of oranges was had under 
		its battlements. Now for the first time we could see Nice ahead. Clouds 
		were gathering again, so we got quickly under way. We covered the 15 
		miles to Nice against a stiff wind. For the first time, on the level we 
		had to use “low gear” to make headway On our left was the tiny town of 
		Cagnes, with its castle topping the hill.<br><br>On reaching Nice, our 
		first need was food. The “Hand Me Down” suggested ‘Du Boef A La Mode’ 
		with a highly recommended menu and “prix fixe” of 9.50 francs. Our 
		budget could stand it. In we went. It was obviously a poplar place. The 
		first surprise came when Dick read on the menu “1/2 dos. escargots”. 
		Thinking this must asparagus, we ordered them. Were our faces red when 
		i/2 dozen snails appeared. With straight and serious faces, we ate the 
		lot. To our surprise whey were tasty, surely different from what we see 
		in the garden, and the sauce made the discovery delicious. Yes, we are 
		mastering the language also by mastication.<br><br>How about desert? The 
		menu says “pommes de terre”. Our limited French designated these as 
		apples, and perhaps even a pie. Potatoes, of course! With serious faces 
		still, the potatoes were devoured. The final revelation, or should i say 
		“blow” came when I ordered “apricot” something. A little helping of jam 
		appeared. But our ability to make the most of french bread at every meal 
		let us spread on the jam. Did we “save face”? I doubt it but we had 
		gotten our money’s worth. Where to stay? A newsman from new York 
		suggested this hotel and so be it.<br><br>To become oriented, we went 
		first to the Consulate and then made a vain attempt to reach the Rotary 
		President,, and then to American Express, with a final stop at the 
		Italian Tourist Bureau(C.I.T.). Another cloud burst was no help, as we 
		dodged rain drops and rushed to our hotel. Nothing new about this.<br>
		<br>First things first. We cleaned up the bikes and then purchased a 
		huge loaf of French bread at the patisserie. Then to the Grocerie for “a 
		petite balle of vin rose veux”, a small bottle of red wine, just old and 
		not vintage. These two additions to our paper cup of honey purchased in 
		Frejus, coupled with a bar of chocolate from Cagnes, made a delightful 
		supper. The walk up the main street, ogling the brightly decorated shop 
		windows had its effect. Sleep was sound and refreshing.# 7 April 
		21...Dick<br><br><br><br>Ted and I went to bed last night hoping for as 
		sunny day tomorrow. Our wishes were fulfilled. We could not be favored 
		by a more perfect morning to enjoy our first glimpse of the real 
		Riviera, running from St.Raphael to Cannes, the Newport of French 
		vacation land. Here we are spending the afternoon as the guest of 
		Monsieur Le President, Le Docteur Gimbert.<br><br>It was with quaking 
		hearts and shaking hands that we opened the shutters in Frejus to find 
		what weather awaited us outside. There was great rejoicing as the sun 
		streamed in, foretelling a glorious day on the Riviera. Quickly we 
		dressed and ran across the street to our discovery of the night before-a 
		patisserie serving tea and pastry which cost little but would be 
		filling. It is a real event when this occurs for the French “petite 
		dejeuners” barely tickle our palates. A cup of tea and two rolls just 
		serve as appetizers and whet out palates for more that never comes. By 
		dinner time we are ravenous.<br><br>Within a few minutes we were packed 
		and away, first hiking up the street to gain some views of the roman 
		ruins which we had visited in the fading light the night before. Frejus 
		awakens and is immediately busy in the early “matin”. Shopkeepers were m 
		making ready for the day’s transactions. The street market was in full 
		swing as we pedaled up the narrow main thoroughfare and out of the town 
		on its eastern side by a crumbling brick tower, a grass mantled 
		amphitheater, and an aqueduct arch, all reminders of Roman times,<br>
		<br>I since have had an odd thought. As we see these vestiges of what 
		were Roman walls and aqueducts, and think of the still permanent 
		monuments still intact in Egypt, how did they do it all without 
		machinery we take so for granted. Here after almost 2000 years, only a 
		mound of bricks would be left if visionary citizens did not bolster 
		crumbling foundations to preserve a monument to a colossal empire. Yet 
		in Luxor and Karnak, temples, sphinx, and pyramids still stand after 
		5000 years of abrasion by flying sand. I wonder what we will leave to a 
		civilization 1000 years hence.<br><br>The Cathedral of Notre Dame at St 
		Etinne gave us our first view an an early church, built with great stone 
		blocks topped by a gilt belfry which can be seen for miles rising above 
		the surrounding steep tile roofs. We could almost hear the clanking of 
		armor as “knights of yore” drew back the church’s great timber door, it 
		adorned with Renascence carving, and entered to pray before one of the 
		several alters set in dark recesses beneath low domed ceilings. A few 
		photos of early morning street scenes and we were off again down the 
		road which led out of the ancient hill town into the world below with 
		its scenic beauty. The few kilometers between Frejus and St.Raphael went 
		by quickly. The day was still young as were are our legs. After passing 
		along the waterfront lined solidly with hotels and pensions, our road 
		left the city and struck out over a rolling terrain which would 
		continuum all of the way to Cannes. At times we would climb several 
		hundred feet or so, gaining fine perspectives of the now ragged 
		pine-hung shore, then be rewarded with a long coast to some quiet bay or 
		inlet. Each promontory is decked out with with modest homes and terraced 
		gardens sloping to the sea. A sumptuous villa would appear, shaded by 
		groves of pines. To the land ward, reddish bare peaks rise to great 
		heights, casting their reflections on mirror-like waters of sheltered 
		bays. We had many a long pull as the road rose and twisted, before it 
		rewarded us with the swift ride down. For the very first time we doffed 
		our sweaters and enjoyed the morning sun filtering through our polo 
		shirts.<br><br>As we rounded the point above Theorile, we gained our 
		first view of the Golfe de la Napoule, with Cannes lying lazily on its 
		farther side. Along the coast approaching La Napoule, magnificent 
		villas, almost mediaeval, with great stone turreted walls rose in 
		silhouette. It was beneath just such a one of these castles that we sat 
		on the rocks and enjoyed the delicious flow of oranges, some of them 
		from Spain. Then a ride along the beach for several miles to the 
		outskirts of Cannes and the beginning of its famous beach.<br><br>Cannes 
		is said to be the ideal summer resort of the entire Riviera. What held 
		the most interest for us, however, was the “old port”, filled with 
		fishing craft. Some were resting on the beach or in dry dock Lines of 
		magnificent yachts are tied up along the great quay. We have never 
		before seen such a concentration of floating castles, truly large and 
		bedecked with flying banners. What a contrast to the tiny fishing boats 
		whose owners sit on the beach as they mend their nets. And their nets 
		are precious, I had never realized how delicate they are, and the 
		exquisite unremitting care they require They were drying on the 
		walls-strands as fine as thread and unbroken.<br><br>A beautiful tree 
		lined avenue, in fact several avenues with shaded squares border the 
		waterfront. An ancient stone church stands on the summit of the highest 
		hill and there we were given a splendid view of all below. We were 
		fascinated by the activity and beauty below us. and spent a good part of 
		the afternoon just looking.<br><br>It took a good deal of riding before 
		we found a restaurant suited to our pocketbook. Our final discovery was 
		a gem-lunch with wine for 10 francs at a sidewalk table fronting on the 
		“Old port”. As we ate, an aged couple played for us on mandolin and 
		guitar, but the final result was marred as their “pooch” insisted on 
		howling in harmony. With a few donations gained, they hobbled done the 
		street, presumably to a cafe with more affluent customers.<br><br>A 
		hotel or pension we must find for the night. Following the Hand Me Down 
		we have learned is the privilege of those with a little more to spend 
		than we. We rode along the Rue Clemenceau to “Dos granges”. Again, too 
		dear. But “Pension des Alpes” across the street fitted answered our 
		needs, with twin beds, an enormous sea view room, and hot and cold 
		water- all for 18 francs. As yet we have not found a Hostel, for 
		apparently that modern convenience has not been accepted in France. So 
		for the present, hotels and pensions must fill our needs.<br><br>
		Traveling as we are, we must know the language, or a bit ot it to get 
		along. Few proprietors speak English. If one travels in “class”, 
		language is not a problem. However, as we buy delicatessen and 
		patisserie meals we must converse in French. What about Italy ahead? 
		Guess we can make do there too. <br><br>Our Rotary contact said that the 
		meeting would be that evening. We called on the President, Monsieur Le 
		Doctor Gimbert, who lived just a few blocks away. He received us 
		graciously and invited us to the meeting as his guest. He is a fine 
		looking man who speaks excellent English and might easily be picture in 
		one of the Fleischman Yeast ads, manicured whiskers and all.<br><br>A 
		very quick dip in the cold sea served as our bath, and it was free 
		instead of an 8 franc warm bath at the pension. We had a little time but 
		walked the town until *8 PM and the Rotary meeting. And what did we see? 
		Row after row od magnificent hotels along the waterfront. They all are 
		prosperous, being full in both summer and winter, we are told. 
		Glittering lights sparkle through the glass of the sea view windows. Our 
		interest beaconed us down the beach just long enough for us to have to 
		make run back to the Hotel Victoria in time. Dr. Gimbert immediately 
		grabbed us and introduced us to each off the thirty members, only a few 
		able to converse in English. At eight o’clock we walked into the main 
		dining room, the Rotary table at the far end. Everything was informal 
		and hotel guests examined us with curiosity as we took our seats, red 
		and blue sweaters and all. Mr. Bidelli, sitting next to me, is the 
		manager of Italian Lines in Cannes and gave me valuable advice about his 
		country. White wines with soup and fish. Red wines the entree. That is 
		the correct order that we must learn. Everyone took his time, joking and 
		laughing, and thoroughly enjoying themselves and the meal. A plate of 
		asparagus, not escargots, is served after the fish.<br><br>The meeting 
		was called to order after two hours of eating. Everyone speaks rapidly 
		and at once. Dr. Gimbert every tried to bring order with a bang on the 
		bell. We later found out that plans were being made for French Rotary 
		Convention in Cannes, and everyone was making sure his job was in order. 
		At ten o’clock drew nigh, the Lyons’ eye lids began to droop., The 
		meting soon ended. We thanked all and bid goodbye to hurry through a 
		drizzle to our pension.<br><br>Time seems to get scarcer and scarcer, so 
		I have just whipped this letter out in short order. Today we prepare for 
		our journey into Italy, so must off and away. APRIL 22 # 8 TED NICE<br>
		<br><br><br>We are finally in Nice on the Riviera. One are staying in a 
		reasonably priced hotel. After last evening’s Rotary meeting in Cannes, 
		we slept too soundly and the morning was well under way before we 
		awakened to find the sun a jump ahead. Quickly we packed our knapsacks 
		and strapped them on the bikes.<br><br>From our pension window we could 
		enjoy a small colorful garden below and the picturesque Golfe de la 
		Napoule flanked on each side by the mainland low snow-like clouds. And 
		adjoining are the islands St. Maguerite and St. Homert. It was for sure 
		the lovely day we had so wished for.<br><br>Down through the city of 
		Cannes we rode, then along the sandy coast, around the Golfe Juan, 
		through Jaun l Les p Pins to the town of Antibes. In full view of Nice, 
		we cycled happily. All along the road were summer resorts and 
		year-around hotels, looking inactive because of the disagreeable 
		weather. As we rounded a point, Antibes came suddenly into view, modern 
		and ancient, and with Roman arches standing dilated as they lay 
		scattered over the land. Vines climb over the old stones as momentous of 
		Rome when in full glory. And to one side, camouflaged by pine trees 
		which have grown through cracks in its foundation is an amphitheater, 
		probably built in the second century.<br><br>Because the the rain was so 
		depressing we decided to go back to our lodging and make the trip again 
		the next morning . On our way, we stopped at a small shop to get some 
		oranges. There on the counter was Libby’s fruit salad and canned 
		asparagus. All of the shops have Nestle’s chocolate, and American fruit 
		is here as well For dinner, or supper as it turned out to be, we had tea 
		and cakes at a patisserie across from the hotel., and then to bed for a 
		good sleep.<br><br>We plan to get to Nice on Wednesday and to take care 
		of steamship and railway tickets, and other business as well. We still 
		hope for good weather tomorrow.April 23 Monaco about Nice Ted<br><br>
		<br><br>I am sitting on my bed and writing on a bed-table while Dick is 
		doubled over on the other bed, desperately trying to patch the seat of 
		his only pair of pants(top grade gray flannel they were). He has very 
		ingeniously cut out some cloth from inside the pant leg and has pinned 
		it to the inside of the hole with safety pins. Quite a sight. But I 
		really am not despairing of Dick’s seamstress abilities-yet.<br><br>It 
		is great fun finding hotels at a moderate price. Dick takes one side and 
		I the other of the street. We say to each proprietor, “Avez vous une 
		chanbre avec lits pour deux? Combien? “ And if his price is too high, we 
		say “trop cher” in sad voices. Then he usually comes down and we take a 
		look at a room. Last night the single bed “pour deux” was uncomfortably 
		small for the two of us, so now we shall ask from here on for “deux 
		lits” instead of “un grands lit”.<br><br>This morning we awake to find 
		the sun shining. We got the cramps out of our backs from the small 
		double bed, for to 6’3’s are measurements that can’t fit these half- 
		pint beds. After dressing in our ”Oh,what shall I wear this morning, 
		Dick?” “well” says Dick, “I think I will try my new riding habit or 
		perhaps just a breakfast suit”. “Well, I’m not particular. I think I 
		will put on tweed sporties or my green gabardine afternoon coat”, I 
		chime in. So we both climbed into our utility suits and rode down the 
		street on our trusty steeds to a patisserie for some tea and some of 
		those “hot from the oven” breakfast buns.<br><br>The first thing for the 
		day was the Russian Cathedral. Its green tiled domes and minarets rise 
		above the red tiled roofs of the city and seem be very out of place. 
		However, by itself it is an impressive structure.<br><br>Across the city 
		over the half cobblestone half paved busy streets, we rode to the ruins 
		of a Roman arena, now nothing more than piles of stones in the form of a 
		circle with two large entrances at each end. Near it was a huge hotel 
		with a magnificent backdoor view of Nice. Then down into the old section 
		of the city where the buildings are tall and the streets narrow and 
		winding. And along these alleys, as one might call them, are the small 
		quaint shops. Butcher shops have their sausages lined in front of the 
		windows. Bakeries also displayed similarly their sticks of bread. And 
		the streets were filled with housewives shopping, children playing, and 
		curious people just staring at the tall Americans in red and blue 
		sweaters pushing bicycles. Of course the town church was there on the 
		public square, and the Prefecture not far away.<br><br>But we soon left 
		the bartering and the buying behind to climb the irregular slope of the 
		hill that divides Nice into two parts, the Old Port and surrounding 
		buildings and the new and much larger section. The day was unusually 
		clear and many were on top of the hill to enjoy the view. Snow covered 
		mountains lie behind the range of hills in back of the city. Antibes and 
		the shoreline stretch our into the distance, and Nice and its huge 
		casino and shaded boulevards between large hotels, lay below us. Just a 
		sea of red tiled roofs.<br><br>To the east on the other side is the 
		picturesque “Old Port”: which is sheltering expensive yachts and one or 
		two small freighters. A boat under full white canvas sail was rounding 
		the point, to complete the picture. Down the hill past an inspiring war 
		memorial. so common in French cities, lies the main boulevard. The 
		street itself is a grand one divided by green planting. And along the 
		shore in front of us stretches an extensive walk lined with blue and 
		white parasols and crowded with folks in their Thursday best. Poodles 
		and hounds alike were being given their noon walks and in the public 
		beach chairs everywhere are fashionably dressed men and women thoroughly 
		enjoying themselves.<br><br>But lunch us was calling, so back to the 
		hotel to pack and then to lunch again at the restaurant of yesterday’s 
		appearance.<br><br>It seems incredible that we are now in Monte Carlo on 
		the Riviera. Tonight the Casino was illuminated brightly and a every 
		corner we found a new picture to photo just in our minds.<br><br>On 
		April 13th they had an automobile race through the city. Too bad we 
		couldn’t have had the experience of seeing it. At any rate, we sure are 
		having the time of our lives and wishing that you could be here 
		too...Ted# 9 Monte Carlo Ted April 24<br><br><br><br>Tonight will be our 
		second here. We are not far from the Casino. Our reason for staying the 
		extra night is not to break the bank. We have been unable to obtain 
		pemican to get in until tomorrow morning. We aren’t properly dressed. We 
		are students. We are under age. The man at the desk was curt in his 
		answers, so we forfeited a traveling day to see another world. But, mind 
		you, our day was well spent. Breakfast of yesterday’s biscuits and hot 
		tea was “it” as usual, but improved is our “dunking” technique. After a 
		visit to American Express and another refusal of admittance to the 
		Casino, we started he long steep climb to the Grande Corniche, the 
		Riviera’s highest road of three( there is the Middle and the Lower) 
		pushing bikes all of the way up the 1800 feet. As we climbed we walked 
		awhile and rode awhile and vocalized in harmony. We’re getting so that 
		we manage songs quite handily, and it speeds the time.<br><br>The unique 
		Grande Corniche possesses possibly the tiniest village in the world, Le 
		Turbie. It is a survey point for the entire Riviera panorama. # 10 0 Ted 
		Monaco April 25<br><br><br><br>It’s a glorious morning. We have just 
		been to the Casino. We were admitted and put in the charge of a guide 
		who spoke machine-gun French. I won’t attempt to describe the fine 
		points, for time and vocabulary are limited The Casino is a large long 
		building composed of six large ornate rooms.The first objects to catch 
		our eyes were the gaming tables, lighted with low lamps and with large 
		chandeliers above.<br><br>We learned that there are many kinds of games 
		designed to provide fun while taking away your money. There was an 
		American roulette section, and a game where toy airplanes revolve about 
		a disc. There are games where money is exchanged faster or slower as one 
		would wish.<br><br>On either end of the building is a large quite 
		beautiful room, a private salon for special gamblers. Another section is 
		the theater. Adjoining is a bar and along the sea front are smaller 
		rooms with sweeping views of the harbor.<br><br>And here are a few 
		personal observations.<br><br>The walls and ceilings are embellished 
		with striking paintings and frescoes. Gold lief surfacing extends about 
		the rooms in a multitude of patterns. Crystal chandeliers and mirrors 
		are abundant. Covering the floors is a soft blue velvet carpet. Tall 
		doors with embroidered curtains open out on to terraces and balconies. 
		This was quite enough ostentation for us, but then the guide took us to 
		the theater. Boy, what an overwhelming sight! Why look at the stage at 
		all, for decoration is blinding. Figures and scenes cover every inch of 
		the walls and ce[ling, and tall glass doors open to the promenade on the 
		outside.<br><br>The theater holds only 600. The several boxes at the 
		back and corners dominate the room, The guide finally conceded that the 
		box in the middle was for the only the Prince of Monaco. The mayor and 
		the theater owner would sit in the remaining two boxes. High above the 
		stage in the right corner was the opera master’s seat, and opposite him, 
		the opera director.<br><br>How about a picture? As Dick hit the button, 
		the guide cried “Defender, defender”. Only when we opened the dictionary 
		back at the hotel did we discover the meaning as “Prohibited”, a word we 
		expect to hear again. But we escaped with the camera as the guide did 
		his duty.<br><br>Well, we have seen Monte Carlo, and our patience and 
		effort was well rewarded. Of course the players in tuxedos were not 
		sitting for their pictures, but a wheel turner with a sense of humor 
		smiled for a take. Ted<br><br><br><br>are not in our picuthearprs/. awuu

		not in style here. He creates quite a stir as well as mirth from 
		spectators, but in the day’s warmth he is comfortable. .<br><br>I have 
		never seen the sea quite so blue as it appeared today as we looked down 
		from the heights directly above Monaco. From our point of vantage at La 
		Turbie, famous for its Tower of Augustis, we could see the Riviera from 
		French Cannes on the right, to Italy’s Ventimiglia on the left, and the 
		Italian coastline, our next destination, faded into the distance. Far 
		off to the north are the Esterl Mountains, their winter snow caps still 
		fresh and glistening.<br><br>And it was there. at La Turbie with its 
		ruined tower that again we feasted on delicious French bread and honey, 
		as the azure blue sea of the Rivera spread out before us. I doubt we 
		will ever forget this day.<br><br>A bar of chocolate added to our 
		enjoyment as we left the mountain top and sped down the winding narrow 
		road, past the quaint village of Rosenbrunn and its midlevel castle. We 
		dropped the 1800 feet to ride again on the streets of Monaco. and walk 
		on the promenade. Our ride took us past the Old Fort and the harbor with 
		magnificent yachts at anchor, and to the Peninsula with the Casino,

		Carlo as our Riviera ride draws to a close. It’s hard to believe that we 
		are not dreaming. We pinch our selves in true H.B.Lyon style.The first 
		view of the Casino last night, radiant in lights and with its stream of 
		chaufered limousines driving up to the entrance, is one we won’t forget. 
		Monte Carlo in all its glory is a grand sight.<br><br>What a day! What a 
		ride! That should desribe our day’s journey over Mayanne Corniche from 
		Nice to Monaco. We started this memorable day with a bang by putting 
		away a great meal at Boef a al Mode and at the time almost caused a 
		national catastrophe. As Ted told you, we purchased a bottle of “vinn de 
		pays” and found it too much to consume at one sitting. We had a half- 
		bottle left from yesterday. <br><br>I remembered seeing French gentlemen 
		at Le Boef pouring wine into their glasses from a small bottle concealed 
		in their coats, so I suggested that we do the same with our half bottle. 
		We wrapped it in a scarf and walked boldly into Le Boef, bottle unde 
		arm. Everything seeemed OK until we sat down and our waitress said 
		“Voulez-vous du vin?”, whereupon Ted placed our bottle on the table. 
		“Nous avons le notre” we replied, with a look of triumph. Our waitress 
		spoke to the headwaiter who suddenly glowered. Elderly folks arounf us 
		smiled . At or with? Hostility saturated the air waiting to condense in 
		big globules on us. We manfully maintained our stance, smiled back to 
		all and started eating our bread. As the storm clouds dissappated, we 
		Lyon Brothers set about to quietly enjoy our meal. But the fun was not 
		yet over. When the the bill came we found “sans vin: 1.80 francs”. So we 
		were being charged for not buying their wine and drinking our own.<br>
		<br>Things were becoming complicated when our waitress pointed to a sign 
		on the menu which said “sans baisson: .60” . So that is what “:baisson” 
		meant-just drink. We were now completely deflated. Bottle under arm once 
		more, now empty, for we could receive a refund of 36 centimes from the 
		wine store, the Lyon freres managed to reach the street in almost a 
		single stride, yet nonethe worse for wear. We did not mean to strain 
		American-French relations while being educated. We had just committed a 
		boner, I suspect not or first or last, and without trying to hide our 
		intentions or ignorance.This episode should be titled “:One little 
		bottle a sitting on the table, thankfull to be seen and enjoyed by just 
		th two of us”.<br><br>A brisk few minutes walk, bottle under arm, and we 
		were back at our “Hotel Britainique”. Twenty minutes later we were on 
		our bikes, pedaling on the “La Promenade des Anglais’ to the Old Fort 
		and the Mayonne Corniche, the beautiful mountain road to take us along 
		the Corte d’Angust, aptly named stetch of shoreline between Nice and 
		Monaco.<br><br>We stopped at the Italian Tourist Bureau and purchased 
		two railway tickets from the French brder to Naples, Venice, Milan and 
		over the Simplon Pass to Switzerland. The price was equivalent to $20, 
		American. This is just slightly more than two tickets only to Rome. It 
		is a bargain as well as it buys valuable time for our travels. We can 
		get off the train and ride for stretches along the way. Everything we 
		spend in Italy will be paid with out 1500 Letter of Credit giving a us a 
		30% better excnage rate. Sure can use it,<br><br>As we rounded “Denjen 
		de Chateau”, the peak providing expansive morning views, we could see 
		for miles from the ocean-front promenade (Quais des Etas Unis and 
		Promenade des Anglais, now in afternoon sunlight, both lined with blue 
		and white umbrellas sheltering the crowds enjoying the first summer 
		weather. The ocean roared at it lapped lapped on the gravel geaches, 
		draggibng pebbles back and forth with a clatter. A khaki-shirted painter 
		stood in the shade of the Charteau, catching on his canvas the spirit 
		and personality of a Nice waterfront.<br><br>There were three routes 
		open to us from Nice to Monaco, L’Inferior Corniche, La Mayanne 
		Corniche, and La Grande Corniche, the highest and most spectacular of 
		the three. These percipitous roads are engineering triumphs, having been 
		chisled out of and through what appears ro be solid rock, thus many 
		tunnels. Because we were advised to take the Mayanne Corniche, not as 
		difficul a climb, and and yet not giving up anything in its views, we 
		agreed to test its merits. Our climb started some 10 blocks beyond the 
		Old Port and wound back for and forth for the 8 1/2 kilometers to 
		Monaco. At a point just i50 feet above the city, we had a view of the 
		entire ride ahead. The Bay of Naples, a solid sheet of shimmering gold 
		below wastrimmed with the red-tiled roofs of dwellings on the shores.<br>
		<br>The climb was stiff all of the way. At first, we could not begin to 
		enjoy the beauty below for heads looked down as we pumped. Thus we chose 
		to walk and push and thus “see”. Everything, was in oiur favor-a fine 
		road, a perfect sunny day and with just a few clouds that enhance our 
		photos As we climbed higher we looked down upon a sea of azure blue in 
		the depths, turning to a light blue-green in the shallows pircing the 
		rugged shore. Each jutting promentory along the road had its villa and 
		terrraced grdens. Each bay below had its red-roofed town nestling in 
		hollows. Cape Ferrat, a long knotty arm sticking out into the blue-green 
		constanly catches the eye. La Mayanne Corniche is busy without respit, 
		beginning with our bikes, but more concerned with a stream of crs from 
		rattle-traps to chauferred limousines,all whipping buy us at high 
		speeds, But there were a few who, like us, drove carefully and stopped 
		freqauently at turnouts, to enjoy views.<br><br>They certainly do things 
		in a big way here.,One dashing sport phaeton, in chromiun, orange and 
		black whipped by with a chauffer in livery matching the car. Do we envy 
		their luxury? No in the least. What king wouldn’t give his best pair of 
		pajamas to be pedaling with us, roughing through Europe and having the 
		time of our young lives.<br><br>The quaint tiny town of Eze offered a 
		charming break in our uphill journey, for here we found the real thing-a 
		mideavil hamlet seen only here, or perhaps in a copy at a World’s Fair. 
		Eze is on the steep slope of a tiny peak jutting out from our highway. 
		It must have taken lots of chewing gumo keep their out-house from 
		slipping down into the sea during a blowy night. Narrow cobblestone 
		streets, with arches, tiny stone houses and just above all, a crumbling 
		ancient Temple of Isis is relally there. It seems that in the fourth 
		century BC, the Phoenecians climbed the height to build this temple to 
		the goddess. and the town was later built below, inaccessable to 
		maurading bands.The name of the Egyptian God has been gradually modified 
		to a unique and appealing Eze.Whatr a photographer’s paaradise! I wish I 
		knew more about the science and art of photography, or were an artist 
		with my water colors to take full advanatage of such moments and scenes.<br>
		<br>A refreshing demi-bier and strength was gained fort the last few 
		kms. climb. Yes,we were still going up to the crest. And soon we were 
		there. The next moment we were zipping down to Monaco and Mont Carlo. 
		What a ride! Brakes were forgotten. We hunched low over the bars, 
		leaning steply around turns and whipping by our slower companions on the 
		road-the gas-guzzlers, until with some screming rubber we came to a 
		grinding stop in the heart of Monaco. Our first real view of The 
		Principality came as we rounded a turn high above the city and saw for 
		the first time the hanging gardens. arbors, flowers, and walks seming to 
		hang over the sea. More red roofs and stupendous hotels covered the 
		steep mountainside. Photos will have to replace words.<br><br>After just 
		a few minutes of searching we found the Rex Hotel, comfortable in the 
		less afluent part of town Twin beds for 11 francs. Not all bad. We 
		quiclkly cleaned up and supped at a nearby patisserie, and were able to 
		leave the table with that “satisfied feeling”. Lots of tea and day old 
		pastry bread made the meal. We have learned that “day old” is just as 
		good as fresh bread and costs half as much. We dunk it in the tea, so 
		that the stomach is full and the pocketbook(should I say “Money Belt”) 
		not ravaged. I supppose we will have to learn the tricks of the trade 
		all over again in Italy. On our first few days, we will stay in pensions 
		and see how thing go while we get the feel of things.<br><br>One of or 
		pleasantets evenings followed supper. We promenaded about on he shore 
		walks and observed the beautifully lit Casino alive with fur coats and 
		toxes as limousines drove up to deposit their glitttetinmg loads at the 
		glittering entrance.All of our observations were made from a park bench 
		at the border of tiny park just a block away. I could sit for hours 
		watching the endless show and wonderinmg just what it is all about-stars 
		instead of chandoliers, grass as rugs, a park bench as a Chesterfield, 
		and were twice as much conmtentment.<br><br>A brisk walk up then hill to 
		our suptious villa made us ptomptly hit the hay in preparation for 
		another full day. Today our expenses were exactly $3, just 2$ less than 
		each day in Marseilles. Tomorrow, Sarturday the 26th, we begin with our 
		scheduled Casino visit/Then we will ride to Ventimiglia. There we will 
		either take the train to Genoa, or instead, make the short bike ride to 
		San Remo. New thrills ahaed in Italy. Hope al well at 306, and a pat for 
		Ching(our chow). `.April 25 Menton-San Reamo<br><br><br><br>Today we are 
		in Genoa. seeing the town and will be off once more along the Riviera, 
		taking the train there tomorrow morning.<br><br><br><br>April 25<br><br>
		<br><br>What a day! This has been twelve hours we will never forget. It 
		took us 7 1/2 hours to cross the border from France into Italy, and all 
		because we were on bicycles. Great busloads of tourists flashed by as 
		we, the lonely bikers, underwent every kind of examination these guys 
		could trump up.<br><br>Here is the summary, and to the point.<br><br>
		1,We came to the French border above Menton after riding up a mile and 
		half grade. One and a half hours were required for them to prepare 
		certain papers allowing us to bring our bikes back into France, and 
		costing us 25 francs. If it had not been for an Englishman interpreter 
		hired by the French governenrt, we would still be there. tangled in the 
		coils of frowning Frenchmen whose job it is to make things as tough as 
		possible.<br><br>2.We then climbed up the grade to the Italian Police 
		Station, showed passports and passed.<br><br>3.Another i/3 mile and 
		still up, Italian Customs appeared where we were informed that 230 lira 
		were necessary for a deposit on each bike. American Express had told us 
		the fifteen lira was the fee and we were prepared for that.<br><br>4. It 
		was Saturday and 12:15 noon, so I rushed down to town trying to make the 
		bank, leaving Ted with our packs at the top.<br><br>5. Back through the 
		French customs and their bickering, went to Menton. All banks were 
		closed. But perhaps Cooks would open at 2 PM.<br><br>6. I sat around 
		chewing french bread and worrying about Ted up at the top.<br><br>7. At 
		2 I went to Cooks and was told that the exchange would be much better at 
		an italian company.<br><br>8. I went to Transit Co. and was told the 
		boss would not return until 2:30. Ted was still at the top.<br><br>9. I 
		returned to Cooks and cashed $32 on our Letter of Cedit for 480 francs. 
		I returned at 2;30 to Transit Co and was told I couldn’t have money 
		until 4Pm. They were sending for it.<br><br>11. I rode back up the grade 
		to French customs and found that Ted had gone down to look for me. After 
		certain formalities, I returned to Menton to wait until 4 PM when we 
		received lira at 100 to 103 francs, excellent exchange and saving us 
		many dollars. Ted found me.<br><br>12. We returned through French and 
		italian customs, all again up the grade, and paid out 400 lira, after 
		filling out a long unintelligible paper.<br><br>13. At 5:19 we rode on 
		up the grade, believing all problems were settled.<br><br>14. At one and 
		a half miles if further up the grade, we were told to go back by a 
		passing tourist.<br><br>15. Back down, we again showed our papers and 
		received stamps on our bikes, and then rode away again at 5;30, and 
		finally.<br><br>You can see that this was just another test, I guess, 
		and we passed. We must have learned something from it. We’ll see for we 
		have many more borders to cross.<br><br>At last we are in the ‘Land of 
		the tenors”, and flowers. Our first impressions, as we circled rocky 
		shores and passed through Italian towns, the first being Ventimiglia, 
		are as follows<br><br>1. Smiles, lending new warmth and hospitality to 
		our atmosphere. We immediately felt at home They seemed to laugh with, 
		not at us as was our experience in France as we string beans rode in 
		shorts and polo shirts.<br><br>2. Color; Kids in alpine green uniforms, 
		with plumes in their hats; officers in natty uniforms, with clinking 
		sabers and red-lipped damsels on their arms; flowers-carnations, roses, 
		geraniums. Terrace upon terrace of them. Gorgeous flower markets. Groups 
		of school children picking armfuls beside the road.<br><br>3. Dust on 
		some parts of the road, but fine highways; horse and wagons trotting 
		along; and a decided lack ot automobiles.<br><br>4. Neat well kept 
		homes. clean. and walled with real tile roofs and blue and green 
		shutters.<br><br>5. Everyone walks here, laughing and enjoying it. They 
		-seem to have joy in just living.<br><br>When we ride by and they see 
		just one of us, they look. When they see the two of us, they stare. 
		Shorts are evidently something new here but obviously needed for our 
		riding.<br><br>The journey from the border, some fifteen miles, was 
		covered in one hour.and we entered San Remo., famous winter resort, 
		especially for the English. However, England is not loved here now due 
		to her action on sanctions. So few of the English are sojourning here. 
		We say that we are Americans every chance we get, so as to make things 
		as easy as possible.<br><br>As we rode into San Remo everyone ws 
		promenading along the gardened waterfront and on the main street 
		cobblestones. Cops in snappy uniforms smiled at us, helping us as best 
		they could to understand their actions.The only traffic seemed to be a 
		few bicyclers.Evidently cars are abandoned on Saturday night.<br><br>We 
		sopped at a lovely Pensione Swizzera where 35 lira we had a beautiful 
		room and two meals, ample reward for our “day of days”. After a big 
		dinner, we too promenaded on the streets of the city. In our quarter, 
		gay flags, bright lights, and ringing bells seemed a natural. A great 
		bonfire glowed in the main square, where many stood in line to pray at 
		the tiny mission on one side. Evidently, Italy has had another Ethiopian 
		victory.<br><br>Our plans are this. It is expensive for us to take our 
		bikes on the train to Rome at about $2 apiece, so we will decide 
		tomorrow what to do. We will probably ride south about 20 miles to 
		Rapelle, sleep there, and then take the train to Pisa, stopping over for 
		a few hours, and then on to Rome for a week. Naples and Sorrento, then 
		Rome again, Florence, Venice, and then the bike ride over the Simplon 
		Pass to Geneva. We are allowing one month for Italy so that we will 
		probably be in Geneva by the 25th of May, Zurich about the 30th, and 
		Munich around the 11th of June. You can write accordingly. We intensely 
		look forward to your letters, as we are now doing. If you could have 
		some at each city, it would be wonderful<br><br>And, by the way, guess 
		what we had at our first two dinners in Italy? Spaghetti! Every town or 
		city’s name seems to end in “etti”, always suggesting that spaghetti is 
		there waiting for us.<br><br>A few more notes-All of the towns along the 
		Italian Riviera are protected from winds by an amphitheater of mountains 
		to the north. The “Riviera Ligure” extends from the border to La Spezia. 
		The western Riviera over which we have traveled is called the “Riviera 
		di Ponenti” while the “Riviera di Levante’ “ extends to the east. In 
		France the “Cote d’or” extends from Toulon to Nice, supplemented by the 
		more beautiful “Cote d’Azur” from Nice to Mentone.<br><br>This western 
		Riviera does a great trade in flowers. its hills are covered with 
		masonry supported terraces, looking like great steps. Olive trees for 
		olive oil is the other great industry. This is just a hurried summary of 
		events, but will have to do. We rush to finish seeing Genoa today and 
		then be off again to the south .<br><br>Rome calls.<br><br>We think 
		constantly of you and wonder how things are at home, expecting all to be 
		well. We’re anxious to hear how Bruce’s team came out in the tournament, 
		and if you are playing golf each weekend DickApril 26 San Remo-Genoa-<br>
		<br><br><br>The end of another busy day. This morning in San Remo we 
		awoke, dressed, had breakfast in our Pensione dining room of bread, jam, 
		and tea, a fine combination. Then we walked around and up behind the 
		town to see the panorama of houses and hills. Back of the city are small 
		farms, with vineyards -small and few they are exceptionally clean 
		looking. Today, Sunday, soldiers were all decked out in gay uniforms 
		with white gloves and people are out walking in their best clothes 
		saying “Buon giorn to each other as they pass. We were soon above the 
		city and looking down upon the roofs and farmhouses of the old section 
		of town. It wasn’t grand but tremendously interesting. We are intrigued 
		by the appearances of low doorways and tunneled streets so that we 
		carried our bicycles down some steep steps to get a better look These 
		houses and streets were aged and dirty and not the least inviting. Big 
		austere lamps now unused and cob webbed might have been very grand What 
		struck us most was the number of arches and connecting rafters from 
		house to house above narrow dark cobbled streetss. Being on the steps 
		were steep and winding, and it was if we were in a moving picture as we 
		too wound down. The elderly women were all dressed in plain black 
		clothes while the men wore every possible style. As we descended, the 
		steps widened and the houses seemed cleaner. All along the streets were 
		pipes and wires giving evidence of new sanitation, running water, and 
		electricity. It seemed likely that a poor neighborhood was being 
		renovated. Those that didn’t yet have electricity were doing their work 
		sitting in the doorway.<br><br>At the bottom is the public square, the 
		church, shops, and the flower market All the while we had walked, but 
		now as we left the old for the new we rode along quickly to get our 
		belongings and be on our way.<br><br>After boarding the train we were 
		soon speeding toward Genoa by way of Alassio and Savona, popular winter 
		and summer resorts. Between the countless short tunnels we caught 
		glimpses of the small Italian towns nestled at the heads of valleys with 
		snow capped sharp peaks beyond./ Several old battlement and castles went 
		by. The coastal scenes were attractive with small offshore islands, 
		although nothing to compare with our recent Riviera experiences in Nice 
		and Monaco. Olive and orange trees are plentiful among the scores of 
		small vineyards. Backyard fences and gardens are covered with flowers. 
		Fancily dressed policeman of the King and called Carbinieres promenade 
		in the wayside stations, their walls covered with splashy advertisements<br>
		<br>The minutes flew by as we scrutinized fellow passengers. As we stood 
		at the right side-the compartments are all on the left-and looked out 
		the windows, we conversed with several people in English and French.. 
		After making sure we are Americans they were congenial.Three 
		women.evidently on a holiday, promptly took possession of our 
		compartment. Overbearing and talkative they created plenty of sound for 
		the little compartment. Two Spaniards got off at Alessio where Lindbergh 
		and his family are planning to make their home.<br><br>Soon we were in 
		the outskirts of Genoa, the shore lined with boatyards.<br><br>With 
		bicycles secured from the baggage room, we rode out to find a hotel. 
		While looking for the American Express agent Dick struck up a 
		conversation with a gentleman who offered a place at a reasonable price. 
		It was not far away and looked good. We were soon to learn that we 
		weren’t in the desirable part of town, as a short walk from our lodging 
		proved.<br><br>The Plazza Aqueverde contains the large monument to 
		Christopher Columbus. Chris stands on top with one hand on the anchor 
		and the other on a kneeling Indian. The story of his exploits is 
		portrayed around the foundation with sculptured figures.<br><br>A 
		mediocre dinner was had.As is the custom, we had spaghetti, but the meat 
		was tough and dry, the house wine passable and the bread tough. We 
		didn’t touch the lettuce for we haven’t yet learned the rules with 
		greens.<br><br>After dinner the town was calling so we wandered down the 
		old streets, pushing bikes. It was still light and after being bawled 
		out by a policeman for braking some regulation we hadn’t understood, and 
		still don’t, we made out above the city to get a general idea of its 
		layout. This has become a habit for us in each new location where such 
		is possible. The huge Italian liner, The Rex, was in the harbor. Genoa 
		with all of its churches and multitude of gray buildings forms an 
		amphitheater for the busy port. The day was hazy and poor for pictures, 
		so back down to the main streets we went to examine one or two of the 
		offices housed in seventieth century palaces. We entered the Municipale, 
		or government office, for a brief visit. As it was getting late we 
		bought a bar of chocolate and a whip cream cone from small shop and 
		returned to our lodging for a good sleep<br><br>Just few more words as i 
		close. Tomorrow we plan to see a bit of Genoa and then head off towards 
		Pisa, on bikes as far as Rappello. In Pisa we will see the Tower and 
		then take off to Rome. We have been presented with the problem of 
		bicycle as freight which comes to 10 to 15 dollars whenever we travel by 
		train, and understand this is a one time charge. We feel we should have 
		the bikes in Naples to ride to Sorrento, Pompeii, and Amalfi, so are 
		paying up for the privilege.<br><br><br>12..AP[RIL 27...DICK IN ITALY 
		Genoa, writing on arriving in Rome<br><br><br><br>WE ARE REALLY IN ITALY 
		NOW., and are getting a taste of the romantic side, perhaps in a more 
		“true to life” manor than we have expected. It is 8 o’clock in the 
		evening as we write after a full day and before a visit to a “dog house” 
		or singing cafe this evening with a new Anmerican aqaintance, Don 
		Wasson, of whom I will tell you more .Below our window from the narrow 
		alley below we are receiving the romantic touch or flavor saver in the 
		form of rollicking music by a trio of street singers accompanying 
		themselves with violin and guitar. They are possibly advertising a 
		lottery, or some such Italian institution, of course government 
		controlled, but their music is quite real, full of harmony and life. 
		What a background to regroup our thoughts. Cries of the “banana woman” 
		as she adverises her tropical fruit are interjected into the harmony<br>
		<br>This is our first day in Genoa and it is a revelationWe have seen 
		things we never imagined except perhaps in our perception of Vatican 
		treasures and even fairy tales. We have enjoyed an honest to goodness 
		hot shower in a spic and span tile bathroom below Piazza Aquivardini in 
		one of Italy’s many Docias, or public baths. What a glorious feeling to 
		be really shining new after a day of pedaling.<br><br>Four lira for 
		shower, soap, and towel is the charge. No quesrtion that we got our 
		money’s worth with just one limitation. They passed a counterfeit 80 
		lira piece as change, not revealed until we tried to pay for lunch.<br>
		<br>These Italians are apparently adept at this trade, so we intend to 
		learn quickly and be careful from here on. I suppose the game is that 
		over the next month we will have the opportunityh to pass, in Italina 
		style, our 8 iira note to someone else who then will keeep the cycle 
		going.<br><br>Ted has told you of our “wonderful” hotel.., so I won’t 
		elaborate. Our stupendous breakfast of tea was stowed away in no time at 
		all. We are ready to get going this morning. Unfortunately, the day 
		dawned cloudy and stayed that way, dooming fine photos. American Express 
		was our first stop as usual. where we made inquiries and reduced our 
		Letter of Credit by $10 Outside, the newspapers are making a great deal 
		of an affair in Abbysinia, still not clear to us.<br><br>It was at 
		American Express that Bob Bssom offered to help us with our erands. He 
		is from Clevland, studying the language at the univwersity on a 
		schlorship and is in his ewigth month. He seemed just as glad to speak 
		with someone from home as we are to receive his guidance.which, to 
		begin, promised a fine day ahead of sight seeing. Since coming here he 
		has talked to few Americans for his desite to perfect his IItalian has 
		restricted conversation to Italian friends.<br><br>Our next call was the 
		American Consulate on Via Balbi, narrow and busy with busses, street 
		cars, and crowds of pedestrians. Very few cars are seen because gasoline 
		starts at $2 a gallon and even the wealthy can afford only 4 cylinder 
		Fiats. Our journey took us down even darker Via Caerelli, followed by 
		Via Garibaldi, leading into Piazza Corridoni and the Consulate.<br><br>
		After registering our passport, our steps took us to Piazza Ferrari, the 
		town center. A few more steps and we were on Via Vente Setembre, a date 
		similar to our Fourth of July. It is the finest street in Genoa. At CIT 
		we cashed 350 mlira from our Letter of Credit, and then were ready to 
		see the sughts.<br><br>Don had a class at 11:30 so we arranged to meet 
		him again in an hour, giving us time to to get the wondrous shower at 
		the Doccia. Don took us to a quaint restaurant , small and warm, its 
		walls covered with works of art, and each table had its standard bottle 
		of red and white wine. We thoroughly enjoyed a delicious lunch of 
		macaroni, meat, spinach, fruit, and bread. The wine completed the 
		Genoese atmosphere. Just say “macaroni” and roll the “r’s” and you will 
		experince a bit of the joy of a meal here. With the new feeling of 
		something solid beneath our belts, it was time for sight seeing.<br><br>
		Our greatest wish was to see the birthplace of Columbus. It lay just a 
		few blocks away at one picturesque entrance to the “Old Town”. As we 
		crossed Piazza Ferrari, officers and their men strutted by, all in 
		dashing colorful uniforms. Their white gloves and equally white ”bobby” 
		hats identified them as Carbonieri. They are the city police whot 
		directs traffic with the flick of a finger. exuding confidence and 
		authority. They must have practiced before mirrors in order toi sustain 
		such compusure with minmal effort as wild traffic responds to their 
		motions.<br><br>At one corner of the square, a crowd gazed admiringly at 
		a one-man tank, exhibiteed as a part of the Ethiopian Campagne. It seems 
		as if a victory is taking place every day, for “extras” art the curb 
		side constantly headline success.<br><br>Don jibed, “I bet you will pass 
		Columbus’ home and not notice it”. He was right when this did happen as 
		Donn led us on. A single square two-storied stone structure, almost 
		entirely covered with vines, was all we could see. But any doubts we had 
		were quickly dispelled on approaching closer. A plaque in Latin 
		establishes this as his home. It stands starkly all alone on the street 
		corner, adjacent structures having been removed. We were surprised that 
		the Genoa governament had not done more to glorify this monument, 
		especially on hearing from Don that his Genoese classmates take great 
		pride that Columbus is of their blood. When the going gets tough for 
		Don, as his classmates rib him with debt the Ameicans owe the Genoese, 
		he turns the argument around with a few words as he points out that it 
		took the Spanish to make his success a reality. Occasionally, flushed 
		faces and slight flashes of Italian anbger result.<br><br>The Old City 
		is one of Genoa’s most intriguing sights, and one of the few left in 
		large cities.The midieval wall and battlements are now being rebuilt, 
		for they completely surround the original city. Smart shops with 
		stunning ultra modern window displays seem out of place in †he narrow 
		dark alleys of the “Old Town”.<br><br>Everyday is wash day here, for 
		clothes lines fly thir drying colorful garments like pennants from five 
		and six story windows in otherwise plain buildings packed tightly 
		together. Almost no light filters through to the streets or alleys 
		below. We jostled back and forth through slowly moving crowds, stepping 
		aside now and then as a giant wine barrel, surely empty, is rolled by as 
		it takes up almost the entire passage way.<br><br>It was in the center 
		of such a section that we came upon the Cathedral, largest and finest of 
		Genoese churches. It was our introduction to the masterpieces we expect 
		to see throuout all of Italy. What struck us most about this 
		architecture is the use of broad stripes on the facade in black and 
		white marble, and used as well, inside.This is more like what we would 
		expect in the Near East as a probable hang-over from the Byzantines at 
		the time whwn Constantine was gaining a foothold in Ravenna.<br><br>
		Columns, also of Byzantine origin, seem out of harmony as they stand 
		between the stately Roman pillars. Frescoed ceilings, and walls 
		barocquelly trimmed with gold, towered above us as we stood on the 
		expansive main floor, aghast at at the immensity and richness of 
		everything. Ornate alters are set in small alcove that line the nave. 
		One characteristic of all these great churches is that all the seating 
		is in small chairs easily moved. They thus may be cleared for 
		processions so often demanded on special days. How tiny these seats and 
		the people sitting in them appear in the great hall.<br><br>In order to 
		see a little of the grandeur that once was Genoa, we visited two of the 
		many palaces scattered through the city. Today they are primarily rented 
		to banks where 20th Century business affairs are the rule, hard and 
		practical, and perhaps softened by still fresh remindes of a turbulent 
		past. It’s hard to believe, but there are still palaces everywhere, 
		constructed with beautiful many-colored marbles from nearby Carrara at 
		the foot of the Alps. Even these semi-precious stones are frescoed from 
		top to bottom. The artists, even in that early times, were masters of 
		perspective. Flat exteriors give the appearance of rows of ornate 
		collonades, pillars standing out in relief, these masterpices of art as 
		commonplace as nearby modern lastered surfaces. A fresco, you know, is a 
		painting done on wet cement The dyes are given time to . In this way 
		they will last. Great skill is necessary to do this work, for a single 
		slip utterly ruins the work. Just imagine three and four stories covered 
		with this workmanship!<br><br>Each great palace has its main entrance 
		through forbidding steel doors. Just inside is the courtyard with the 
		ever present ornamental and active fountain. Only the privileged wealthy 
		could have a fountain in those days because the water had to come by 
		aqueduct and then piped in to each palace.The court is usally square and 
		fully enclosed by the palace. Today, the residences looking down on the 
		courtyard appear plain and just dreary from the outside, but their truly 
		gorgeous well-preserved interiors in so many cases give full testimony 
		to the pagentry once a norm in the old world. You can’t possibly 
		understand what it must have been like without just standing and gawking 
		at these monuments of the past.<br><br>In Palazzo Tussi, now the Palazzo 
		Municipale, we were shown the through room after room , frescoed, with 
		worn tapestries, and finely wrought furnisshings. These rooms once 
		belonged to the great Doria family, whose maritime influence was felt 
		throughout not only Italy but the world. Great wooden doors swing on 
		massive hinges, the lower one always the larger and stronger, so that 
		the doors swing in at an angle as though opening upwards too. Priceless 
		paintings cover every wall. Baroque ceiling frescoes look down on gilded 
		objects of art. It is in such a room that govenment officers today meet 
		to discuss weighty problems.<br><br>If one lived in such a place very 
		long, and appreciated the surroiundings, jus t tooking up should produce 
		a perenial stiff neck. Paganini’s violin is just one of the treasures, 
		kept under lock an key behind glass on a royal red and gold stand.<br>
		<br>Manicured gardens lie on each side of this palace, perhaps a little 
		stiff and formal to our eyes, but appreciated if only for the stories 
		they tell. What color, gaity, joys and tragedies of life must have been 
		the lots for the few privileged in such surroundings when Genoa was in 
		its hayday, its fleets competing with those of Genoa, Pisa, and Venice, 
		and bringing treasures from east and west. Genoa was a and perhaps the 
		center for great art in the 17th century as it attracted the works of 
		artist such as Rubens, Van Dyke, and Rembrandt, for all worked here at 
		times as they created the masterpices to adorn walls and halls of a 
		Doria, Gataldi, or a Podesta palace. <br><br>In Palazzo (pronounded 
		Palatzo) Roseo, one of the finest preserved palaces, we walked 
		reverantly over marble floors and though sumtious rooms, admiring the 
		art of Van Dyke, his colors still fresh while those of Ruberns are 
		darkening with age. But for the most part the northern artists were not 
		able to make their colors last as long as those of the Italian masters. 
		Draperies, porcelain, and exotic wood carvings are everwhere here.<br>
		<br>Quite a contrast was the view from the third story window of the 
		palace. A sea of house tops engulfed us. This is the tenemant district. 
		Each almost unattractive structure is topped by a penthouse. something 
		New York is just iscovering. Every house top also has a vegetbale 
		garden, wash on the clothes line, cats roaming about, and plain dull 
		gray slate roof without the pleasant tiles common to the French Riviera. 
		Genoa is noted for this grayness. Sate quarries are nearby and the 
		material cheap. Of course the inevitable old man frequents many of these 
		penthouse gardens, and is puttering around there. In the distance, 
		glistening domes and majestic spires rise above the drabness. With these 
		clashing views of wealth and poverty in our minds, we left the Red 
		Palace and contemplatively walked beneath shadows of departed glory 
		along the Palace-lined Via Garibaldi. “Departd gory”<br><br>included our 
		hotel room, which Ted is writing about. ”:Marie” in a high shrill voice 
		will ring in our ears for daysa to come. We are thinking of compiling a 
		“Slap Me Down”-places recommended to be avoided, our Genoa abode 
		reserving first position.<br><br>This Genoa story is finally completed, 
		four days behind schedule. I can now go to sleep. Tomorrow we visit St. 
		Peters and surely it will be a great reat thrill to then be desribed to 
		you, are loved ones at home. We hope a our thoughhts, feelings, in words

		things we never imagined except perhaps in our perception of Vatican 
		treasures and even fairy tales. We have enjoyed an honest to goodness 
		hot shower in a spic and span tile bathroom below Piazza Aquivardini in 
		one of Italy’s many Docias, or public baths. What a glorious feeling to 
		be really shining new after a day of pedaling.<br><br>Four lira for 
		shower, soap, and towel is the charge. No question that we got our 
		money’s worth with just one limitation. They passed a counterfeit 80 
		lira piece as change, not revealed until we tried to pay for lunch.<br>
		<br>These Italians are apparently adept at this trade, so we intend to 
		learn quickly and be careful from here on. I suppose the game is that 
		over the next month we will have the opportunity to pass, in Italina 
		style, our 8 iira note to someone else who then will keep the cycle 
		going.<br><br>Ted has told you of our “wonderful” hotel.., so I won’t 
		elaborate. Our stupendous breakfast of tea was stowed away in no time at 
		all. We are ready to get going this morning. Unfortunately, the day 
		dawned cloudy and stayed that way, dooming fine photos. American Express 
		was our first stop as usual. where we made inquiries and reduced our 
		Letter of Credit by $10 Outside, the newspapers are making a great deal 
		of an affair in Abbysinia, still not clear to us.<br><br>It was at 
		American Express that Bob Bssom offered to help us with our erands. He 
		is from Clevland, studying the language at the univwersity on a 
		schlorship and is in his eighth month. He seemed just as glad to speak 
		with someone from home as we are to receive his guidance.which, to 
		begin, promised a fine day ahead of sight seeing. Since coming here he 
		has talked to few Americans for his desire to perfect his Italian has 
		restricted conversation to Italian friends.<br><br>Our next call was the 
		American Consulate on Via Balbi, narrow and busy with busses, street 
		cars, and crowds of pedestrians. Very few cars are seen because gasoline 
		starts at $2 a gallon and even the wealthy can afford only 4 cylinder 
		Fiats. Our journey took us down even darker Via Caerelli, followed by 
		Via Garibaldi, leading into Piazza Corridoni and the Consulate.<br><br>
		After registering our passport, our steps took us to Piazza Ferrari, the 
		town center. A few more steps and we were on Via Vente Setembre, a date 
		similar to our Fourth of July. It is the finest street in Genoa. At CIT 
		we cashed 350 mlira from our Letter of Credit, and then were ready to 
		see the sights.<br><br>Don had a class at 11:30 so we arranged to meet 
		him again in an hour, giving us time to to get the wondrous shower at 
		the Doccia. Don took us to a quaint restaurant , small and warm, its 
		walls covered with works of art, and each table had its standard bottle 
		of red and white wine. We thoroughly enjoyed a delicious lunch of 
		macaroni, meat, spinach, fruit, and bread. The wine completed the 
		Genoese atmosphere. Just say “macaroni” and roll the “r’s” and you will 
		experience a bit of the joy of a meal here. With the new feeling of 
		something solid beneath our belts, it was time for sight seeing.<br><br>
		Our greatest wish was to see the birthplace of Columbus. It lay just a 
		few blocks away at one picturesque entrance to the “Old Town”. As we 
		crossed Piazza Ferrari, officers and their men strutted by, all in 
		dashing colorful uniforms. Their white gloves and equally white ”bobby” 
		hats identified them as Carbonieri. They are the city police who direct 
		traffic with the flick of a finger. exuding confidence and authority. 
		They must have practiced before mirrors in order to sustain such 
		composure with minimal effort as wild traffic responds to their motions.<br>
		<br>At one corner of the square, a crowd gazed admiringly at a one-man 
		tank, exhibited as a part of the Ethiopian Campagne. It seems as if a 
		victory is taking place every day, for “extras” art the curb side 
		constantly headline success.<br><br>Don jibed, “I bet you will pass 
		Columbus’ home and not notice it”. He was right when this did happen as 
		Donn led us on. A single square two-storied stone structure, almost 
		entirely covered with vines, was all we could see. But any doubts we had 
		were quickly dispelled on approaching closer. A plaque in Latin 
		establishes this as his home. It stands starkly all alone on the street 
		corner, adjacent structures having been removed. We were surprised that 
		the Genoa government had not done more to glorify this monument, 
		especially on hearing from Don that his Genoese classmates take great 
		pride that Columbus is of their blood. When the going gets tough for 
		Don, as his classmates rib him with debt the Americans owe the Genoese, 
		he turns the argument around with a few words as he points out that it 
		took the Spanish to make his success a reality. Occasionally, flushed 
		faces and slight flashes of Italian anbger result.<br><br>The Old City 
		is one of Genoa’s most intriguing sights, and one of the few left in 
		large cities. The medieval wall and battlements are now being rebuilt, 
		for they completely surround the original city. Smart shops with 
		stunning ultra modern window displays seem out of place in †he narrow 
		dark alleys of the “Old Town”.<br><br>Everyday is wash day here, for 
		clothes lines fly their drying colorful garments like pennants from five 
		and six story windows in otherwise plain buildings packed tightly 
		together. Almost no light filters through to the streets or alleys 
		below. We jostled back and forth through slowly moving crowds, stepping 
		aside now and then as a giant wine barrel, surely empty, is rolled by as 
		it takes up almost the entire passage way.<br><br>It was in the center 
		of such a section that we came upon the Cathedral, largest and finest of 
		Genoese churches. It was our introduction to the masterpieces we expect 
		to see throw-out all of Italy. What struck us most about this 
		architecture is the use of broad stripes on the facade in black and 
		white marble, and used as well, inside. This is more like what we would 
		expect in the Near East as a probable hang-over from the Byzantines at 
		the time when Constantine was gaining a foothold in Ravenna.<br><br>
		Columns, also of Byzantine origin, seem out of harmony as they stand 
		between the stately Roman pillars. Frescoed ceilings, and walls 
		barocquelly trimmed with gold, towered above us as we stood on the 
		expansive main floor, aghast at at the immensity and richness of 
		everything. Ornate alters are set in small alcove that line the nave. 
		One characteristic of all these great churches is that all the seating 
		is in small chairs easily moved. They thus may be cleared for 
		processions so often demanded on special days. How tiny these seats and 
		the people sitting in them appear in the great hall.<br><br>In order to 
		see a little of the grandeur that once was Genoa, we visited two of the 
		many palaces scattered through the city. Today they are primarily rented 
		to banks where 20th Century business affairs are the rule, hard and 
		practical, and perhaps softened by still fresh reminds of a turbulent 
		past. It’s hard to believe, but there are still palaces everywhere, 
		constructed with beautiful many-colored marbles from nearby Carrara at 
		the foot of the Alps. Even these semi-precious stones are frescoed from 
		top to bottom. The artists, even in that early times, were masters of 
		perspective. Flat exteriors give the appearance of rows of ornate 
		colonnades, pillars standing out in relief, these masterpieces of art as 
		commonplace as nearby modern lastered surfaces. A fresco, you know, is a 
		painting done on wet cement The dyes are given time to . In this way 
		they will last. Great skill is necessary to do this work, for a single 
		slip utterly ruins the work. Just imagine three and four stories covered 
		with this workmanship!<br><br>Each great palace has its main entrance 
		through forbidding steel doors. Just inside is the courtyard with the 
		ever present ornamental and active fountain. Only the privileged wealthy 
		could have a fountain in those days because the water had to come by 
		aqueduct and then piped in to each palace. The court is usually square 
		and fully enclosed by the palace. Today, the residences looking down on 
		the courtyard appear plain and just dreary from the outside, but their 
		truly gorgeous well-preserved interiors in so many cases give full 
		testimony to the pageantry once a norm in the old world. You can’t 
		possibly understand what it must have been like without just standing 
		and gawking at these monuments of the past.<br><br>In Palazzo Tussi, now 
		the Palazzo Municipale, we were shown the through room after room , 
		frescoed, with worn tapestries, and finely wrought furnishings. These 
		rooms once belonged to the great Doria family, whose maritime influence 
		was felt throughout not only Italy but the world. Great wooden doors 
		swing on massive hinges, the lower one always the larger and stronger, 
		so that the doors swing in at an angle as though opening upwards too. 
		Priceless paintings cover every wall. Baroque ceiling frescoes look down 
		on gilded objects of art. It is in such a room that government officers 
		today meet to discuss weighty problems.<br><br>If one lived in such a 
		place very long, and appreciated the surroundings, just looking up 
		should produce a perennial stiff neck. Paganini’s violin is just one of 
		the treasures, kept under lock an key behind glass on a royal red and 
		gold stand.<br><br>Manicured gardens lie on each side of this palace, 
		perhaps a little stiff and formal to our eyes, but appreciated if only 
		for the stories they tell. What color, gaity, joys and tragedies of life 
		must have been the lots for the few privileged in such surroundings when 
		Genoa was in its hayday, its fleets competing with those of Genoa, Pisa, 
		and Venice, and bringing treasures from east and west. Genoa was a and 
		perhaps the center for great art in the 17th century as it attracted the 
		works of artist such as Rubens, Van Dyke, and Rembrandt, for all worked 
		here at times as they created the masterpieces to adorn walls and halls 
		of a Doria, Gataldi, or a Podesta palace. <br><br>In Palazzo (pronounced 
		Palatzo) Roseo, one of the finest preserved palaces, we walked 
		reverently over marble floors and though sumptuous rooms, admiring the 
		art of Van Dyke, his colors still fresh while those of Ruberns are 
		darkening with age. But for the most part the northern artists were not 
		able to make their colors last as long as those of the Italian masters. 
		Draperies, porcelain, and exotic wood carvings are everywhere here.<br>
		<br>Quite a contrast was the view from the third story window of the 
		palace. A sea of house tops engulfed us. This is the tenement district. 
		Each almost unattractive structure is topped by a penthouse. something 
		New York is just discovering. Every house top also has a vegetable 
		garden, wash on the clothes line, cats roaming about, and plain dull 
		gray slate roof without the pleasant tiles common to the French Riviera. 
		Genoa is noted for this grayness. Sate quarries are nearby and the 
		material cheap. Of course the inevitable old man frequents many of these 
		penthouse gardens, and is puttering around there. In the distance, 
		glistening domes and majestic spires rise above the drabness. With these 
		clashing views of wealth and poverty in our minds, we left the Red 
		Palace and contemplatively walked beneath shadows of departed glory 
		along the Palace-lined Via Garibaldi. “Departd gory”<br><br>included our 
		hotel room, which Ted is writing about. ”:Marie” in a high shrill voice 
		will ring in our ears for daysa to come. We are thinking of compiling a 
		“Slap Me Down”-places recommended to be avoided, our Genoa abode 
		reserving first position.<br><br>This Genoa story is finally completed, 
		four days behind schedule. I can now go to sleep. Tomorrow we visit St. 
		Peters and surely it will be a great reat thrill to then be described to 
		you, are loved ones at home. We hope a our thoughts, feelings, in words 
		make this real for you too, Mom, Dad, and Bruce, and hope Ching is 
		listening as well. Love Dick.# 14..Pisa April 28..Ted<br><br>Just a few 
		words about Genoa. I must tell you about our hotel. As we were told 
		later by our friend Bob Bassom, we are poor hotel-pickers for our 
		lodging was in the worst part of town. It was near the station. and 
		reasonable, and for the moment looked all right. The first annoying 
		incident was the taking of our passports to fill out the forms for the 
		police, but the proprietors manner of doing so was odd. We were becoming 
		nervous and wary. The people who run the restaurant and rooms where we 
		slept are a very unhappy pair, always yelling at each other. The wife, 
		much too heavy, would scream at the waitress, “Muriel, Muriel” and then 
		followed a string words with a nasty tone.<br><br>Our room seemed clean 
		and large but on our first day the maid kept busting through our door, 
		always looking for someone in the household. We never found who she was 
		looking for. At 6: 30 AM the ringing of loud bells in the church next 
		door was anything but welcome. Potentially, the view could have been 
		quite wonderful, but the unkept street below with inhabitants equally 
		shabby left a bad taste in our mouths. Dinner and breakfast were no 
		better. Dick said he had never before tasted undercooked horsehide. And 
		I couldn’t argue. The bread was the shattering sort that easily takes 
		away one’s appetite. That’s enough of a description of our first living 
		lesson in Italy. <br><br>Our plan ws to see the famous city cemetery and 
		the ride to Rapello along the coast. The cemetery was quite a way out 
		but well worth our while. The tomb of Mazzini is accompanied by many 
		magnificent mausoleums. It was like walking in a sea of marble homes. 
		Family coats of arms adorn each doorway. And some of the tombs are 
		miniatures of the Milan Cathedral.<br><br>By this time it was, of 
		course, beginning to rain so we stopped at a Lattoria and had a cup of 
		chocolate, two fried eggs, and a loaf of fluffy bread. It was 
		refreshing.<br><br>It really was raining by this time so we decided that 
		the train must be taken, although we would miss the remarkable coast 
		line.<br><br>This morning we arose with a sigh of relief to be on our 
		way gain. Genoa has been much more of a positive experience, thanks to 
		Bob Bossom, than we had counted on. It was beginning to rain again so we 
		stopped at a milk shop or “lateria” and had a cup of chocolate, two 
		fried eggs, accompanied by a loaf of wor fluffy bread. Things were 
		picking up as our needed diet came within range of our budget.<br><br>It 
		was really pouring as we stepped out. It was clear that today the train 
		was the only way to go. Our bicycles were safely tagged for Rome. We 
		would not need them in small Pisa, and had confidence in a railroad 
		system seeming equal to the quality of Doccas. This man Mussolini seems 
		to be in firm control, and yet not oppressive to the people or to 
		visitors such a two American boys far from home.<br><br>Yet for anyone 
		who hopes to see the country, even on a sunny day, the train is not the 
		way to go. Tunnels are so numerous that the trip is spoiled. However, an 
		electric train has its plusses, for traversing the many tunnels is 
		smokeless.<br><br>Views of small towns such as Nervi, Rappello, and 
		Portofino, most famous of Italian Riviera resorts, were much too short 
		and the rain dimmed the views between tunnels. Thus we will never know 
		what we have missed, but I am sure it was our loss. The coast is very 
		irregular, and on a good day just a glimpse of these fishing towns must 
		be a joy, but from that point on he coast was dull, finally becoming 
		almost bare. Then the tunnels suddenly ceased, and we were skirting the 
		Apuan Alps with huge marble quarries appearing as snow drifts in the 
		mountains.<br><br>A bit further, in the town of Avensa, we had a fine 
		view of a colossal fourteenth century chateau wherein is supposed to be 
		a huge bust of the artist Mazzini. Vineyards, almost always rectangular,<br>
		<br>were bounded with vegetable gardens outlined with arbors supporting 
		more vines. Yellow lilies and red poppies seemed to be growing freely 
		along the side of the tracks. Two natives were our companions in our 
		four person compartment typical of continental trains. They had the 
		window seats, never looked out, and just consumed tempting lunches under 
		our noses. The two others were a couple, either German of Swiss, 
		evidently tourists going to Rome<br><br>When it was time Dick and I got 
		knapsacks ready and could stand in the vestibule where we had the thrill 
		of seeing the Tower we had seen so often in postcards. It seemed to take 
		hours before the train finally stopped, and quickly we were at a hotel 
		to deposit our baggage. Quickly we were on the way to the Tower of Pisa, 
		the Cathedral, the Baptistry and the Compesante, all in a group at the 
		northeast side of the city.<br><br>Pisa has 75,000 residents and it is 
		divided into equal parts by the legendary river Arno. All through the 
		city are run down palaces, last vestiges of powerful days. Pisa is the 
		birthplace of perhaps the most renowned man in Italian history, Galilee 
		Galali. astronomer without peer, and Nicolo Pisano, tutor of Leonardo Da 
		Vinci. Pisa as with so many Italian cities has a glorious history. 
		Probably first settled by the Greeks, it underwent domination by first 
		the Ligurians, then the Etruscans , and much later the Romans. During 
		the Middle Ages it was a maritime power, along with Genoa and Venice. It 
		must then have been much closer to the sea. The Republic of Pisa fought 
		against the a saracens, and for a time was mistress of Sardinia, a part 
		of Corsica, and the Balearic Isles. In fact the Pisan fleet was defeated 
		by the Genoese, thus beginning the city’s decline. The downward trend 
		continued until 1509 and despite the heroism of the citizens, Pisa 
		became subservient to Florence. Now all she has is her history, frescoes 
		and human ureters of names off a few famous sons.<br><br>As I said we 
		were anxious to get to the Tower. And when we did come in sight of it , 
		we weren't the least disappointed. It is breathtaking. The Cathedral 
		stands close by, and just beyond is the Baptistry. We started with the 
		Baptistry, built in the 12th century, circular and imposing. We entered 
		through the main door and found ourselves in a single room the shape of 
		a dome. In the center is the basin for total immersion, inlaid with 
		colorful marble. The pulpit by Nicole Pisano is quite wonderful, also of 
		course in marble. While we were admiring the pulpit, two men and a guide 
		entered, the guide evidently a friend of the two, for he began to chant, 
		one note after another in a harmonic chord. The first note ws loud and 
		clear, the second a bit softer, and the third just enough to be audible 
		and round out the full and beautiful full chord it then echoing and 
		reechoing around us. The construction of the dome was so articulate as 
		to make this musical rendering possible. Wonder of wonders?<br><br>
		Across the lawn and through the drizzle we walked to the Cathedral. Our 
		interest focused on the bronze lamp that is so famous as the Lamp off 
		Galilee, for it was the oscillations of this lamp that formed the basis 
		for Galilee's discovery of the pendulum and its relation to the earth’s 
		motion and gravity. It hangs centrally in the nave.<br><br>After a look 
		around at the rest of the interior with its supply of great artists’ 
		work, we went to the Tower, paid a small admission fee, and started the 
		climb to the top. This was just plain fun for on the lower, or hanging 
		side, the climbing was easy, while on the other side the steps seemed to 
		be three feet high, all due to the angle of the lean. After five minutes 
		of climbing we were at the top and looking over the lower rim to the 
		ground below. It was there that I asked myself why suicides are so 
		plentiful in New York when on could get some real publicity here and not 
		even have to jump, just lean. Vision through the rain was poor, so we 
		didn’t have the joy of seeing a countryside so pictured in art and 
		postcards. It was getting late so so retuned to our hotel-pension for a 
		tasty dinner before bed.<br><br>APRIL 30 IN ROME<br><br>This is our 
		first day in Rome and we have never realized it would b such a thrill 
		This morning we made he acquaintance of an American lady who has lived 
		here for many years , and because Dick is in such dire need of pants, 
		she offered to find a tailor. Dick is constantly checking behind to be 
		sure there is not another opening there, The tailor will be here 
		tonight. This morning we had our first glimpse of the Coliseum, Pantheon 
		and the Forum, So we started with the Pantheism, so familiar it is in 
		our history books It is all it is supposed to be. The dome quite 
		unbelievable for its size and height, all in concrete , surprisingly. 
		Miss Gallagher, our new knowledgeable friend, said that the outside had 
		been originally covered with brass plates and the inner surfaces with 
		marble. Further she commented that many who have suffered for their 
		faith consider lt a disgrace that pagan temples such as this one have 
		not been preserved more perfectly. And we ask why these people who have 
		suffered would even wish to preserve these monument at all. This was a 
		temple to the gods where each god had a niche for itself, and now they 
		are replaced by smaller statues relating to Christianity, At one side is 
		the tomb of Raphael and opposite the tombs of two Italian monarchism 
		Emmanuel I and II. The only ventilation is through the large opening in 
		the center of the dome admitting light The Pantheon was said to have ben 
		built by Agrippa, but there is more reason to believe that when he added 
		the portico and a few columns, his name took hold. As we walked out, 
		again a glimpse of the Coliseum was there to thrill us.<br><br>Miss 
		Gallagher then pointed out palaces , showing us a few still in use as 
		such, while most are considered liabilities and are used for stores and 
		apartments. On our way to the Pantheon we had passed through the Piazza 
		Venezia which is dominated by the Vittorio Emanuel Monument, and on the 
		right side is the building wherein Mussolini has apartments. He makes 
		his appearances on his balcony overlooking the square.<br><br>Our next 
		visit, as with all tourists, was to the Trevi Fountain where if you toss 
		in a coin, you will return, just as in Honolulu where by tossing a coin 
		for the divers, you too will assure a return. Therefore, our last 
		evening here we plan to make offerings in order to return and with a 
		single contribution minimize our losses.<br><br>But this is not all we 
		saw this morning. We were led into a small church that was the chapel 
		for the Doria family, so prominent here, and where, also, Napoleon’s 
		brother and his wife are buried. Below this building is the dungeon of 
		St. Paul. A few steps away we entered the Jesuit University Chapel, with 
		its magnificent interior. In one of the transcripts rests the tomb of 
		Saint Aloysius, patron saint of young manhood.<br><br>Just a word about 
		churches in general . We will try to be succinct about the virtues of 
		each because the details are repetitious and go on for pages. Dick and I 
		have said that of all of the five hundred or more churches here, one 
		side of one chapel would provide ample thrill for a lifetime.<br><br>We 
		nest entered another church, Santa Maria Sopra Minerva, erected on the 
		ruins of the pagan Temple of Minerva. High mass was going on, and you 
		can imagine the fiery land of candles. Michelanglo’s Risen Christ with 
		the Cross stands to the left of the tribune with the right foot 
		protected by a bronze shoe to withstand the kisses of the devout. On our 
		way out Miss Gallagher pointed out to us the difference beaten good and 
		bad sculpture. One was hard and unnatural, the other soft with fine 
		proportions. We learned that the capitals of the doric columns are 
		derived from the the Acanthus leaf that grows throughout the land. In 
		the plaza, pronounced platza, in front of this church is a rather odd 
		monument consisting of a marble elephant supporting an Egyptian obelisk. 
		The reason for this design is that the obelisk, though beautiful, was 
		too small and needed to be raised to be appreciated.<br><br>After our 
		morning of education, we returned and put a way a good lunch, part of 
		which consisted of a heaped plate of spaghetti.The main attraction for 
		the afternoon was our inspection of the Palazzo del Quirinale. Since 
		1870, it has ben the home of the King of italy, he displacing the Popes 
		p;previously their owners. It is on a hilltop with full view of Rome 
		including the dome of St. Peters. of course the marvelously uniformed 
		guards with Carabinieri colors, sashes, medals, breast bands and all are 
		at the door to silently greet us. The palace is as all palaces should be 
		with room after room of gilt, freezes, art masterpieces, plush rugs, and 
		striking colors such as yellow used quite beautifully. After the show we 
		easily joined the real world again, hiking back to the pension not for 
		away. We had intended to ride to the catacombs, although it was a little 
		late, so on our bikes rode past the Coliseum, to the Via Appia as it 
		starts out at the Porto San Sebastiano. There the Way continues as 
		cobblestones. The day was poor, the bumping not well tolerated, and it 
		was late, so we backed off to save the trip for another day. We rode for 
		awhile by fields of red poppies and scattered ruins, making the circuit 
		back to the city, and headed for shelter as again rain began.<br><br>We 
		had a good dinner and then learned of the evening’s plans. One of our 
		pension friends was making up a party to go to a wine restaurant for 
		some fun. We were invited, dutch-treat of course. At 9:30 we started and 
		didn’t get back until 1AM. What a night! Our party consisted of the 
		lawyer friend, Mr. Gionannini, who headed the party, two art students, 
		Mr. and Mrs Mac Kinney, Lauren and a very interesting Scotchman just 
		finishing a three year scholarship for travel in three European 
		countries, Miss Gallagher, and the two of us. We walked quite a way to 
		the Restaurant Biblioteca. Down a short staircase we found ourselves in 
		a wine cellar, the walls housing the bottles. We were seated, surrounded 
		with others obviously enjoying themselves The call went out for orders 
		and sweet wine sounded good to us, but we later found the dry wine was 
		the best. Musicians supplied popular songs and we sang lustily with the 
		rest. Dad would have been in his element. Soon eyelids began to droop 
		and we sang “:Show me the way to go home:” And another day was done as 
		we walked home through the maze of narrow streets. Ted<br><br><br>Rome 
		May 4 Rome Dick<br><br><br><br>The title of today’s epistle is “What a 
		difference a day makes”. Today has been the best so far in Italy, 
		forteling more to come, we hope. Everything seems to take on a healthier 
		aspect when Old Man Sol shows up, and then we see beauty all about, 
		largely unrecognized in the rain and mist. Bad weather has dogged our 
		footsteps this far. Hopefully we are due some blue skies when we enter 
		the Forum Romanum<br><br>We eagerly climbed out of bed this morning. I 
		rolled out to the starboard for mine lists. Enthusiastically we prepared 
		for our ride to Tivoli, Hardian’s Villa, and the Villa d’Este with its 
		pools and waterfalls. Ted had the cook make us a lunch and it was in our 
		hands in jig time. Things outside were again looking threatening, and we 
		were not anxious for another bath on wheels. After due deliberation the 
		project was discarded in favpr of a safe and sure excursion to the 
		Catacombs, Appian Way, and Forum Romanum. What really decided the issue 
		is the problem with my pants, now becoming just a shadow, so thin is the 
		seat. Just one more day and one more patch, but what do we do about the 
		box lunch? If we were to be any where near our pension, we would not 
		wish to miss the meal. There was nothing to do but, no matter the early 
		hour, sit down and eat right now-4 ham sandwiches, 2 oranges, 2 buns, 
		and 3 eggs we saved from yesterday’s breakfast. These refreshments put 
		the Lyons in the pink of condition for the ride to the catacombs and Via 
		Appia Anticus.<br><br>This day is the anniversary of the finding of the 
		cross by St. Helena, mother of Emperor Constantine. It was brought home 
		and is now held in parts in different countries, St. Peter’s having 
		custody of the largest section. Each year on this Sunday a procession 
		visits each of the great churches, starting early in the morning and 
		finishing up in Santa Maria Maggiore in the evening. Rome is divided 
		into four parishes and each year each parish has its day. This is the 
		day when the priest and train from his church, followed by a colorful 
		line of children and elders, visits each “shut in” in the parish and 
		administers the Holy Sacrament. This Sunday happens to be our parish’s 
		day. As we left for the catacombs, we came on to the procession moving 
		down the street. The head of the church and shaded by a rich canopy, was 
		the focal point of the procession, preceded and followed also by girls, 
		all ages, in white from head to foot in what might have been mothers’ 
		bridal gowns. They carried glowing candles. Boys dressed in black, 
		escorted by priests in black and white with blue and red crosses on 
		their chests, followed, and then came the adults. All were singing and 
		shouting in unision, repeating Latin responses as the procession would 
		stop before a house, the priest entering to perform his duties. We 
		enjoyed many intertainin<br><br>g minutes, and were especially aware of 
		the zeal guiding them.<br><br>Our ride to the Catacombs took some 
		minutes as we pedaled by the Coliseum and the Baths of Caracalla to the 
		point just beyond where the Appian Way begins, However, the pavement was 
		the same as that in Rome, dissipating the illusion that the Via is 
		intact from its the start of its days of marching Legions We went up and 
		down, as the avenue, lined by walls on both sides, gradually climbed to 
		disappear over rolling hills.<br><br>There are several sets of Catacombs 
		on the Via Appia, but we were told to visit St. Calixtus as the most t 
		interesting and instructive. St. Sebastian is the next in line.<br><br>A 
		little about Catacomb history first. In Rome’s pagan days when 
		Christians were being persecuted and martyred, a place was necessary to 
		hold services and bury their dead. Because the Romans had great respect 
		for the bodies of the dead, a meeting place in the burial ground would 
		be ideal. There were several wealthy Romans who had great holding 
		outside of Rome, and as Christians offered their land for the church 
		use. At first, meetings were held in the fields, but as the Romans got 
		wind of this, something had to be done to create a new retreat. Tunnels, 
		the Catacombs, were dug beneath the fields-miles and miles of them with 
		twisting narrow corridors, supported by masonry and with shelves on 
		which the dead were laid. Meetings continued in these caverns, lit by 
		candles and aeriated through ingenious vents. Today, most of the bodies 
		have been removed, many when Rome was invaded by the “barbarians.” Aside 
		from many empty shelves, all is as it was. There are at least nineteen 
		miles of corridors in St. Calixtus alone. St Calixtus, ,himself, was the 
		caretaker It is an interesting fact that this catacomb was dug beneath 
		the land owned by St. Cecelias family, and she was buried here for many 
		years before being transferred to Rome.<br><br>The entrance to the 
		tunnels is in a beautiful verdant farmyard with colorful flowers, 
		spreading trees, and pigeons frolicking in the shade. Down an avenue to 
		the right we could see St. Peters, hazy as rain drops obscured the view.<br>
		<br>It was during these moments as we waited with brother Connoly, our 
		enthusiastic guide, that we were introduced to Mr. and Mrs Flannery, an 
		American couple hatless and camera in hand, and to a Mr. OConnel of the 
		famous Irish O’Connels, our first acquaintance with the genuine thing. 
		We had a long and highly productive chat with the Flannerys from 
		Pittsburgh resulting in an invitation to tea at their plush hotel. And 
		they will let us in even if in sweaters.<br><br>Steep stone steps led us 
		down into the Catacombs, its walls covered with a firm matting of ferns, 
		moss, grass and vines. Once down in the labyrinth, we encountered a 
		depth of darkness greater than we have ever experienced. The corridors 
		are 4 feet wide and 20 feet high, their sides cut out in shelves, the 
		length of the human body, short on that day. All are empty save for few 
		unmolested and closed with a marble slab inscribed in Latin. Plaques 
		with ancient inscriptions are attached to the walls, apparently placed 
		their in pieces after the ravages from the north. The channels climb and 
		dip and twist, stretching out in every direction so that we were soon 
		lost in the inky blackness. We wonder if they ever found the nuns who 
		had wandered away. Each of us held a flickering candle as our only 
		guide. Brother O’Connolly guided us without hesitation, rattling off 
		information and Latin inscriptions with machine-like precision. Ancient 
		vegetable oil paintings can still be seen on the crumbling plaster of 
		the many tiny chapels. How they have withstood the rigors of time here 
		is not understood. In one mortuary, carved marble sarcophagi contain the 
		dried bones open to be seen. The bodies had been wrapped in linen and 
		then sealed for the centuries. Religious signs, the fish and olive, are 
		prominent in many inscriptions. In the days of persecution the cross was 
		at times depicted in the form of an anchor, as was the Greek cross. Many 
		symbols are still not understood, And the a grave of a true martyr was 
		pointed out from time to time.<br><br>Brother O’Connolly closed our 
		visit with an invitation to return at 6 PM and he would take us through 
		portions not open to the public. We know we shall return if only to 
		enjoy our friend’s rich and exuberant spirit,<br><br>Back on the Via 
		Appia we again took up our search for the original pavements. It was a 
		mile or more before we found the first remains of the ancient 
		highway-stones rough and warn and laid haphazardly. Perhaps the spaces 
		between the stones were filled up with mortar during the days of the 
		Caesars, but now it is like riding over a river bed of boulders. This 
		road was certainly not built for bikes. Only patches of the original 
		road remain, but some are smooth enough to remind us of the glory days.<br>
		<br>The sun was now shining brightly, tuning the fields of wildflowers 
		into seas of reds and yellows. Ruins dotted the landscape. A great 
		aqueduct stretches out in the distance, unmoved from the day it drew 
		water into the fountains of Rome, The first recognizable roadside ruin 
		was the tower of Cecilia Marbela a circular fortress, we suspect, now 
		overgrown with weeds. At several points artists were catching the spirit 
		on canvas. On both sides of the highway, fractured statues , columns, 
		and what have been tombs. lie decaying, and in the shade they create, 
		picnicers are resting. The sight of this food reminded us of the hours 
		since we had eaten, so it was time to start for home. It was a long 
		pedal on the Via, through the gates of San Sebastian and the usual 
		arches to the Pension in time to enjoy a full Sunday dinner-chicken with 
		all of the “fixins,” although not quite in the southern manner. I 
		neglected to mention that the street decorations on this Parish Day 
		along the path of the procession were multicolored blankets hanging from 
		almost every balcony.<br><br>Our new Scottish friend had agreed to take 
		us to through the Ruins on the Palatine, providing his expertice in 
		Roman history. However, the MacKinneys held the stage after lunch so 
		that we couldn’t leave until 3 o’clock. Evenings are long and light slow 
		to leave so we still had time. We first walked by Trajan’s Forum and 
		learned a bit more looking down to inspect it, for it lies some 20 feet 
		below the present city’s level. Trajan’s C olumns that depict his 
		military victories are as high as the original hill from which the Forum 
		was cut. Only a few columns here and there remain. Caeser’s Forum was 
		much the same. There is no way I can fairly describe these entities 
		without extensive descriptions from history, and I leave that to the 
		books.<br><br>Our visit to he prison Mamertinus was one of the 
		highlights of the day, for this is the prison where Vercingetorix 
		perished and Peter and Paul were imprisoned before their executions. A 
		hole in the ceiling was the only inlet to the dungeons, and therefore 
		escape was impossible. The prison is just two stone cells, one resting 
		on the other. The famous prisoners were kept in the lower one.<br><br>
		There was no light, just dampness everywhere. In the lower cell is a 
		spring said to have appeared and enabled the Apostles to baptize their 
		jailers. There is an imprint on the wall said to tbe Peter/’s face, when 
		a jailer jammed him against the wall. However, since these rock walls 
		were solid, a human face could only be smashed against it, so we have 
		our doubts about the legend. These stories surely had color, 
		intensifying memories of what we see.<br><br>Forum Romanum, preeminent 
		of ruins, lies at the foot of the Palatine. and is just a mass of 
		crumbling buildings testifying to the glories that once was Rome. This 
		was our first visit and I will just list a few impressions, for we will 
		go back some evening just to sit and dream, imagining it as it was 
		centuries ago.<br><br>Today ivy and vines encircle everything, 
		increasing the feeling of antiquity, all magnified by silence. Great 
		white pillars, broken and marred, still stand serenely as part of the 
		ancient temples whose interior crumbling frescoes and mosaics resist 
		time. Inlaid marble floors, still beautiful; carvings still 
		recognizable; pools bordered by worn smooth statues; a great 
		amphitheater where foot and chariot races took place, and Christians 
		were martyred; statues ruined by the thoughtless signatures of 
		unappreciative visitors; the Arch of Titus still preserved, majestic, 
		sketches our first observations and thoughts. In the broken foundation 
		of what must have been a bank cooper coins, now green with age, lie 
		imbedded in the pavement, melted by the fire that destroyed the 
		structure. Our Scottish guide kept things lively with his humor as he 
		described experiences with the paid Forum guides. When asked about an 
		unrecognizable ruin, the answer is, if the name isn’t known, “It is the 
		Temple of Jupiter.” So we are expecting many more Temples of Jupiter 
		ahead. And guide will tell you that here Christians were thrown to the 
		lions, as our guide pointed down into the remains of a Forum cistern. To 
		top things off as we left the Arch of Titus behind, Mr. Air suddenly 
		grabbed his stomach with a groan/ ”What’s the matter, have you swallowed 
		a button?” asked Mrs MacKinney. ”Its worse than that. My belt has 
		broken, he intoned. Ted said “ Do you mean nour belt gave? If so that’s 
		impossible for a Scotchman who never gives anything.” A laugh and a sigh 
		as Mr. Air clutched desperately his breeches while and mumbling 
		something in his Scotch brogue.<br><br>With the day’s rich memories it 
		was with great difficulty that we broke away, passing the last of the 
		Parish pilgrim procession at the final church. Darkness was falling and 
		the time short and distance long. Mr Mac Kinney started down the line of 
		cariocas (horse-drawn open carriages)-always waiting at the Coliseum) as 
		they tried to find one that would take all eight of us for 8 liras. 
		Success led to our starting home with Ted sitting with the driver. What 
		a comical site as our old horse struggled with his ungainly load up 
		winding avenues. I felt we should get off and give old Dobbins a hand. 
		but similar experiences with oriental rickshaws restrained me. And then 
		the procession pulled into view, a hundred strong and still singing 
		lustily. All seemed fresh although they had been tramping all day. They 
		chanted into the night with Latin responses. At the final church, flames 
		from gas lamps on the balustrade above, waved merrily in the wind. We 
		would like to have stayed, but appetites called for relief, so bck to 
		the Pensione.<br><br>At 9PM Ted and I decked out in Loren MacKinney’s 
		blue coats, a few inches short but serving the purpose walked over to 
		the exclusive Hotel Excelsior on Via Veneto for beer o coffee with the 
		Flannerys, our acqaintances from the Catacombs who had invited us to 
		drive to Naples with them. Mr. O”Connel turned up also and we had a 
		merry time consuming two and a half bottles of beer each and listening 
		most of the time to Mr. O”Connel. What a great fellow-a bachelor from 
		Cork. He invited us to stay with him in Ireland. We will make the 
		attempt to get there.<br><br>Plans were made for the trip to Naples. 
		First day we would drive to Naples; second to Amalfi and along the 
		Riviera road to Sorrento, just for you, Mom, Then we go back to Naples, 
		Herculaneum, Pompeii and Vesuviua. On the fourth day, to the museum and 
		aquariam and then back to Rome. Then Ted and I go on to Florence,<br>
		<br>Both the Flannerys are young and enthusiastic, full of fun and 
		humor. I am finishing this letter in Naples after our first day here. We 
		are having a good time even if the weather is “not so hot”, By the way, 
		when we phoned Mr. Flannery in the evening, an Italian answered first, 
		then a Frenchman, and finally someone speaking English-the international 
		code, suggesting not many Americns are vistors from Rome. This is our 
		first night in the Pension. When we get to Venice, hope news from home 
		will be there. Dick<br><br><br>Rome May 4-n Rome to Naples Ted<br><br>
		<br><br>Another day gone and we really haven’t started to se Rome. It 
		isn’t because we haven’t tried. Miss Gallagher, our new and good friend 
		here said she went, went, went, for two solid months before she felt she 
		knew enough about Rome to leave. Reverand Hayes, head of the College of 
		North America, a theological institution, told us this afternoon, when 
		we met him to secure entrance to the Vatican Galleries, that he was here 
		for five years seeing Rome, and even then didn’t feel he had seen it 
		all. So you may understand what we are up against.<br><br>This morning 
		was spent mostly for business. We managed to see a few things near the 
		Tiber where Horatius held his bridge. The section is called the Forum 
		Bearium, and it is full of interest. San Giego in Velabre was erected in 
		honor of St, George, the soldier saint whose skull rests in a case in 
		front of the alter. The chapel is plain and pleasing while the pillars 
		that form the nave are of different sizes and decorations, probably 
		secured from a variety of earlier temples when this church was erected. 
		We gave to the small lady who fired Italian at an attempt to be a guide, 
		one lira as is the custom. Adjacent to the 12th century porticos is the 
		small Archus Argentarorum, or Arch of the Moneychangers. By the looks of 
		the dilapidated stone carvings they must have had stock exchange crashes 
		in those days too. An Arch to Janus, also in the same condition close by 
		and opposite is a remnant of the Cloaca Maxima, an ancient channel 
		constructed to drain the Forum. The word Cloaca is prominent in medicine 
		today. The old arches still stand and we could trace the course of the 
		channel as it reached the Tiber. A temple to Vesta rises close to the 
		river, and another temple in poor condition stands near it. We rode on 
		down along the bank of the Tiber to where the Circus Maximus was, and is 
		still in the form of an arena, Ruins at one end suggest that is where 
		the contestants entered. Then down to the Arch of Constantine which is 
		possibly the best preserved monument in Rome. It was built after 
		Constantine declared himself in favor of Christianity. It is covered 
		with very readable stories of historical significance. The Coliseum 
		looks mighty large in comparison to the Arch. Our pension is not far 
		away and soon we were eating lunch. The afternoon was spent taking care 
		of business about the camera, the Vatican, posting letters, getting 
		tickets. etc. then a big dinner and to bed.<br><br><br><br>May 8 in 
		Napoli<br><br><br><br>We are well situated in a pensione overlooking the 
		Bay of Naples with Vesuvius to our left and Capri straight ahead to the 
		south. Today we drove down from Rome with our new friends, the 
		Flannerys. Finally getting away af 11:30 after quite a delay, we drove 
		out the Appian Way to Alano, and then on south reaching here at 5:30. 
		The car is a blue sport phaeton Ford. By the way, the sirens are 
		sounding that Addis Ababa has fallen, so expect we will see some 
		celebration. Too bad we are not in Rome.<br><br>We are back again after 
		an hour outside on the streets, and the people, mostly kids, are 
		parading and milling everywhere. Black uniforms, black shirts, and black 
		suits are everywhere. The kids are having the time of their lives. 
		Sirens screamed for an hour, with accompanying bells and while we were 
		observing the marching blackshirts, an airplane flew over and dropped 
		packets of color paper reading “Viva Il Duce.” Flags have been hoisted 
		and hang from every window. We walked down to the beach promenade away 
		from the crowds and watched a huge full yellow moon rise at the foot of 
		Vesuvius which was slowly fading in the dusk with a faint outline of 
		smoke rising from the crater. Capri has already disappeared as the 
		lights of Naples appear. Also, not to be forgotten is the radio from 
		which we enviously get the roars of happy crowds in Rome, and the voices 
		from loudspeakers, probably from a spot we wondered about this morning. 
		It all stands for something we cannot grasp.<br><br>Back to our pleasant 
		trip–It is hard to write because of the roar outside with an explosion 
		now and then, and intermittent bells ringing. To go back, we rode the 
		bumpy Appian Way, along the stretch that is so painted and photographed. 
		The fields of flowers are quite special. Their reds and yellows make the 
		ride itself enjoyable, despite bumps. The landscape is solid green and 
		we drove for miles through the country, by farms that Mussolini (Mr. 
		Mulligan over here for fear of being arrested for conspiracy-has 
		constructed over the reclaimed marshlands, now free of malaria bearing 
		mosquitos. I belive DDT did it. Quite wonderful and close to the Perfect 
		Project. Each farm has its house, which has been given by the 
		government, usually to a war veteran. After a while a little rent is 
		collected, and they must watch the farmers closely. On the side of every 
		house is the year in Mr. Mulligan’s regime when the farm was laid out. 
		Both scenery and people intrigued us. Orange and lemon trees abound and 
		vineyards are plentiful. Picturesque ruins border the road and every now 
		and then, the remains of an aqueduct appear in the distance. Battlements 
		with square fighting towers loom up at turns and in the background are 
		mountains overhung ith clouds. In the grain fields, men and women were 
		working, and along the road women carry huge bundles of faggots, or 
		water jars on their heads. Is this where the word “headstrong” comes 
		from? The costumes vary. One lady wore a dark skirt, red apron, white 
		blouse, dark blue vest, and a lace bonnet. We noticed though that there 
		really is no real beauty about these people, unless is their carriage, 
		for they have wonderful postures. But they look like very hard working 
		folks who have never seen a beauty shop, and have cared less. As we came 
		further south, the surroundings were less neat, almost dirty. But here 
		was the same picturesqueness about the towns, nestled below or perched 
		on the foothills. The streets were dirty, and I suppose mirror the 
		people themselves. It is hard for us to accept, for we had always 
		visualized Italy and Naples as clean and beautiful. Donkeys pull carts 
		by themselves, or work with horses and sometimes a lone rider is in a 
		saddle or on a bare back. Once we saw a donkey working one of those 
		revolving heels at a well, and ducks and geese are usually around 
		somewhere. About 5 o’clock we came into town and along the bay front to 
		the Grand Hotel where the Flannerys are staying. Dick and i shouldered 
		our packs and set out to find a pension. After the usual, negotiations 
		we have a grand view, and who can ask for anything more? Ted<br><br><br>
		<br>May 4 Rome DICK<br><br><br><br>We’re a few days behind again, and as 
		we catch up it is a skeleton of our day’s activities, because so much of 
		what we are observing is in the books and we would be wasting precious 
		time in being detailed.<br><br>We started the day off with a highly 
		profitable visit to the American Consulate on Rome’s greatest street, 
		Via Veneto, lined with with pots of azaleas and shaded by giant plane 
		trees. The Consulate personnel were a joy as they were anxious to help. 
		Mr. Blake, just transferred from Geneva, knows our friends there. We 
		registered our passports and then were given passes to all of the 
		state-owned museums. Then down to Cunard to see about tickets home. It 
		will cost $10 a piece more to come home on the Berengaria but its 
		departure on August 26th makes the most sense. As we waited in the 
		consulate, the Rotarian Magazine advertising Atlantic City for its next 
		international meeting caught my eye.<br><br>A long ride along the twisty 
		dirt colored Tiber beneath more plane trees and ancient monuments took 
		us to the Department of Education, another striking marble edifice, 
		where we made application for our “tessara” to be ready tomorow. It ws 
		then only 11AM, giving us just enough time to visit some famous 
		chiurches.<br><br>Santa Maria in Travestore and Saint Cecelia are both 
		on the Tiber’s right side, the same as Vatican City. Both are in the old 
		quarters of th city, hemmed in by midieval houses and narrow streets. It 
		was not an easy job finding their entrances, for all are so plain and 
		uninteresting. In our travels we have learned never to judge a person or 
		a building by its exterior, for great beauty may many times lie behind 
		the plainest uninteresting facade.<br><br>Santa Maria in Travestore is 
		built where a spring is supposed to have suddenly welled forth at 
		Christ’s birth. The 22 columns of unequal size are the most arresting, 
		as they support straight entablature and ceiling. These columns are 
		ancient, and probably taken from some temple of earlier tomes. This was 
		the general practice of course causing the ruin of great architecture. 
		The floor of inlaid marble is now rough with age. It has been worn down, 
		irregular as stronger stones resisit wear and become almost stumbling 
		blocks. Several periods are represented in the mosaics depicting 
		biblical themes.<br><br>Saint Cecelia was the most interesting of any 
		church we have yet visited. She practiced Christianity devoutly without 
		her parents knowledge. And they betrothed her to a young and up and 
		coming man against her will, she praying to God to protect her 
		virginity. After the ceremony she told her husband her wish and he was 
		so inspired by her words that that he became a Christian secretly. The 
		church was built right over the the traditional house of Saint Cecelia 
		and recently excavated. A spacious garden leads up to the portico of the 
		church, and into the nave, beautiful in its simplicity. Small in size 
		and so plain in decoration– what a sanctuary of restfulness, after 
		gaping and gasping at the “massiveness” in the great churches of Rome.<br>
		<br>A little more about Saint Cecelia. It is a long and interesting 
		story. Here are the highlights. After her marriage, with her husband’s 
		agreement, she remained a virgin. The emperor took a liking to her, and 
		she tried to convert him. He had her murdered in the bathroom which is 
		preserved in the church and tastefully decorated with frescoes and 
		mosaics. Below in the crypt we find the seplucharal Chapel housing her 
		remains, brought from the catacombs of Saint Calliptus. A beautiful 
		sculpture shows her as she really was, so the story goes. It is of white 
		marble found years after the burial, intact and with the murderous cuts 
		across her neck<br><br>By the time St. Cecelia had been thoroughly 
		studied we were two ravenous Lyons, so hurried back the many miles to 
		the pension for a delicious lunch. Our appetites and my pants with it 
		many patches are standing jokes now. A patch a day keeps disaster away.
		<br><br>We finally had to break down and spend our precious cash on 
		pants. The stores had only pants for Italians, smaller in stature. A 
		tailor came to the pension and measured me and agreed to make for me a 
		pair, dark gray and of excellent material, for 150 lira, and we bartered 
		him down to 110 and believed we had a fair deal. Cheap cloth can be 
		found in the department stores here, but we followed Dad’ s dictum that 
		it pays to get the best. We won’t get the pants until Monday so we will 
		patch and I will be carefull to sit lightly.<br><br>The weather looked 
		theartening again. as small drops of rain fall, and we are forced to 
		sightsee on foot, for it is hard to find some place to drag bikes under 
		cover. The rain has surely cramped our style, for a wet day is not the 
		ideal time to see Forum Romanum, or the Capitine and Palatine Hills.<br>
		<br>Santa Maria Maggiore was just a few blocks away, so should be our 
		first afternoon’s visit. It is the largest of Rome’s eighty churches all 
		dedicated to the Virgin. It is said that in the 13th century the Virgin 
		appeared simultaneously to a devout patrician, Johannes, and Pope 
		Tiberius, and in their dreams, commanding them to build a church where 
		they found snow the next morning . This Basilica is the result, of 
		course altered many times. A Basilica is a church that has been used 
		also as a meeting house, a court of justice, or as an exchange.<br><br>
		The beauty of the interior grows as one looks closely at the time of 
		some Catholic gathering as we witnessed on Sunday, enchanting in the 
		candle light. Most striking was the smoothly curved ceiling, said to 
		have been gilded with gold brought from the Americas. We were reminded 
		of the same temple ceilings, gilded, in Japan and China. Thirty-six dark 
		ionic columns and four granite columns support the ceiling. Tombs and 
		chapels line the aisles. Enough of this description to be found in any 
		guide book.<br><br>We left again in the rain and hurried down the Via 
		Carlo Alberto to Piazza Vittorio Emanuele where spreading trees gave us 
		a little shelter and the cats were everywhere. They are in droves, 
		resting under bushes-white ones, brown, gray, black and serene in their 
		ancient paradise. They are fed every day by the same people. We thought 
		of Nara and the deer. Any difference, really? We take off for home, 
		dinner and bed. Dick<br><br><br>May 6 Napoli Dick Sorrento -*<br><br>
		<br><br>This morning on arising and shining at seven, we received our 
		first view of Vesuvius, hazy in the distance because of a heavy fog 
		covering everything. Smoke circled from it as if it is a chimney, 
		spreading out into a great blanket, because there is no wind at the 
		moment. Hope I can get it on film.<br><br>This is how it looked from the 
		pension window that looks out to the sea some blocks away. The black 
		smoke forms a great shroud that moves with the wind. Ted has told you 
		about our experiences leading up to today and I will continue.<br><br>
		”What a difference a day makes” was continually running through our 
		minds as we climbed and twisted along percipitous mountain sides, the 
		crashing surf below. The sun was completely hidden, spoiling many of the 
		effects the camera wishes for. Many times we passed over narrow gorges, 
		green with the spray from trickling water falls. Fishing boats lying on 
		the sand of sheltered cove beaches with white houses for background 
		clinging over the water’s edge would make some beautiful shots. Of 
		course we tried for pictures, and hope a few will come out all right. 
		This drive from Amalfi to Sorrento is supposed to be about the most 
		beautiful in Italy, so rugged is the coast, and picturesque the fishing 
		hamlets. Luckily, Mr. Flannery is a photo nut too, with his beautiful 
		Bell and Howell cine with all the lenses and using the new colored film. 
		So we stopped time and time again.<br><br>Italian flags flew every place 
		in celebration of the occupation of Addis Ababa, but can you imagine our 
		surprise to find, on reaching a grade summit, two great flags flying 
		over the road, American and Italian. It was all quickly explained. “Why 
		the American flag?” Mr Flannery queried in his best Italian, with the 
		aid of gesticulations. “Why? I’m from New York,” the man replied 
		positively, “And you know New York is New York.” So all doubts were 
		cleared away and on we went.<br><br>The most disappointing thing about 
		the day is that we had to see your Sorrento, Mom, in a drizzle. This 
		quaint little town is situated some four miles off the main road, and we 
		wound and twisted over cobblestones to reach the town square, Palazzo 
		Tasso, named after that hard-luck poet. We found your lace shop on the 
		corner. It is a heaven for feminine fancies. Once inside, Madame 
		Garguile took us right in hand, and with what joy she exhibited her 
		filmy wares.<br><br>“C’est tres belle,” “Plus belle,” and “La plus 
		belle” accompanied everything. She has her heart in her work, for sure. 
		How you would enjoy a few hours under her guidance, with rooms filled 
		with every sort of work from inlaid wood to to the finest 
		needlework-Ponte Sorrento. I have told the madame that someday we would 
		return with you to this lace shop of your dreams, and we can’t keep her 
		waiting long, you know. Dad would have been right at home, too, midst 
		the display of beautiful Sorrento silk ties. It was during our 
		inspection that Ted received a most flattering complement. “Why, you 
		look like an Italian” the madame’s assistant said. So Ted is getting his 
		“O Sole Mios” ready for an American debut, as the great American Italian 
		tenor, Theodora Lyon. By the way, we haven’t seen hide or hair of the 
		raviolas we have heard about, and these folks will not fix spaghetti the 
		way we do so well at home.<br><br>A few minutes drive took us to fine 
		vantage point above the town. Sorrento lies on the top of a 
		perpendicular cliff, dropping a hundred feet at the least to the shore. 
		The shore is not rugged, just straight up and down. The houses are small 
		and quaint, surrounded by stone walls that line the sides of the narrow 
		cobblestone streets. Horses and donkeys with ornate harnesses crested 
		with silver, pull rumbling two wheeled wagons as they carry heavy loads. 
		Bells and color are all an important part of the rig’s makeup. The 
		drivers seem always to be dozing, allowing Dobbin to pick his way. Many 
		carts, pulled by tiny mules roll slowly by. Everyone here takes it easy, 
		an old Italian custom of great merit, for the auto has not yet 
		established itself as an advantage to man. Sorrento is surely a haven of 
		rest, off the beaten track and away from the hurry and scurry of the 
		real world. However, it has its share of dirt, just as have all of the 
		towns we have seen in southern Italy so far. Perhaps it is just as well, 
		though, for how could any people be as lazy and dreamy without the 
		inevitable dirt.<br><br>More twists and turns took us back along the 
		shore beneath Vesuvius, smoking as ever, below Pompeii. and over the 
		fine Auitostrada back to Naples where we again were emeshed in the maze 
		of unkept streets. The city of odors we now call it. If anyone wishes to 
		see and feel really basic life it is here.<br><br>With packs on our 
		backs, we went again up the hill to find a new and cheaper pension. And 
		that we did, for 36 lira, instead of the 50 the night before. And we got 
		a lot more for our money, because the pension was Swiss-owned and run, 
		and everything spic and span and tasty. We still hoped to return to 
		Sorrento under the sun but that was not to be.<br><br><br>#15 TED ROME 
		MAY 6<br><br><br><br>THIS MORNING WE were as close to the center of 
		Christianity in our world as it possible to be. That is, in the dome of 
		the Cathedral of St. Peters. The Cathedral is quite indescribable and in 
		order to a get any appreciation of what it really is, one must see it, 
		as Dick said for we can’t understand how man could combine such 
		immensity with such beauty. One receives a real education in just the 
		few hours among its treasures. And what stands out in our minds? First 
		is its immense size. It took us two and one half minutes to leisurely 
		walk the length of the nave. The side aisles alone are the size of 
		basketball courts, and the dome rises over 400 feet, more than 100 
		yards, and is nearly as large in diameter as the Pantheon. The seated 
		figure of St. Peter is quite wonderful. His right foot has been partly 
		worn down by kisses of the devout. Another great work is Michelangelo’s 
		Pieta, the statue of Mary holding Christ. How can one forget it? The 
		inlaid marble floor becomes something hard to describe as one sees it 
		from above in the dome. Gardens around the cathedral seem surreal.<br>
		<br>We understand that all of the paintings which once adorned the walls 
		are now in the Vatican Museum, and other churches around Rome. In their 
		places are mosaics, so real that even as copies, they are just as 
		effective. One of the mosaics portrays St. Michael, and later we saw the 
		original as a painting in a church in the heart of Rome. The high alter 
		has a canopy of bronze, and the confessional below is of inlaid marbles 
		and golden lamps, just breath taking. We are aching to go back again 
		among these treasures but that would take a year.<br><br>After a full 
		morning at the Cathedral we put away a bowl of spaghetti, several dishes 
		of bread, a big entree, and two oranges. Yes, we are being truly fed 
		here. After lunch, Mr. MacKinney, Loren Kinney, Dick, and I visited the 
		Capitoline Museum which contains the statue known to all of us as the 
		“Flying Gaul”. Every muscle and the position of every limb is a study 
		itself. Busts of Socrates, Plato, Homer and other Greeks of equal 
		stature fill the rooms, and their faces take on new meaning for us. A 
		portion of Achilles shield caught our eyes. Is it real? Roman gods lined 
		every hall, and our imaginations could soar. Part of the museum is a 
		church, Santa Maria in Araeocoli, occupying the site of the Capitoline 
		Temple of Juno. One of our reasons for this adventure was to see the 
		“Bambino,” a life sized depiction of Jesus adorned with amethyists, 
		diamonds, and gold. It was carved from live trees in the fifteenth 
		century. The statue is venerated by Catholics, and it is supposed to do 
		wonder for those it blesses.<br><br>Our next stop was at American 
		Express, then at another small church adjoining a Capuchin monastery. 
		Our friends know it as “the Church of the Bones,” for below it is the 
		monastary cemetery, and the hundreds of bones are arranged in 
		geometrical designs around the walls and ceilings of five small damp 
		rooms. Several corpses dressed in decaying shrouds are propped up in the 
		midst of the bones. It was depressing and not condusive to meditation.<br>
		<br>Our afternoon was well finished off with a dish of ice cream at the 
		Plazza Barbera adjoining Diocletion’s Baths, which we have not yet seen. 
		We rested for an hour, absorbed observing the humanity around and just 
		talked. Then home to a whale of a meal.<br><br>PS It seems that the 
		Laurel and Hardy film was a recent arrival in Rome, and ever since one 
		hears their theme song in the streets. A boy just went by below 
		whistling the tune. Small world? Not necessarily. Ted<br><br><br><br>
		<br><br><br>May 6..Amali Ted<br><br><br><br>We took the famous Amalfi 
		Drive today but the weather was cloudy and discouraging during the whole 
		trip, so impressions are not as we had hoped them to be. It was 
		enjoyable, though. We started out about 10 o’clock. It was hard to find 
		our way out of the city as they have a bad habit of having almost no 
		signs. And to top it all off, boys were marching, wagons rattling, as 
		both thoroughly clog up traffic. We finally managed to get on the main 
		route and we emerged from the city on a fine new road, an the 
		Autostrada. Vesuvius with its tapering sides and funnel of white smoke 
		swirling from the cone, was at the left. The Bay Of Naples lay to the 
		right, and vineyards, orchards, trees, ruins and wild flowers surrounded 
		us on all sides. It was truly as picturesque as we have seen. To Pompeii 
		and Herculaneum we drove we drove towards Vistri, when the road meets 
		the sea after circling inland. Some of the flowers we saw were 
		marigolds, peonies, snapdragons, daises, and those red poppies, really 
		exquisitely red. Ivy covers trees to fill in the landscape. We passed 
		several flocks of sheep and noted that on the forehead or back of each 
		animal is a distinctive mark presumably for identification. Donkeys, as 
		usual are abundant, one or two with feathers in their caps. Wagons with 
		huge wheels clutter up the road and nothing much can be done about it. 
		The driver just lies on his seat and goes to sleep. He looks like he is 
		waiting for the zero hour to go over the top as we pull up behind. Bells 
		on horses and mules are the tops in style. The animals are really 
		colorful with a few decorations and tinkling bells. Still, there is a 
		dingy aspect about the whole scene. Mr. Mulligan (Il Duce) has plenty of 
		work yet to do. However, the people seem contented and always anxious to 
		please.<br><br>It was not long before we left Vesuvius behind and were 
		nearing Vietri and the water gain. Always the sides of the road are 
		green. But when water was in view and Amalfi ahead, the road began to 
		skirt the highlandswhich border the sea. We caught glimpses of fishing 
		towns, nets out to dry on the beaches, and weather beaten boats resting 
		on their sides, all with fading paint. The road is dangerously narrow as 
		we rose and descended, always with a wondrous view. Lemons seem to the 
		major crop, but in order to keep the trees from falling down the steep 
		hillsides, they are propped up with arbor-like structures, giving an 
		unnatural effect. Amalfi appeared about one o’clock and we stopped at 
		the Santa Caterina Hotel for lunch. It was a treat to sit out on the 
		terrace overlooking the sea and Almalfi below nestled in its cove. Lunch 
		was two large plates of spaghetti with tomato sauce and powdered cheese, 
		the standard combination. Dick finally likes cheese. It because he hates 
		to see it go to waste, or is it really appetizing? An orange finished 
		the lunch and we then got on our way to Sorrento.<br><br>Just a few 
		disconnected thoughts while Dick makes out the direful expense account. 
		Something we have noticed that should Interest Wins are many racing 
		crews working our along all of the bay fronts, both here and in Genoa. 
		They, like the rest of the world, are awakening to sports, and are 
		really going after them, with Il Duce’s full blessing and help. What a 
		more beautiful place could one find to row?<br><br>Last night we stopped 
		at a Pensione, Plato Storey, which was very nice at 25 lira full with 
		room, dinner and breakfast. But the food, t although of excellent 
		quality, merely sufficed to tempt our appetites, so we foraged after 
		dinner for a new lodging. With luck we found one just up the street. 
		That same night when we were walking we passed along streets with flags 
		flying at all angles, but the best effects were made by rugs hung over 
		windowsills in the national colors of red, white, and green. Opening out 
		into the sidewalks were many one-room houses. People were eating or 
		talking inside, and anyone could look in to see what was going on. Every 
		room had its alter and religious pictures. It reminded us faintly of the 
		Orient, where small shrines are seen in the same way/.<br><br>While we 
		have ridden through country towns around Naples, we have been impressed 
		by the similarity and the Philippine Islands., The people live in much 
		the same unclean manner. On the other hand the central City of Naples, 
		itself, as far as we can see,. is doing a fair job at making the 
		necessary positive changes along cleanliness lines. Ted<br><br><br>Ted 
		Mussolini story i<br><br><br><br>We have just had a marvelous 
		experience, a description or which I will try to put into words. On our 
		return from Naples on May 9 we found the city at a high pitch of 
		excitement. That evening everyone was anticipating momentous and crucial 
		proclamations by Mussolini in relation to Italy’s newly assumed status. 
		We hopped into a cab which carried us to within a half mile of Piazza 
		Venezia, the center ot Rome and flanked by government headquarters and 
		the Vittoria Emanuel Monument. We were forced to alight from the cab and 
		move through the hurrying crowd as we entered from the southeast past 
		Trajan’s Forum and the Forum Romanum. We could not help thinking of the 
		phrase, “Time marches on”. Rivers of Romans flowed along every radiating 
		thoroughfare entering the plaza, and these are wide streets. We were 
		quickly engulfed in the sea of humanity, moving like a giant ooze into 
		Piazza Venezia. The square was rapidly filling. It was then about 9 PM. 
		Search lights were playing on the Monument. Brightly burning oil lamps 
		were in the hands of troops solidly filling its stairs, forming 
		necklaces against the sky also twinkling, but with stars. From behind 
		the dimly visible Coliseum to the east a three-quarter moon was arising, 
		unnoticed by most as attention focused on the spectacular illumination 
		of the marble and gold of the Monument.<br><br>Soldiers representing 
		special units of the Army stood at rigid attention on the stairs-a field 
		of gray and shining metal. Civilians sought a view on statues and to 
		escape the painfully common elbow jabs and shin kicks. Black shirted and 
		uniformed men surged about in attempts to come close to their leader. 
		People crowded rooftops from which floodlights played on the mass below. 
		Balconies were dotted with fashionable evening clothes. Flags and 
		banners rustled from windows, and cleverly placed beams of light at low 
		levels heightened the aura of the event.<br><br>Somehow, Dick and I had 
		managed to worm our way to a spot almost directly under the balcony 
		where Mussolini was to appear. I still don’t know how we did it, but 
		perhaps our size and athletic ability helped as we gently yet firmly 
		worked our way. By this time, not 10 minutes before the scheduled time 
		for Il Duce’s appearance, the square is absolutely filled as are the 
		entering octopus-like avenues. Bands played and trumpets sounded. While 
		we waited we were joined by a fellow American who was much amused by the 
		people around us guessing at our nationality. At the moment we desired 
		to be thought as anything but English, because of the sanctions, and 
		were glad to learn that we were believed to be Swiss. Apparently our 
		heights were accepted as typical of the Swiss Vatican guards, perhaps 
		off duty. American flags on our lapels would have been a help, but 
		height won as we could look out over the whole crowd. Dick took one 
		photo holding his camera high. Wonder how it will turn out?<br><br>The 
		crowd was electrified with anticipation. A group of students wearing 
		long slender colorful hats were near us. Other groups were wildly 
		demonstrating, yelling and waving satirical signs above the crowd. The 
		center of attention in front of us was the Austrian Embassy building, 
		now the abode of the Dictator. As the zero minute approached, all eyes 
		focused on the small central balcony from which hung a red banner 
		bearing the gold Fascisti emblem. National colors flanked the balcony, 
		casting shadows on the doors behind. The crowd was becoming impatient. 
		Cheering and clapping kept rising in pitch and volume. From strong 
		throats came<br><br>“Duce,Duce,Duce”(Duechay) in rapid succession. 
		Tenseness in expectation ran like an electric current from shoulder to 
		shoulder, climaxing in a roar as the curtained doors opened and two 
		figures stepped out on the balcony, one in black and one in gray. The 
		composure of the man in gray immediately marked him as the Dictator. 
		Have to admit it was a bit of a thrill, this demonstration of loyalty to 
		and admiration for this man.<br><br>(by Dick)<br><br>As the furor 
		continued for many minutes, the “man of the hour” smilingly leaned 
		forward, his hands on the balustrade, and straightened to speak. And the 
		crowd became silent. His salutary greeting received a tremendous roar 
		and Fascisti salutes. Il Duce spoke again, slowly and forcefully 
		emphasizing his points with piston like motions of his left hand. The 
		multitude, straining to hear, resounded to each statement with an 
		explosive ovation. During the cheers, our American friend translated for 
		us as follows:<br><br>“The King shall henceforth assume the title of 
		Emperor. You citizens have made this possible by your faith and 
		sacrifice We will defend our rights against any foe. After fifteen 
		centuries, the Roman Empire is reestablished. Before God and the World, 
		have you faith in the new empire? Do you swear to stand together in life 
		or death. Salute the Emperor”.<br><br>It was now clear who was the 
		second man on the balcony, both men small in stature. It was the King. 
		Thundering “Si’s” from a million throats followed each query. There is 
		no doubt as to the sincerity of all in their beliefs in their leader. 
		His personal magnetism and force is obvious. His presentation finished, 
		within seconds he had gone through the draped doors.<br><br>“Duce, Duce, 
		Duce” rang forth until the doors parted again and as with a curtain call 
		the Black Shirt leader and saluted. But the crowd was not satisfied. 
		Twice more he appeared and as we left the scene, the chants were 
		continuing. While we passed through the streets and refreshed our selves 
		at a street side cafe, newspaper extras still wet from the press hit the 
		streets and demonstrating students kept up with their chants.<br><br>And 
		then a strange thing happened. We noticed a crowd of young people moving 
		towards something, and it turned out to be the Quirinal. the King’s 
		palace not far away So we followed along to see Mussolini and the King 
		again waving together on the balcony. This reminded us of a college 
		serenade on sorority row, for the spirit was much the same. What a day!<br>
		<br><br>May 7 Naples <br><br>The sun now setting over the hills to the 
		west brings to an end another full and profitable day, not to mention 
		sheer enjoyment as we take everything in. We have at last seen and 
		studied the historical sites, Herculaneum and Pompeii, buried with 
		volcanic ash in 79 BC as Vesuvius erupted in a manner known to every 
		American school child. The day passed quickly as we walked the stone 
		streets, inspected Ionic columns and peered into grass covered atriums 
		with marble fountains and frescoed walls, the art now barely visible 
		after 2000 years of burial. It has been a marvelous revelation to gaze 
		into an ancient civilization rich in art, and with many comforts we have 
		today. The nineteenth hole is the closest institution we have to the 
		luxurious baths of Pompeii where “the “400’ enjoyed every last word in 
		luxury as they whiled their time away.<br><br>Ted has told you how we 
		acquired our guide and, further, our experience in Pompeii. However, 
		buried cities were not the only things we saw, for our auto trip out and 
		back was an eye-opener in itself. There are two ways to get to Pompeii, 
		the Auto Strada where they soak you and the regular road, free of 
		course. Well we elected to go that way, but we didn’t know what was 
		ahead. The thirty minutes we spent bouncing over rough paving stones, 
		dodging thru horse and wagon traffic, chewing dust here and there, all 
		with a few reminders in the form of Italian comments, was our education. 
		What a ride! The streets were packed with the classic Italian wagons, 
		two wheeled with axles in the center, and anywhere from a solitary 
		donkey to five horses pulling. What charioteers these drivers would make 
		as they stood, reins in hand, cracking their whips with mastery. We 
		dodged back and forth between them, our faith being in drivers’ control. 
		If anyone has any illusions about the extinction of the horse as a dray 
		animal, he’d better come to Naples where the horse age is in full swing 
		and autos just get in the way. Children run and play in the street, 
		dodging horse teams with casualness, but the sound of our horn sends 
		them scurrying to the dirty sidewalk. The poor street cleaners are 
		continually stooped with little do-dads to pick up here and there, 
		remembrances from straining steeds-things we never think about in 
		America. Wee became used to seeing flocks of sheep splotched with red 
		paint- perhaps a mark of owners, being herded down the street by 
		gentlemen carrying umbrellas for sticks. What strange and unreal sights 
		were the tiny donkeys pulling a fat women seated in cart that required a 
		full sized horse. What a drama of activity going on day in and day out, 
		interrupted only by some American motorist trying to save a buck as he 
		makes his way through<br><br>Burt the most important thing I forgot to 
		mention-how people move their goods in Italy. Dad take note. It seems 
		that May is the moving month here when leases end and people change 
		apartments. The goods are piled on carts and tied down, a blanket here 
		and there, with a horse or horses pulling. Motorized transportation is 
		still a fairy tale. Crackling whips take the place of roaring exhausts. 
		Everyone must be moving on this day as wagons pass by, loaded to the 
		gunwales, goods sticking out all over. Ten years of moving this way 
		would make mince meat of anyone’s belongings. You see that we are making 
		a serious investigation of moving and storage, hoping to be helpful in 
		revolutionizing your industry in America. Mr Flannery is not so sure of 
		our intentions for he finds always kicking-kicking about the bills.<br>
		<br>Several factories were pointed out to us by our guide, John. When 
		asked about ravioli factories, he said that this dish is found mostly in 
		Florence, and that is the reason we have seen so little of it up to now.<br>
		<br>The Neapolitan beach palaces have fallen into decay. Once our road 
		passed through massive ports of the summer palace of the fallen king of 
		Naples. For the most part, cracking whips, tinkling bells and straining 
		horses so held our interist that a palace would pass by unnoticed<br>
		<br><br><br>POMPEII AT 12 O’CLOCK FROM TED<br><br><br><br>The weather 
		was again threatening today, allowing the sun infrequent peeks as we 
		wandered through Pompeii. At times Vesuvius stood out surprisingly clear 
		to the north, but it was shrouded in clouds most of the day. We hope 
		tomorrow will be clear when we climb Vesuvius<br><br>Retracing the 
		several miles on the bumpy road we arrived at Herculaneum. Seeing this 
		newly excavated city was a great treat, for we could watch the diggers 
		unearthing the ancient treasures. The town is set in a great rectangular 
		hole, and below the present land surface. They say the city was 
		originally covered by lava, not ash, making excavation far more 
		difficult. However the soil seemed more like a mud-flow filled with 
		pebbles and dirt. We will have to get the straight dope. The workers 
		were working with hoses, cutting away the dirt and dumping it into 
		baskets on small rail cars. Some of the newest “finds” are supported by 
		scaffolding while the digging goes on inside and out. Several of the 
		gentlemen, we suppose the supervisors, were very good at doing nothing. 
		Evidently, at some time during the day, they had amassed enough strength 
		to convert a few pieces of plaster to a place on the walls.<br><br>
		Herculaneum is quite wonderful because it is being reconstructed with 
		the original stones and paintings, giving us a real look at a 
		civilization that flourished 2000 years ago. It was a seaside town and a 
		new port of southern Italy, small and for pleasure seekers. It was the 
		seaside business center. Just how far the city extends still beneath the 
		earth’s surface is unknown. Unsightly apartment houses, cheap and dirty, 
		surround the excavations. Pompeii was rally covered with ashes, stones 
		and hot water, and completely submerged. One should visit Pompeii first 
		to understand how everything looked in the hay-day of Roman power.<br>
		<br>Herculaneum was built in much the same style as Pompeii, rough stone 
		roads running between closely packed houses and shops. Wood rafters were 
		extensively used, for one can see the charred remnants, now under glass. 
		”Carbonized” is the word of the guide. Mosaics depicting flowers have 
		been marvelously restored. Tile flooring is just a mosaic in grand 
		style. The figure of a lion was used extensively. Some gorgeous tables 
		are supported by lion heads still in perfect condition. A few statues 
		remain. but most of the treasures are now in the Naples Museum. Because 
		everything was really crushed, the walls have been rebuilt with murals 
		patched and replaced, in many cases still giving us a fine idea of how 
		things must have been. And of course you always find statues marred by 
		signatures, all of Italian tourists. Gardens have been replanted in the 
		atriums, and those folks understood design. Herculaneum has no forum 
		with temples, common to Pompeii. The town seems to have been just a 
		resort for[pleasure. In shops we find charred walnuts, corn, and figs, 
		all preserved under glass. Each day, if work continues with the 
		foresight shown this far, Herculaneum will be completely restored and 
		unique in restoration challenges. If the treasures are returned from the 
		Museum-bronzes, marble, mosaics, and are placed just as they were, 
		Herculaneum will be one of the great show places of the world, not only 
		for its human interest but as an education.<br><br>Business had slowed 
		down quite a bit as we drove back to Naples at 5 o’clock. Back on the 
		promenade once more we paid the agreed twenty lira to Giovanni, he a 
		still asking for a tip until we reminded him that we had made an 
		agreement for the final amount to be received. Cheap skates? Not sire.<br>
		<br><br>10....MAY 8 VESUVIUS<br><br><br><br>What a day this has been! 
		Our ascent of Vesuvius and our wanderings in the smoking crater have 
		made the volcano, for the moment, seem like a very old friend. We hate 
		to leave on the morrow. Our pleasant memories of Naples will always be 
		associated with this mountain puffing graceful streams of cream-colored 
		smoke to heaven, while commanding admiration and respect from all who 
		see her.<br><br>A bright sun awakened us at 6 PM. And after lying 
		another half hour, we climbed out and went to mail our letters to you. A 
		dense haze or fog hid Vesuvius and the islands from view, but this 
		gradually dissolved during the morning, save for a portion hanging about 
		the volcanic cone. leaving only a light blue haze over the sea, Capri, 
		and the southern coast to Sorrento. A large orange purchased yesterday 
		gave us he necessary calories and vitamins, before tearing into tea and 
		bread.<br><br>At nine we walked to the Flannery’s hotel, finally getting 
		started from there about 10:30 to visit the Naples Museum. As we walked 
		down to get the car, guess whom we happened to meet? It was Clan, our 
		first guide of the day before. He then proceeded to accompany us to 
		Vesuvius for a mere 15 lira just to tell us about the countryside as we 
		passed through it for the third time. We eventually managed to convince 
		him that we were doing very well on our own, and deposited him back on 
		his feet, still smiling with hope.<br><br>This driving through Europe is 
		an expensive business. These Latinos stick you for everything, and it is 
		hard to say “No” for they seem to be so poor. They will watch the car, 
		open the door, take your hand and guides see you a mile away. And then 
		there are the “gimmes” gentry of exclusive hotels. Bikes are the way to 
		go. Every place we go little kids ask us for cigarettes, some only 7 or 
		8 years old, and it seems to be the custom for a;ll kids to hook rides 
		on the backs of street cars, wagons, and even autos. In the country and 
		poor parts of the city there are always plenty of children all barefoot 
		and grimy from head to foot. Mr. Mulligan has done a fine job so far in 
		cleaning up the slums of Rome but he has a lot more ahead of him here in 
		these southern parts.<br><br>The Museum is immense and contains 
		inconceivable wealth in art treasures unearthed near here. They even had 
		blue glass in those days and gorgeous intricate cameos. The signet rings 
		had me bewitched, so beautiful are they. And they were right up to date 
		in gaming, for rows and rows of dice are little different from ours. 
		Etruscan vases of huge proportions and with graceful lines fill several 
		rooms. Gladiator helmets weighing 2 kilograms at least, and adorned with 
		fin finely wrought bronze moldings are in perfect states of 
		preservation, even though the gladiators are not. Silver goblets and 
		finely spun gold have been found as part of jewelry hard to replicate 
		today.<br><br>While the James Alloysius Flannerys III went to lunch at 
		the Grand Hotel, we had a grand luncheon of spaghetti in a street 
		restaurant on the edge of the adjacent small boat harbor. Ancient Castle 
		del Oro towered above us as we lapped up the spaghetti well garnished 
		with cheese and tomato sauce, all to the accompaniment of the place’s 
		orchestra and tenors. It was just the place you would expect to find 
		here, as they charged us extra for the tomato sauce and cheese. But we 
		did well for just 6 lira. That is the only argument we have with these 
		folks, as they tack on all the extra charges they can and then expect 
		tips as well. And then they se our bikes, not car, and they must smile.<br>
		<br>At 2 PM we finally got under way for the afternoon trip to Vesuvius, 
		taking the autostrada once more to Tore Anuziata, the road that then 
		took us up the mountain to the toll station. There we shelled out 23 
		lira apiece for the privilege of driving up a private road to within a 
		20 minute walk to the crater. This seemed like an atrocious amount a the 
		time, but we received our full money’s worth and an experience never to 
		be forgotten,<br><br>Of course, a guide was thrown in with it all, to 
		keep us on the path and out of the lava pits, as well as to point out 
		the interesting sights along the way. He did this in split-second 
		staccato English, pointing out the 1906 lava flow, and making us wonder 
		if there is any connection with the “06 earthquake in San Francisco. At 
		every turn, and there were many, the same explanation would pour forth. 
		He was probably about 60, his handle bar mustache twitching with phrase, 
		and he was as spry as a kid. His name Giuseppi of course is Joe to us, 
		and as Dad would say, “If all of the guides in the world were laid face 
		own, it would be a good thing”.<br><br>The soft dirt road wound back and 
		forth up 3000 feet or so, coming to an abrupt end where it had been 
		destroyed by the previous eruption. Vesuvius is<br><br>now pouring out 
		lava for the first time since 1929, the red hot stream passing beneath 
		the crater’s hardened crust to a lower level, then rolling over the edge 
		and doe down the mountainside, giving off a gray smoke as it comes in 
		contact with the cold lava from this and earlier eruptions.<br><br>The 
		first sight of this phenomenon was of course exciting, but more was yet 
		to come. After a good twenty minutes climb, we reached the crater’s edge 
		and could look inside it. Far off and beyond the center graceful plumes 
		of creamy white smoke poured from the main cone, rising symmetrically a 
		hundred feet or so. The cone stood engulfed completely in a sea of black 
		and twisted cooling lava filling the entire crater. I say “cooling” for 
		when we walked on it our shoes became hot, while gray steam poured from 
		cracks, all with the characteristic choking sulfurous odor. Great 
		chunks, broken and jagged, stood in place forced up by the pressure from 
		below, while the entire surface was cracked and buckled. On rounded 
		surfaces, the stone was corded, powerfulsulfurous gasses emitting.<br>
		<br>We really were thankful for our guide by this time. Joe led us down 
		on the black porous mass and he bounded along with alacrity, forcing us 
		to keep moving swiftly. Time and time again the upper foot of crust 
		would give way, and we would crunch through, swallowing hard to keep our 
		hearts from jumping out of our mouths. After several hundred yards of 
		scrambling we were brought up sharply by Joe who pointed out a glowing 
		red hole several yards away. The crust had broken in a few places and we 
		could see the molten viscous red liquid moving slowly toward the 
		crater’s edge. Red-hot lava right beneath us and only a few feet of firm 
		material separating the two of us. Torrid steam and gasses poured out 
		through the holes, so hot that a piece of cotton tossed in caught fire. 
		Mr. Flannery got some beautiful pictures, we hope, for if they come out 
		we really will have something to talk about.<br><br>Smoke from the cone, 
		as it blanked the crater, cut out most of the sunlight, for at the 
		moment there was no wind.<br><br>”We wish to go over to the other side 
		for a view of Naples and to get close to the cone”, we told Joe. ”Much 
		dange, much dange”, said he, shaking his head. But after consulting with 
		the Carabiniere on duty where he stands each day, Joe agreed to follow 
		our wishes. We once more climbed after him, cracking through the soft 
		upper crust, while hoping for something hard beneath, until we were 
		within 50 yards of the smoking cone. Mr. Flannery had a rougher time of 
		it with his camera and need to take shots every few feet.<br><br>What a 
		thrill it was as we stood as lightly as possible midst steam and gas, 
		listening to the rumble from the cone beneath us as beautiful sunlit 
		smoke clouds poured out and gasses from a vent in the cones’ side formed 
		a ring of red, yellow, and green at its edges. It was that uneasiness 
		about the molten streams below us that kept the chills running up and 
		down our spines. As gasses shot out, we were reminded of a train 
		whistle, substituting a rumble for a shriek.<br><br>We retrieved pieces 
		of brilliant yellow and red lava with a sulfurous powder on it. We were 
		surely as close to Hades as one can get on this earth physically, just 
		hoping that Vulcan would keep everything under control while we enjoyed 
		his wizardry. How strange it was to find one's breath condensing in the 
		cold air while surrounded with steam.<br><br>Joe seemed impatient to get 
		away, repeating over and over again as he pointed to the cone,”Much 
		dange,much dange!” And we agreed. So we finally yielded to his 
		entreaties and he made for the crater’s edge at full speed, leaving us 
		behind to pick our ways over the still warm surfaces. We were loathe to 
		leave this spectacle, but the sun was lowering in the sky, and if we 
		desired some photos we had better be quick about it. A dense haze, 
		unfortunately, hung over Naples, but to the south, Sorrento and the 
		coast beyond stood out fairly clear. Below us were the earth colored 
		ruins of Pompeii and further on, Castelemore, built over the ruins of 
		lava- destroyed Stabiae.<br><br>Whether our filters could cut through 
		the blue haze is doubtful. <br><br>Joe then led us back along the edge 
		of the crater where the redhot lava rolled and tumbled over. It’s as red 
		as the heated metal in the smithy’s forge. Every now and then a piece 
		would break off and crash down the precipice, a warning to those below 
		to be vigilant. Joe was impatient to get down so we ran down short cuts, 
		while taking our time on winding main paths, enjoying the panorama and 
		rethinking our experience. A few more bounces and we arrived at the toll 
		station, thanked Joe with a tip, and headed for Napoli. At one point in 
		the narrow road we worked our way slowly through a crowd attending a 
		funeral, someone of wealth if we can judge from the floral displays and 
		beauty of the jet black carriages. Stately plumes of course on the 
		horses, attest to the pomp of these occasions, so much a part of life 
		here.<br><br>In Naples once more, we wrote a while, stored away some 
		energy at dinner, and hit the hay, so thankful for another day to 
		remember.<br><br><br><br>SOME NOTES<br><br>Pompeii was destroyed by 
		ashes from “Soome” crater, right next to Vesuvius in 79 AD. Vesuvius 
		itself was not the cause! Southern Italians are crazy to have their 
		pictures taken. Everyone screams “shot” as I take out the camera, and 
		then they want cigarettes which cost 20 cents a pack here.<br><br><br>
		<br>MAy 10 FRIDAY<br><br><br><br>Not much doing today-some catching up 
		on our writing and recovering from the exciting night in wide=open Rome. 
		It is great to be back at Pensione Giuliana, and storing more wonderful 
		food. At 2 PM we rode out to San Pietro in Vincoli(St. Peter in Chains) 
		where the supposed actual chains are kept. The magnificent “ Moses” of 
		Michelangelo absorbed all of our interest. It is so familiar to most 
		Americans<br><br>Things looked threatening but we pedaled out beyond the 
		walls to S. Paolo fuori di Mura”( St. Paul Outside the Walls) and there 
		admired the cloisters, a gorgeous nave with 80 granite and 6 alabaster 
		columns, making is an impressive church because of its immense size.<br>
		<br>Then our luck gave out and the storm hit. We rode furiously back, 
		soaked to the skin . We are still drying out. We’ ‘ll have to wear 
		shorts to dinner. We can stand it and hope our friends will put up with 
		us.<br><br>So, we did go to dinner, Ted in shorts and both of us sweater 
		less. We surely have hit the bad weather right from the start, and it is 
		so hard for us to imagine storms in sunny Italy in May. They say this 
		has been their worst winter, and now summer in years. If there is a Law 
		of Compensation, we are entitled to great days ahead.<br><br>We also 
		pulled a boner when we sent you that birthday telegram at 12 AM here. 
		Hope receiving it was not traumatic for its possibility of suggesting 
		trouble.<br><br>Last night over a glass of beer we said Goodbye to the 
		Flannerys, and with the promise to stop over in Pittsburgh on our way 
		home. They were wonderful to us and just “regular fellers’, so we hate 
		to see them go, like so many wonderful friends made on this trip.<br>
		<br>Mother, I hope you received the Mothers’ Day greetings. Perhaps 
		someday we can all spend that day in Sorrento. It won’t be long now 
		before we will be home, soon away to school again.<br><br>We appreciate 
		more and more each day the wonderful land in which we live. America is a 
		veritable paradise, with milkshakes and honeysuckle. We are both lucky 
		and proud of our heritage.<br><br>Another item. Europe is no longer the 
		inexpensive place to live, for to live well with standards like our own 
		costs much more. We find that with our special lira Letter of Credit-17 
		lira to the dollar instead of 13, we can live for $3 a day. Of coos 
		things like pants and presents have their added prices.<br><br>Tomorrow 
		we look up Col. Cottica, the President of Rotary, and Archbishop Hanna 
		from San Francisco who at the moment resides here. I don’t know, Dad, if 
		you know him. Until now we have not contacted many people and thus 
		bother them because things have gone well as we run on our own,. It 
		looks as if we will stay on the train all of the way through Italy. We 
		will bike over the Simplon, through Switzerland and then on to Germany. 
		We still hope to go to Ireland, but that is a long shot. We aim for 
		Munich on June 15, and are aching for letters from you at least by then.<br>
		<br>We are now studying German, not bothering with Italian where we are 
		getting by with a few words very well. German is a different challenge 
		and more within our range for it is a lot like our own language in its 
		sounding. Hope everything is fine with you, and our love to Elizabeth. 
		and Ching.<br><br>American free ways in spending money here makes it 
		tough for the rest of us less affluent. Americans are expected to be 
		soaked for they know that will work. We are a little tired of bartering, 
		and hope that once further north, prices and agreements will be firm, 
		like our own. .Dick<br><br><br>7 Naples Ted<br><br><br><br>What a day! 
		Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Naples with the Flannerys, which makes it all 
		the better. Their car is a beauty and they have done so much for us. 
		They insist on paying certain charges and won’t take anything we try to 
		force on them. Besides this, they are real people, so we do have a kick 
		together. Pompeii is just as we expected it to be. To attempt any 
		adequate description is foolish, so I will just hit the high points.<br>
		<br>The first paragraph, I think, should be about our guide. While we 
		were waiting at the American Express, a good-looking boy stepped over 
		and asked if he could be our guide. He gave a reasonable price and we 
		talked. Soon we learned that he had known a Stanford boy, John 
		MacMillan, brother of Don, now a freshman at Stanford. The second person 
		he said he knew from America was Mister Harris, whom the Flannerys know 
		well. This was a surprise and coincidence. So we hired him and soon were 
		making tracks for Pompeii. We hadn’t gone far when he spoke up saying, 
		“Would you rarer have my brother. He speaks better English and knows the 
		ruined cities better”. This sounded OK so we picked up his brother 
		instead. But as it turned out he had a different name. What a racket, 
		for we were being introduced to the “brother” racket of much of the 
		world.<br><br>But on to Pompeii, over the cobbled streets lined with 
		dirty fly-infested stores. But behind the poor shabby shops we would 
		catch sight of extensive gardens and lovely summer homes. Our guide told 
		us that these are places where wealthy people spend their holidays. When 
		we asked him his name he pronounced it “John” but it turned out to be a 
		slurred Giovanni.<br><br>Soon we parked and walked toward the Pompeii 
		gate. Before entering we enjoyed a lunch of sandwiches and wine. One man 
		went to the trouble of leading us over to a bench, and thus doing an 
		unnecessary service for the reward he expected. I cite this as one of 
		the trials and tribulations of traveling afar, for it is done everywhere 
		and in the end is tiresome. We escaped the entrance fee because of 
		having our “tessers” which is part of the National Minister of 
		Education’s job in Rome. We had gone to a bit of trouble to get it and 
		it served us well in both Pompeii and Herculaneum<br><br>It seems that 
		Pompeii suffered destruction along with Herculaneum in 79 A.D. In 1748 
		the old city was discovered and then systematically excavated, until 
		more than half has been uncovered, and even completely restored in some 
		places. This is for the benefit of the tourist, of course. While we were 
		examining the pottery, green with age, as well as the various implements 
		in the Museum, our guide told us a bit of history.<br><br>The town was 
		founded by the “Griks” and later came under the Romans. In some places 
		we could see where the older construction had been partially demolished 
		by earthquakes. The Romans then built on top. Soon we were walking on 
		the streets of Pompeii. This is really the only thrilling part of the 
		show. The Basilica, Forum, temples are all still there, with a pillar or 
		two to give the general idea of went before. Dick and I took a drink 
		from a public fountain, where grooves were worn on the adjoining blocks 
		of stone where people rested their hands while taking a drink. The 
		bathhouses were intriguing. There is a frigitorium for the cold-blooded, 
		a hot room or sauna for the flappers, and the private rooms and waiting 
		rooms with marble benches and walls for the elite. The frigitorium was 
		circular with a hole in the top of the dome for illumination. The hot 
		rooms were different, for between double walls and floors, the steam was 
		piped in. Marred murals and tiled floors are all that remain.<br><br>
		Along the eastern side of the city stand the theaters, probably of Greek 
		origin. Three classes of seats include the loges, intermediates, and the 
		galleries. The very large theater is said to have been a place for 
		comedies, so the smaller and more serious public had a roof to exclude 
		the next-door laughs.<br><br>Bakeries and bars were numerous. The large 
		pottery containers that line the ruined shop fronts look like ice cream 
		vats, but probably were vats for something else. Ovens and primitive 
		grinders were in bakeries.<br><br>The houses of the wealthy were 
		elaborate. Everything surrounds the atrium, usually a large garden open 
		to the sky. The kitchen, dining room, guest rooms, sitting rooms, and 
		even the master’s den are all grouped around the atrium. Murals on the 
		walls, tiles and mosaics in the floors, statues and fountains, all are 
		part of the atrium. Pots and pans and ovens in the kitchen-all part of 
		the ancient home just as today. What’s new?<br><br>The palaces, which 
		Buliver in “the Last Days of Pompeii” describes, all have their 
		attractions, so it was fun to realize that all of the modern 
		conveniences are really not new, and perhaps 2000 years old. From the 
		grooves of wagon wheels in the cobblestones to the ancient pipes running 
		into the houses, we gained some insight that perhaps the wheel of 
		progress just goes around and around. On some of the mosaic thresholds 
		at house entrances, the word “Have”, pronounced “Harvey”, as a 
		southerner might say it is inscribed. Dad take note.<br><br>After three 
		hours, our guide reasoned that we had had enough, so out we went, a 
		little more educated, we hope.<br><br>Naples has many idiosyncrasies. 
		Bootblacks have their high chairs in the middle of the sidewalks. 
		Monkeys and organ grinders are everywhere. Everyone either walks, or 
		drives a wagon. The old section of town is just filthy, while the newer 
		part on the hill seems clean. Uniforms are everywhere. Nicely dressed 
		couples drive along the shore promenade, classy in one-horse carriages. 
		The streets are always under repair, for to drive on them means to dodge 
		pot holes. The weather has been bad, giving a drab effect to everything 
		that in realty can be beautiful. Flags add color. We haven’t heard many 
		tenors yet. There was one in a carpenter’s shop yesterday, and our guide 
		sang a few arias for us, and they love to be asked to sing Love Ted<br>
		<br><br>Ted May 9 Rome, and short Dick.<br><br>Back to Rome we motored 
		today with the Flannerys, leaving Naples at 11 AM and arriving here at 4 
		PM. We are beginning to despair about the weather, for the rain will not 
		let up. It is good to be back at our pensione. Our Naples experience has 
		been valuable. And we finally learned the full name of Mr. Flannery. It 
		is James Joseph Aloysius Flannery III. Isn’t that powerful? I was just 
		talking with the Mac Kinneys and they had seen Mr. Mulligan and the King 
		twice during the day of celebration here in Rome. We also hear that 
		tonight is the big night with lots of show so we shall see it.<br><br>
		Today has been especially interesting. Before leaving, Dick wrote to a 
		daughter in New York for the landlady who can’t write in English. The 
		letter concerned a recent marriage in the family and the latest Rome 
		news.<br><br>Our breakfasts are unique. About 7:30, our landlady brings 
		in our trays. Dick orders tea and I cocoa. We dunk our bread into the 
		tea or chocolate until we are satisfied. And then an orange purchased at 
		a fruit stand from the street below completes the meal. It is “multe 
		bella”, the constant Italian expression for satisfaction. In Naples 
		while waiting for the Flannerys we took some photos of our different 
		world here. Dick wanted to photo a fisherman, but lo and behold, five 
		youngsters, street waifs, demanded their picture. We herded them into 
		one place while Dick bluffed at fixing the camera, I tried to place them 
		into a group that would emphasize their best features. The picture 
		should be special for these were happy faces, despite their lives in 
		what we would consider a slum. They combed their hair and spiffed up, 
		and then for payment asked for cigarettes, the rule in Napoli.<br><br>In 
		order to gain a better view of the city, we climbed a hill up a winding 
		cobbled road. It was just the time when housewives were marketing and 
		bargaining with food vendors. There are two types of vending. One owns a 
		cart and sells from it. The other walks around, balancing on his head 
		his wares, vegetables or greens, singing or calling out his sales pitch 
		in a straining tenor voice.<br><br>The best looking moving company we 
		have yet seen was at a turn in the road. It was just a small truck piled 
		high with furniture. Below, in the main street of the city, soldiers 
		were marching. Every morning we hear trumpets outside, and rush out to 
		see regiments of soldiers mounted on bicycles, and with flying black 
		feathers in their caps, riding along slowly but surely. The state is 
		building a monument along the bay front and every morning is sounds like 
		an anvil chorus, the workmen pounding on the slabs.<br><br>About noon we 
		started after Mr. Flannery had tipped everyone in the hotel, a custom 
		and necessary one in the patterns of hotels over here. Of course it is a 
		lot of bunk, really just a ceremony, but foreigners are helpless to buck 
		it. We took the identical route of our trip down to Naples, but now 
		things looked different for some reason. Did it have something to do 
		with the day of the week? Happy farm scenes, full of industry; colorful 
		dresses in combinations of white, blue, and black; painted wagons; women 
		in the fields cutting clover; men on dinky donkeys; scads of 
		wildflowers; early fruit tree blossoms; hay wagons; small boys in 
		pinafores; girls in vividly colorful dresses on their ways to school. 
		These were some of the picturesque scenes as our Ford phaeton hummed 
		along. As we passed the school children they would wave in sort of a 
		salute and laugh happily when we would wave back. To add to their 
		costume loveliness, the women wear scarves over their heads, and the 
		men, wear a sheepskin slipper fashioned with leather thongs. Once we 
		passed a cyclist group or perhaps club, first we have seen.<br><br>
		Driving is very safe here because traffic is so small and the trees, 
		poles, and turns are all marked in black and white. As usual the weather 
		was rotten. It rained at intervals, heavy at times. We approached Rome 
		about 4 o’clock and were soon in town and bidding our hospitable friends 
		acquire. Another big dinner led to bed...Ted<br><br>T<br><br>Rome May 11 
		Cottica<br><br><br><br>This morning we presented ourselves to Col. 
		Cottica and the Rotary office. Tomorrow we go to Rotary. But this 
		morning we enjoyed meeting Major Overton’s friend. He is every bit the 
		fine gentleman Major Overton described. We talked awhile just to get 
		aquatinted and then he asked us to luncheon.<br><br>Returning at 12:30 
		after a ride to Garibaldi’s statue on the Juniculum, we found him 
		waiting and were soon being driven towards the Lido, or beach at Ostia. 
		Old Ostia is in ruins but a new municipality has grown up on the shore 
		and not yet ten years. During the delicious meal, which included three 
		kinds of wine, we discussed political affairs, Col. Cottica doing most 
		of the talking. He is a close friend of Mussolini, both having come from 
		the same region. Time and again he expressed his admiration for the man. 
		He gave us a little insight into Duce’s personality and character, as we 
		listened attentively, and as he added a few words about the fundamentals 
		of the Ethiopian dispute and the National Fascist Movement. We feel we 
		now have a little better understanding of the problem, having at the 
		same time respect for the Duce. Many times the Col. mentioned his close 
		friendship with Major Overton. “An unusually fine gentleman” was his 
		comment.<br><br>We liked Col. Cottica too. His personality and sense of 
		humor, and his desire to inform were backed up by his courtesies to us.<br>
		<br>At 3 o’clock we returned and have since succeeded in doing nothing. 
		Was it the wine? And why can’t he make the rain so? Won't it ever stop? 
		However, for the past hour-it is now seven-small birds that resemble 
		swallows have been swarming above the buildings around us. Are they 
		giving uis a message that really Spring has Sprung, and it is not just a 
		leak? Ted<br><br><br>May 13..Rome Ted<br><br><br><br>Its May 13th, and 
		our lucky number. Maybe things will turn up. This morning we tried to 
		see the Vatican Galleries, and without coats we failed. Afterwards we 
		called on our good friend at the Consulate, Mr. Blake, who offered us 
		his coats for the show. This morning we also contacted Bishop Hayes to 
		attempt to arrange an audience with the Pope. Tomorrow at 9:30, dressed 
		in borrowed coats, we carry a letter to the Vatican in the hope we will 
		be admitted. One way or another we will get there.<br><br>Rome is no 
		place to spend just a week. We have been here longer and yet there is so 
		much yet to be seen. Yesterday when we talked with Bishop Hanna he told 
		us that after the many years he has spent in Rome and among its 
		treasures, every day there is something new to be seen.<br><br>We have 
		just returned from the Museum of the Terme, situated among the vast 
		Diocletian Baths. At one time it was only of mediocre interest but 
		today, due to many additions, it is coming into its own. A new (old) 
		Venus which is truly beautiful beyond words, is becoming a more famous 
		work each day. It stands by itself in a small room, packed with 
		admirers. Another great work is the familiar figure of the pugilist 
		resting between rounds. Dick and I know it well, having felt the same 
		fatigue. Again the rendering of the musculature is its virtue. Of 
		course, the best known sculpture, the Terme Venus, is exceptional. Miss 
		Gallagher guided us through the rooms, educating us. We are beginning to 
		respond as we learn and appreciate a little more each day in an art 
		world the privilege of only the few to see.<br><br>Ted<br><br><br><br>
		May 13....Italy-Rotary Rome<br><br>Things are moving swiftly these days 
		as we try to clean up Rome, although we have just started, before moving 
		on to Florence, stopping at Assisi and Perugia en route. Right now, 
		quite a bit of time has been taken up seeing people and making 
		arrangements that might have important results. General Cottica is a 
		great help, a real gentleman, as Major Overton says, and always his 
		staunch friend. Every time we see him he asks if we have written yet and 
		to be sure and give the Major his best. He must be an example of the 
		best in Rome leadership, tremendously busy but always with a few minutes 
		for us.<br><br>“You are always at home in my office” was his comment 
		when we left yesterday.<br><br><br><br>May 12<br><br><br><br>Believe it 
		or not, we were on our bikes and away at 8 o’clock this morning. General 
		Cottica had spoken of the new Fero Mussolini (Forum) at lunch yesterday, 
		insisting that we see it. So at this early hour we were quickly 
		perspiring while covering several miles to the Fore on the Tiber’s banks 
		outside of Rome’s northern walled entrance, Porta del Popolo. It was a 
		thrill to see this shining white marble monument of modern Italy in the 
		form of athletic training grounds for the youth. Every sport is 
		represented. Modernistic design is carried out to the n’th degree in the 
		gorgeous buildings decorated with mosaics depicting athletic figures and 
		contests. Playing fields are surrounded by glistening white marble 
		stands. The Fero covers several square miles and since it is now in the 
		middle of construction, landscaping has not been started. What a sports 
		haven we hope it will eventually turn out to be. Clay tennis courts are 
		surrounded by marble grandstands topped with twelve foot milk white 
		statues depicting sports in their primitive forms. This same design is 
		carried out around the giant athletic field, with a second one under 
		construction. Beautiful buildings in the same style house fencing 
		courts, swimming pools, wrestling rings, etc. not to mention locker 
		rooms for the vast army of athletes now working out all around us. In 
		the distance, echoing rifle fire told us that target practice is a major 
		part of the training activities. Il Duce is taking seriously this manner 
		of building an active manhood that will dutifully follow his policies. 
		Greek athletes had no finer places to train and compete than the youth 
		of Rome today. Fero Mussolini can only be considered a revelation, 
		saying more about modern Italy than any guides or books.<br><br>Brother 
		Connolly and Mr. O’Connel had informed us that Archbishop Hanna is in 
		Rome, taking a vacation from the responsibilities in San Francisco, so 
		we took the opportunity to call on him. He graciously received us, 
		making us feel at home. We had an interesting conversation with him for 
		45 minutes, and especially enjoyed his comments on Italy and present 
		events.<br><br>In relation to the Foro Mussolini, the Archbishop made an 
		especially interesting comment.<br><br>“Mussolini has a tremendous 
		burden to carry. He must not only deal with problems of today, but must 
		prepare for the future. Added to this is the problem of being alert and 
		guarding against attack. Such an institution is the Foro, stimulating 
		athletics and building a competitive spirit which will serve to line up 
		Italian youth behind him. It is most interesting to note that Italy, 2/3 
		the size of California, has a many times larger population.<br><br>On 
		the way back, we stopped for an hour or so in the famous Borghese 
		Gallery, once the casino of the Villa Borghese, now a favorite as a 
		promenade through its gardens. Among the special works in sculpture are 
		Bernini’s “Apollo and Daphne” and “David” and of course the seductive 
		reclining figure of Pauline Borghese, easily the most to our liking. 
		Ancient mosaics depict gladiator contests that told us much about the 
		armor and weapons of that day. Among the great works are Titian’s 
		“Sacred and Profane Love”, Raphael’s “Entombment”, and Corregio’s 
		“Danao”. Several Michelangelo’s also can be enjoyed. Here our tesseras 
		stood us in good stead, saving a few coppers for our coffers.<br><br>
		Today was Rotary in Rome. Having been invited to the meeting by the 
		secretary, at Dad’s behest. We arrived at the Hotel Excelsior, slicked 
		up in our latest ensambles-pants, same shirts, same sweaters- and we 
		were on time. The meeting was held in the spacious dining room where the 
		meal was delicious, of course, topped off with champagne toasts to 
		Italy, the King, and Il Duce. Only 3 or 4 members spoke English so our 
		conversation was limited. Mr.Zenardi, the club’s founder, and 
		Mr.Giovanni(Mr. Jones of Italy) told us interesting things about the 
		club’s history. First of all it has a record-breaking attendance of 
		30%(lowest in the world) because they claim that they have so many big 
		guns as members and they find it hard to attend. The King is an honorary 
		member. However, the way the meeting was carried on, we would attribute 
		the poor attendance just to lack of interest, as with any mutual 
		admiration society. Rotary in America is far ahead of the rest of the 
		world, to the point that there is no comparison, as far as we can tell. 
		A few members across from us actually were going to sleep. We felt as if 
		we were intruding, and further, that the time and trouble necessary for 
		us to make this type of contact and to explain our position in clubs is 
		not worth the value received. Only in special cases do we plan to attend 
		from now on, feeling out of temper with the Rotarians seen thus far in 
		Europe. This may sound harsh, but it is the way we presently feel and we 
		know you wish the facts. Perhaps the club had an off day, but 30% 
		attendance speaks for itself. Only a few members wore their pins 
		alongside Fascisti emblems. This club seemed to have just one goal, 
		likely to be prestige alone.<br><br>After competing our business about 
		the city, we pedaled by the Coliseum, Arch of Constantine over Via dei 
		Trionfi recently constructed by soldiers, oddly, to the Baths(Termae) of 
		Caracalla, largest mass of ruins in Rome, save for the Coliseum. They 
		were begun in 212 AD by Caracalla and finished by Severus as they cover 
		more than six acres and accommodate 1600 bathers at a time. Many works 
		of art were found but now are in museums, Naples gaining the largest 
		collection. These baths, or Termae, were really the 19th holes of 
		yesterday where one could find stores, restaurants, and art exhibits, 
		not to mention great rooms to sit and gossip while being served peppy 
		liquids. They were the meeting house for the middle class and the 
		wealthy. All that remains now are great walls and arches, all of thin 
		Roman bricks, and overgrown with grass and weeds. A few mosaic floors 
		remain but have weathered badly as ceilings disintegrate over the 
		scarred and fragmented capitals of melting columns.<br><br>It was here 
		that Shelly wrote his Prometheus Unbound, dreaming in the shadows as 
		night would fall. Keats and Shelly are both buried in Rome in the little 
		cemetery beside Porta Paola near the Tiber at the city’s eastern end.<br>
		<br>As the afternoon was still young enough for some more wandering, we 
		retraced our steps back to the Coliseum to give it our first real 
		inspection and perhaps dream a little too as evening shadows bring 
		gladiators and to be martyred Christians into the arena. Although it may 
		seen strange, but rather than listen to the lists of facts from guides’ 
		lips we just like to pick a suitable spot in a moment such as this, 
		glean a little history from our guide book, then sit and let 
		imaginations roam. We fill the stadium with colorful cheering crowds 
		above, roaring lions below, fighting men or racing chariots as we try to 
		place ourselves in that day when the mere raising or lowering of a royal 
		thumb meant life or death.<br><br>The Coliseum is just as it is 
		pictured, the greatest ruin in Rome, built by Vespasian in the First 
		Century, a remarkable wonderful construction “first”. It will hopefully 
		stand for the centuries ahead. It is just as solid today as ever. Forty 
		to fifty thousand people filled the stadium to witness blood curdling 
		events put on by the rich and powerful, and all for political purposes. 
		A satisfied populace meant popularity and thus power. There really is 
		nothing to say about its construction that can’t be found in any 
		encyclopedia. At one time it was a fortress and the arena floor was, for 
		the moment in time, covered with masonry.<br><br>Spectacular views down 
		radiating thoroughfares, the Vittorio Emanuel Monument, Arch of 
		Constantine, the Foro of the Emperors, are received from the Coliseums 
		highest points. Hard to believe but entrance was free, with our 
		“iessaros,” to all these wonders. Best money’s worth yet! <br><br>As 
		evening fell, thousands of sparrows filled the air spinning and singing. 
		To the east, promenaders enjoyed quiet walks through spacious public 
		gardens that can be found throughout Rome. From where we stood we were 
		looking over where the spacious grounds, making up half of Rome at the 
		time, were serenaded by Nero while Rome burned.<br><br>(Time out to wash 
		socks while water is hot)<br><br><br><br>We were enjoying ourselves so 
		much that closing time of 6 o’clock slipped by for ten minutes before we 
		noticed. On reaching the gate below we found ourselves locked in. 
		Imagine being locked in the Coliseum, even if you are a hungry Lyon. All 
		we could do was roar through the bars. And then a soldier passed by, and 
		with gestures we conveyed are plight and the need for rescue. He came 
		back with the attendant who luckily had a sense of humor and freed us 
		with a chuckle.<br><br>There were still a few unexposed pictures on the 
		camera roll. In order to use them up, we rode down the boulevard between 
		the Forum Romanum and Forum Augustis to the Vittoio Emanuel Monument. It 
		is a singularly impressive structure of white marble, with gilded 
		statues blackening with age. Some witty sole made the comment that the 
		Monument looked like a lower plate of false teeth, the columns the 
		teeth. Ever since that far-fetched name has stuck. So, it was up behind 
		the first and second lateral incisors that we took several shots of the 
		sunset behind St. Peters and for the first time were asked for our 
		passports and “sojarne” card by a plainclothes policeman. No problem.<br>
		<br>The Monument is far more impressive from a distance, for already the 
		inlaid marble floors are deteriorating and the gold blackening, Passing 
		down the steps we paused for a moment to pay our respects at the Unknown 
		Soldier’s Grave, decorated simply and beautifully, two fully equipped 
		soldiers standing guard. The memorial is at the bottom of the first 
		flight of stairs and always easily accessible, beautiful at dusk with 
		its Guard of Honor.<br><br>After a delicious dinner at 7:30, we found 
		ourselves dead tired and went right to bed. It doesn’t seem as if we are 
		doing much as we go along, but after an hour at supper, we realize what 
		a full day it has been. We still have 12 days before we leave for Assisi 
		on Sunday morning. Time flies fast, so we must make hay during these 
		last days in Italy, hoping to cross the border on the 28th into 
		Switzerland. How fast we will be able to ride over the Alps remains to 
		be seen.<br><br>Please tell President Roosevelt to hurry up and 
		stabilize the dollar. With it worth just 59 cents over here, our living 
		is expensive and when I say “living” I mean not only food but the other 
		necessities such as clothes, toothpaste, and film. We will have spent 
		during one month in italy(33 days) about $180, including railroad 
		tickets-more than $5 a day. However, cutting everything to a minimum, 
		despite such expenditures as 160 lira for pants, 44 lira for shoes to be 
		soled, and 18 lira for a roll of film, it all adds up in the end. If 
		everything goes as we hope, on leaving Italy we will have $370 left, 
		which plus your extra $100, ought to do the job. Living is cheap in 
		Germany, expensive in France, Switzerland, and Holland. We will keep the 
		latch tight on the Lyon Brothers” cash in our money belts, itchy when we 
		sweat, but safe. Of course plans change every minute it seems, and with 
		the latest hope to go to Ireland to see our friend in Cork, we will have 
		to speed things up. Here is the latest for you to send letters. Just 
		think, we have not heard a word from you since Marseilles, and won’t 
		until Venice where we have had mail forwarded from Geneva.(Its raining 
		cats and dogs again) Please write to each city along our route. We are 
		always able to have mail changed or forwarded. We should be in Geneva 
		about June 3, Zurich on June 11, and Munich on the 16th.<br><br>There is 
		an awful lot to do, and if time is passing. We will likely leave out 
		Ireland. It just depends on what we do each day. We figure we ride 20 
		kms. and hour, about 12 miles per hour, if we don’t stop. That was our 
		average over the Riviera hills.<br><br>After Munich please write to 
		Nuremburg. Whether we will make the Olympics is doughtful. If we follow 
		the schedule, we should be in England the very last of July. The more we 
		think about it, we doubt we can either afford the time or the money for 
		Berlin Olympics..<br><br>(Boy, its really thundering outside-rattles the 
		windows-Hope this will break the rainy spell.)<br><br>Reservations have 
		been made for the Aquaitania-our NYK tickets and $20 for two. We could 
		have gone on a smaller 8 day ship , but figured the days here are too 
		valuable. We have to look ahead because the ships are filling up.<br>
		<br>On telling of the Termae Museum, Ted left out the Discus Thrower, 
		probably the most justly famous piece in the Museum. The original is 
		scarred and broken, his feet, head, and most of his arms gone. His body 
		is as beautiful as ever, not overdone nor musclebound as are so many of 
		these strong men. Beside him stands the modern bronze completed as the 
		original must have looked in white marble. It is a thrill to see such 
		original Greek sculpture as it depicts the athlete centuries ago. Fine 
		judgment was used in not trying to restore it in the way so many 
		wonderful pieces have been disfigured. The bronze replica served that 
		need.<br><br>These are just haphazard comments that slip out. Rome is 
		overrun with Germans and Swiss these days, evidently seeking some 
		warmth. Rome is sultry. Every time we ride our bikes we perspire 
		profusely, especially as we carry them up the two flights of our 
		Pensione. We are studying German these days in preparation for great 
		experiences in Deutschland ahead.<br><br>School for Bruce will be over 
		by the time we reach geneva. Tell us your summer plans. Dick<br><br><br>
		May 14 Rome Ted St. Angelo<br><br><br><br>This morning we carried a 
		letter of introduction from Bishop Hayes to gain a general audience with 
		the Pope. But Saturday is the day set and we pedaled to the Vatican only 
		to be turned away by the gorgeous Swiss Guards. It was on our way back 
		that I had some near miss episodes. The first happened when a cycler cut 
		in front of me and my brake was not punctual enough. I just lay over his 
		back fender in graceful style, then picked myself up and tried to say 
		&quot;Damn you and pardon me” in fifty different languages. You know my 
		temper. Well, the second time a fellow sneaked up on me from behind as 
		we were going down one of Rome’s side streets, and I swerved out, nearly 
		spilling us. It was useless for both of us to talk so dirty glances 
		sufficed. By this time I was in a sweat when around another corner and 
		on the wrong side, a rider came at me. ”Kerfluey”, with my quick stop 
		handlebars went forward as did I, and over them. Luckily our destination 
		was nearby so I was able to make the rest of the way on foot. Sometimes 
		in using our front wheel hand brakes, when we apply them firmly, because 
		the brake handle is on top instead of on the underside, a quick stop has 
		us moving forward, putting more unwanted pressure on the handles, and we 
		somersault, and land on our backs as occurred the other day when the 
		Carabinieri put his hand up. Both of us lay flat on our backs at his 
		sides, and everyone had a laugh, motorists, Carabinieri, and we as well,<br>
		<br>Today we bought a German grammar and are beginning our study. It is 
		raining and we are writing. Can you imagine that here in the middle of 
		May it’s pouring.<br><br>We have ordered a USA sign for our bikes just 
		in case they can ever be useful.<br><br>This afternoon we journeyed to 
		the Capitoline Museum. We wished to get another look at the “Flying 
		Gaul” and to go through the Palace of the Conservatori where the figure 
		of the boy bent over to get a thorn out of his foot and the bronze mold 
		of Romulus and Remus are found. Of course all the other wonders are 
		there too from tapestries to works by Reni, Van Dyke, Rubens, 
		Tintoretto, and Bassane, plus all the usual frescoes and mosaics.<br>
		<br>Then Dick’s bike chain broke. As you see we have an eventful life 
		even if we have to create the events<br><br>Tomorrow we go to the 
		Vatican Galleries. The Consul’s coats fit fine though they are baggy in 
		the shoulders. A ride out to Hadrian’s Villa will occupy the afternoon. 
		Saturday, we hope to meet the Pope. Sunday we will shuffle off to 
		Assisi, Perugia, and Florence.<br><br><br><br>Evening<br><br><br><br>
		After lunch we visited Hadrian’s tomb, now properly called the Castle of 
		St. Angelo. It was begun by Hadrian and completed by his successor, 
		Antoninus Pius. At first it was used as a mausoleum, but then became a 
		refuge for the Popes in times of siege, numerous to say the least. A 
		passage led to it from the Vatican and the Popes did flee through it. 
		One time there was a terrible plague in Rome. The Pope led a procession 
		by the Castle and when they passed the fortress, St. Michael appeared 
		above, sheathing his sword, and the plague ended. Ever since it has been 
		known as the Castle St.Angelo in memory of the angel saint.<br><br>In 
		order to reach the Museum and rooms of the Pope inside, we had to wind 
		up through a cold gloomy tunnel. The collections were interesting, and 
		the small dungeons like Chateau d'If were full of mystery. From the top 
		we had an excellent view of St.Peters and Rome itself. On our way back 
		into the city, we stopped at the Rag Market, just a number of booths 
		placed in the maze of streets in the city’s center. As we pushed our 
		bikes through everyone would stare at us, and all we could do was stare 
		back. They tried to sell us everything, but we weren’t in the market for 
		The market. Every shop in town is supposed to have a booth at this 
		market, surely unusual.<br><br>We then rode across town to the Church of 
		San Clemente. An English priest took us down to the lower church which, 
		recently uncovered, is said to be of the fourth century. He then took us 
		even further down, until we heard running water. No one knows from where 
		it comes, so it remains a mystery. To a Californian it is just another 
		artisan well.<br><br>He showed us portions of not yet excavated 
		buildings that date from the Imperial Age of 700 to about 500 BC,,nd 
		just above, buildings of the Republican age, 500 BC to 46 BC. One small 
		room the priest told us was the home of St. Clemente. When he was 
		banished from Rome, the pagans erected an alter in the room to their Sun 
		God, which still stands in the center. What a fertile field for a 
		fertile mind to write about.<br><br>We finished another remarkable day, 
		tired and sleepy, and to bed.<br><br><br>May 18 Perugia Really Rome Dick<br>
		<br>It has been a number of days since we have had time to sit down and 
		write. The last few days in Rome were packed with a such a series of 
		experiences that a few spare minutes were not found. We are in the 
		ancient hill town of Perugia, some hundred miles north of Florence. Ted 
		will tell you of our first impressions and of the great day we visited 
		the Vatican Museum and its wondrous collection of sculpture and art.<br>
		<br>It opened at 9 and wishing to spend as much time as possible there, 
		we dressed quickly, spiffed up in Mr. Blake’s double breasted coats, 
		carried our bikes down the stairs-the two flights we call the last mile, 
		for if we aren’t perspiring before climbing them, the top will find us 
		both puffing and sopping wet. We started pedaling when “bang”, something 
		went off below me. My chain was lying in the street, not caring whether 
		or not we got to the Vatican. Back up the last mile because we could not 
		fix the chain without links. I ran again to catch the bus, while Ted 
		rode over on his bike.<br><br>The Vatican Galleries and Museum are 
		tremendous, with their untold wealth of art. There are just a few, 
		however, that we wish to specially remember. The works of Raphael-his 
		stanza containing the School of Athens- and ‘Confirmation of the Holy 
		Sacrament”. Works on Constantine’;s life were surprises and interesting. 
		In this, emotions on each face give a feeling of intense emotion. The 
		“Loggia” of Raphael,, corridors decorated with frescoes illustrating 45 
		scenes from the Bible, held our attention especially. The Sistine Chapel 
		with Michelangelo's works is beyond awe inspiring. The tremendous “Last 
		Judgment” and ceiling covered with frescoes cannot be forgotten.<br><br>
		In the picture gallery, Rafael's “Transfiguration” and “Madonna del 
		Feligno” and Dammenlurie’s “The Last Communion of St. jerome” and in 
		sculpture, the familiar “Laocoon” were most appreciated by us. This is 
		just a hasty sketch but time limits such a tale. Dad, Mom, Bruce–as you 
		read our letters you should have the Encyclopedia open and read there 
		about we see and can’t really describe.<br><br>The early afternoon was 
		spent completing our business- getting steamship tickers on the 
		Aquitania, films, money. At four we wandered down into the Forum Romanum 
		to stay there as shadows fell. We sat for awhile beneath the lone 
		beautiful column of P.... rising high above the surrounding ruins is the 
		speakers’ rostrum from which Cicero thundered at Catline, Arch of 
		Severus, and grave of Romulus. Above this the eight columns of Saturn 
		still stand. We then wandered through the remains of the Temple of Vesta 
		and admired the three columns with still rich entablature of Castor and 
		Pollux. We just strolled and lapped it all up, trying to picture the 
		grass covered ruins as they were when Caesar started his Basilica Julia. 
		At 6:30 we were shooed out by the attendant but still climbed up on some 
		ruins overlooking the Forum and enjoyed the sunset to its fullest. This 
		has been the most wonderful day since our arrival in Rome.<br><br>After 
		dinner, tripod and camera in hand, we ambled the kilometer to the 
		Coliseum, and after studying it from every angle, and exploring for a 
		few moments in its oily depths, we took a time exposure from a point 
		overlooking the broad well-lighted avenue running to the Vittorio 
		Emanuel Monument to the west. A shot of Constantine’s well lit arch 
		completed the evening’s photo attempts, followed by a frappe(Italian 
		watery milkshake) between the two of us. They still can’t make a 
		milkshake anywhere at Eddy's but in California.<br><br><br><br>May 16<br>
		<br>Our last day was to prove a full one. Up early, we rode (I found a 
		link for the chain made in America and it fit the French design for 
		once) to San Givanni in Laterno, the leading church of Rome, ahead of 
		St. Peter’s in ecclesiastical standards. It is up until the present, the 
		Pope was confirmed first as a Bishop of Rome, a necessary step to being 
		named the Pope. However, the church itself was not as interesting as the 
		Baptistry and Cloisters of its adjacent monastery.<br><br>An attendant 
		took around the small circular Baptistry, telling us that this building 
		is the oldest of its kind in Rome. It is believed that Constantine was 
		baptized here. In one of the side chapels can be seen the oldest mosaics 
		in Rome, somewhat coarser but just as rich as later ones. The attendant 
		held a lighted match against one the small alter pillars, causing the 
		stone to light up with its translucent qualities. He explained that the 
		pillars are of alabaster, their translucency being the test.<br><br>The 
		musical doors fascinated us,<br><br>each weighing 1400 pounds. and 
		constructed of gold, silver, and copper As they were swung clear, 
		thundering notes issue forth, at times just plain beautiful. Because 
		they were so heavy, we felt the guide earned his lira tip, something we 
		are rarely able to do.<br><br>The monastery cloisters are beautiful, 
		much the same as in “:St.Paul’s Outside The Walls”-small marble columns 
		each of a different color and mineral content, and they enclosed the 
		beautifully tended inner garden.<br><br>This trip has been a wonderful 
		revelation to us, so surrounded by the oldest and the new, exposing what 
		we don’t know and acting as a stimulus for study.<br><br>Our next 
		surprise was a quick glance at Santa Croce and Santa Ascala wherein are 
		the marble steps brought by St. Helena to Rome from Palestine, the 
		stones on which Christ was supposed to have stood before Pontius Pilate. 
		One may ascend them, and there are many, only on one’s knees. The wooden 
		covers of the steps are hollowed and smooth from worshipers’ knees. Ten 
		were ascending and praying as we watched. Of course the ever-present 
		postcard and curio vender is close at hand. You find them clustered at 
		every historical tourist point. If they can’t speak English, at the 
		least a “Hello” makes the introduction. I am afraid though that we have 
		not proved a boon the International Pest Association.<br><br>Back at the 
		Pension again we slicked up in Mr. Blake’s coats, ran the polishing rag 
		over our shoes, put on garters and ties, and were all set to meet the 
		Pope. On bikes again, we picked up our letter of Introduction at Bishop 
		Hayes’ office, and rode slowly, so as not to sweat, to the Vatican. It 
		was no use, though, for if we rode slowly our backs became frying pans , 
		and if we rode faster for a little breeze, nothing changed save more 
		sweat. What a great day when shorts will outfit us again, seeming to be 
		a custom of American origin.<br><br>The Vatican entrance is adjacent to 
		St. Peters steps at the end of the row of columns circling the plaza. 
		There we received our first view of the famous Swiss Guards, dressed in 
		gay colored uniforms from medieval days. Their head=gear is just as 
		brilliant, looking like glorified berets at rakish angles. Several wore 
		shining swords, while others stood at attention, pikes in hand. Every 
		major language is spoken by these fellows. We had no trouble in finding 
		one who could speak English.<br><br>Our letter was addressed to Father 
		Clark, who without ado gave us our card to attend the general audience 
		with the Pope. While waiting we made the acquaintance of a young 
		American student in the Priesthood Jim McKugo from Chicago who was 
		obtaining an audience for another American from his home town. Since an 
		hour of sitting was necessary, he took us through St. Peters explaining 
		clearly to us the meaning of Catholic beliefs and doctrines. At 12 we 
		returned to the Vatican waiting room with Mr. Palette, Tom’s friend. We 
		passed the guards once more and then up a beautiful staircase and 
		through gorgeous rooms covered with equally gorgeous frescoes, and then 
		more guards at a room where, to our amazement, several hundred people 
		sat or walked about, all waiting to receive the Pope’s blessing. 
		Evidently our audience was to be anything but private. While we waited, 
		several people came out from an adjoining room in full dress,They were, 
		without doubt, returning from a truly private audience with His 
		Holiness.<br><br>After several false alarms, the doors finally opened, 
		and we were admitted into a spacious audience hall. again richly 
		decorated from top to bottom, with the Popes chair on a plush covered 
		platform, at a point nearest us. While standing in the crowd waiting, we 
		had plenty of time to observe those around us. Our height, of course 
		thanks to orange juice and Kepler’s Malt Extract, again stood us in good 
		stead, for we could see so much. All about us, petite women in black, 
		their heads covered with intricate handwork scarves, some perhaps from 
		Sorrento, craned eagerly forward. Swiss Guards, their backs to us, stood 
		holding everyone in line, leaving a large free space around His 
		Holiness’ chair. Guards were at every door. Since cameras are forbidden 
		and we needed some remembrance of the Guards. Here is a sketch made as 
		we waited The Guard had his back to us. Hope you can recognize him (Back 
		of helmut and pike)<br><br>Perhaps you have been able to gain some idea 
		of just how colorful these gentlemen are in red, blue, and yellow, with 
		black steel helmets and shining pikes. As we stood, suddenly a “SH” 
		passed through the crowd and all stood silently as the doors to the 
		right slowly opened. Again, modern smartly uniformed officers appeared, 
		followed by Pope Pius IX in a white robe and white skullcap. He walked 
		slowly and majestically to his chair, seated himself, and was of course 
		surrounded by his “Guard of of Honor”. He pronounced quietly his 
		benediction with right hand raised, and promptly left the room with the 
		same quiet tread. It was over so quickly that we never really caught up. 
		What was the biggest surprise was the clapping as he appeared and left. 
		Just a few kneeled for the benediction. We also paid our homage and 
		kneeled as we had been told to do. No difficulty with that. The Pope 
		spoke feebly, his words barely audible. There is so little for us to 
		say, for it all happened so fast. our surprise so great that we never 
		really put it all together. When it was over, the room filled with 
		excited mutterings as we emptied out into the corridor. Pope Pius is 
		getting vary old and these audiences must be very tiring for him He is a 
		quite wonderful and kindly man, beloved and venerated by the entire 
		Christian world. He has every right to this adoration. Here is another 
		scribble-his red plush chair burnished with gold, yet its beauty so 
		simple. I forgot to mention that the guards had handsome displays of 
		medals to twinkle and shine.<br><br>We had received the Pope’s blessing, 
		and now we feel our visit to Rome is complete. So, off to Tivoli and 
		Hadrian’s Villa 50 kilometers away(about 10 miles) filled the afternoon. 
		We had so looked forward to these treasures, although most have been 
		removed and are in museums around the world. Above was blue sky and 
		sunshine. Just ahead was a black sky as ominous clouds poured down 
		torrents of rain. As we felt the dripping water getting inside our 
		inadequate protective clothing we would stop, let the downpour stop, and 
		then sort of follow along again in a beautiful countryside that first 
		appeared as we were traveling north from Rome. Water glistened in the 
		sunshine, accentuating the green-red, and yellow of the springtime 
		landscape. Tall slender cypress’ and poplars gave a pastoral effect to 
		each farmyard, a crooked fence, and grazing cattle-just another haven 
		for artists, if it weren't for the rows of telephone lines everywhere. 
		But the artist has the advantage not allowed the photographer, for these 
		modern eyesores are overlooked by their brushes.<br><br>On the outskirts 
		of Rome we passed clean new apartments and office buildings, in the most 
		modern designs. There are simply hundreds of these in Rome.<br><br>Of 
		course everyone gawks as we pass, politely surprising their laughter at 
		the two giraffes making time on bikes. Peaceful repose was exhibited by 
		wagon drivers, snoozing contentedly, mouths agape, as their faithful 
		donkeys pulled along steadily. We’re sure that the seats of these men’s 
		pants must be nailed to the boards to keep them from falling out as they 
		swing rhythm back and forth.<br><br>The most remarkable characteristic 
		of Hadrian’s Villa is its symmetry and landscaping, all situated on a 
		broad hill overlooking the valley. Even today, overgrown and fairly well 
		kept, it is a superb sight. Statuesque cypress’ add most to the 
		picturesqueness as they cluster around colossal ruins. It is the peace 
		and quiet that pervades everything that is most impressive, a consistent 
		quality of the Roman hill through which we have ridden so far. As for 
		the ruins themselves, just a few words. The grounds are extensive and 
		cover acres of rolling ground with some remains of extensive structures 
		everywhere, apparently built for the enjoyment of the populace itself, 
		as they enjoyed the Emperor’s hospitality. We see massive floors in 
		black and white, with tiny bits of marble, all well preserved, their 
		geometrical designs still fresh. Only traces of all and ceiling frescoes 
		remain, now covered with the inescapable sightseers’ signatures. 
		Hadrian’s Villa is an illuminating view into the past, gowned with 
		natures robes ot the present. This Emperor seems to us not fully 
		appreciated for he left something of which he could be proud.<br><br>Six 
		o’clock found us back on the road, once more pumping towards Rome. Our 
		legs wanted to stop but stomachs said “Not yet”. Of course we did stop 
		here and there for a photo. About 2/3 of the way in we passed a couple 
		of local bikers riding along leisurely. But, guess what, they 
		immediately stepped on the gas to stay follow in our wake and take 
		advantage of our backwash. We decided to leave them far behind. So we 
		pumped as hard as we could. They stuck like lePage’s glue, smiling all 
		the time. After several miles up a slight grade, our not yet conditioned 
		legs pled for help, and then the cobblestones began. That topped things 
		off. Every stone felt like a boulder, and America would have to be 
		humbled. Just when the old pistons were ready to quit, Italy turned down 
		a side street to wave and laugh, leaving us still in front but the worse 
		for wear. We covered the distance back in a short 1 1/4 hour. After 
		another satisfying dinner, with legs and all else wilting, we hit the 
		sack-a fitting end to our fullest day yet in Rome.<br><br>PS Pension 
		Giuliana at 26 Via Palermo--these are the personalities-Italian, Swiss, 
		German, Austrian, English, French, Scotch. Dutch, Cypriots, Russian, and 
		American. Dick<br><br><br>May 18 Assisi Perugia Ted<br><br><br><br><br>
		<br>It is morning as we wait for breakfast to be brought to our room. 
		Yesterday was a climbing day as we were first introduced to the hill 
		towns. We arose early, packed and ate a good breakfast and said goodbye 
		to the smiling frauliens who had taken such good care of us in Pensione 
		Giulliana. Finding the baggage office in the large Rome station just a 
		few minutes before the train’s departure was exciting. At 7:30 the train 
		pulled out and from that itime one we had a most enjoyable morning, 
		riding over the compagne and up a flood plain while the river meandered 
		with us in zigzag fashion and into the foothills of Assisi. At one place 
		we thought we were back in California for the morning sunshine 
		emphasized the beauty of a field of those glorious red poppies. Grain 
		fields dotted with wild flowers lay over the countryside like a quilt, 
		and fruit trees with vine clad wires strung from tree to tree divided 
		the landscape in an irregular pattern. What an abundance of 
		picturesqueness surrounded us while on the train, and in our car a 
		little drama was progressing. Evidently, the church young women’s guild 
		of Spoligna was out on a binge to Assisi. They boarded the train by 
		storm with a priest leading them, swarming through every compartment 
		door. Finding seats was an amusing problem, at least so they thought, 
		and as for Dick some of these dainty country maids were nearly in his 
		lap. Although the morning was still young they had to open their small 
		cases and bring out loaves of bread-cake, which having been cut with a 
		kitchen knife and handled by three or four people, proceeded to 
		disappear in a very few mouthfulls. Then came the wine, toted by one 
		bosomed maid who generously offered us some. But since everyone was 
		drinking out of the same glass, we had lost our thirst. To make things 
		more interesting, as we were still at in our seats, a large group 
		gathered and made us the objects of their conversation. Then and there 
		we were sorry we didn’t know a little Italian. But were got our licks 
		in. The conductor, as he came through, turned to us and fired some 
		Italian We weren’t sure of what he had said, but answered simultaneously 
		“Assisi”, for that seemed the likely correct answer to any question a 
		conductor might ask. W were right for the conductor nodded and went on 
		his way, but the girls now thought we knew Italian and had understood 
		all of their gossip. They became shame-faced and continued talking in a 
		hushed fones while we chuckled. They were nice girls, very hardy and 
		with strong faces. Their clothes were very plain and in most cases were 
		probably hand-me-downs from older sisters. Two small girls in bright 
		dresses to match their ruddy cheeks, stared at us as though we were 
		freaks. None of them gave any evidence of having ever ridden in a train 
		before.<br><br>Time passed quickly and Assisi popped into view. There on 
		the the point was the massive gothic structure-the Church of San 
		Francisco, where the crypt holds St. Francis. You can imagine how we 
		felt living such a short distance from our own St. Francis just across 
		the bay. To the south the gray town stretched along the heights. 
		Standing out above is the Castle Maggiore, the original guardian of the 
		town<br><br>The train stopped and we were again on the go. We stopped 
		beneath fruit trees in a verdant orchard to eat our lunch of ham and 
		cheese sandwiches, hard-boiled eggs, and oranges. It was one of our most 
		delightful experiences, just sitting there, with Assisi in the distance, 
		Spring colors surrounded us, and snow white clouds floated above. But 
		all suddenly became dark as Dick proceeded to change film and something 
		snapped. It had to be the film. It was stuck. Nothing can be so dire and 
		depressing to a photographer as to have destroyed negatives that cannot 
		be created again.<br><br>Up to the town we climbed, hoping to find a 
		spot dark enough to make the film change. It was Sunday, and noon, and 
		all shops were closed, but we found what we were for in the black recess 
		of an old watch-tower. We had climbed to the Castle where a small boy 
		with five large keys and a lantern led us into the stronghold. We were 
		not as much interested in in the castle remains as we were in finding a 
		medieval dark room. Oh, for the life of a photographer! We were 
		beginning to despair when he started off to a hole in a corner. We 
		followed and found ourselves in a long tunnel to a watch-tower out on 
		the precipitous point. And, by the way it is no place for orange juice 
		drinkers from California, for ceilings were dangerously low There in the 
		dark recesses of circular staircase, Dick changed the film.<br><br>All 
		was bright once more as we hiked back into town to take pictures of the 
		bounty of our first hill town. Clean winding streets which many times 
		ended in descending steps, led us past neat plain houses. On every 
		windowsill were potted plants and greens. Pleasant people watched us 
		pass, always with a good natured smile, sometimes accompanied with 
		“bonjourno”. Down among the gray tiled roofs,with interesting doorways 
		and intriguing passages, and inviting lace and metal shops, we found 
		ourselves at the Church Of San Francisco. At every turn we caught sight 
		of the plain below extending into the hazy distance. A muddy twisting 
		riverbed wiggled off to the right, the railroad station directly below 
		surrounded by a carpet of green with orchards rising out of the 
		grain-what a picture!<br><br>We entered the church, beautified by the 
		brushes ot the wondrous noted artists of Italy. Our interest lay in 
		seeing the lower church and the crypt where St. Francis lies. We 
		descended to the chapel where many young monks were holding a service. 
		Then, dark stairs led us down to the crypt. Outside the iron-grated 
		doors we stood transfixed. An alter, so beautiful with fresh flowers, 
		stood at the extremity of the small chapel. Faintly burning oil lamps in 
		groups of three hung from the ceiling on either side, and down the 
		stairway from the chapel overhead came the echoing chants of a hundred 
		voices in answer to the sole chanter’s call. An opening above the alter 
		illuminated it and added the final touch. It was great. Everything was 
		so quiet until the chanting broke the stillness to again and again 
		making it in fact an enchanting experience.<br><br>The walk back to the 
		station was a joy. We were at peace with the world. Near the station we 
		stopped for a time in the Church of Santa Maria Dogli Angeli where under 
		its dome is the hut in which St. Francis and his followers worshiped. We 
		passed from the nave, through the sacristy to the garden beyond, where 
		we saw the thornless roses of St. Francis.<br><br>The train ride from 
		Assisi to Perugia was short and sweet, and soon we were riding up into 
		the town of Perugia, packs in place. As we turned almost the first 
		corner, down a small side street we read Alberge Diurno. We agreed on a 
		price and then settled down in our room.<br><br>Our first impression of 
		Perugia came as we walked after dinner. Everyone with his good looking 
		sister was out promenading in the town circle in their spring dresses or 
		suits. It was a sight one would imagine happening in a good-sized hill 
		town on Sunday night in the early spring. Small shops with wonderful 
		displays lined the wide main avenue, though irregularly; past the Gothic 
		town hall which looks very ostentatious in the diffused light, to the 
		main square and its fountain. A side street looked inviting, so for a 
		few minutes we wandered aimlessly through the twisting streets, at times 
		pausing a to get a more complete picture of some dimly lighted shop. In 
		one filled with huge barrels a good-natured shopkeeper was leaning on a 
		barrel jesting with a friend. We weren’t afraid of getting lost because 
		when we wished to get back, all we had to do was climb to the highest 
		point, and that is where the main street lies. Sort of like the Boy 
		Scout trick of following the stream down when lost. It is so hard to 
		believe that we are really in this hill town of Perugia. Our only wish 
		is that you, too, could be here and share this with us. So we can do is 
		our best as we write.<br><br>Back to the ridge, along the avenue, where 
		everyone is walking in the street, and weaving our way through the 
		sidewalk beer cafes and standing horse carriages, we turned down a high 
		class alley, as we might call it in America, to our comfortable humble 
		abode, for forty, make it sixty, winks..love Ted<br><br><br>May 19 
		Firenze...Tand D<br><br>From the open window here by the writing table, 
		I can look out over the tiled roofs of Firenze, alive with radio aerials 
		and chattering birds, to the green yet brown dotted hills beyond. 
		Florence enchants us with quiet quaint streets and mediaeval buildings, 
		from the moment we arrived. And this enchantment has grown as we have 
		been caught by the serenity pervading everything. Picturesque shops 
		filled with attractive handworks in metal, leather, and cloth; 
		modernistic street restaurants ; feudal strongholds; and weather-worn 
		statuary give Florence a flavor all its own-a Mecca for lovers of art 
		and history. The peacefulness hanging over everything has struck us the 
		hardest. No one seems in a hurry. Autos are scarce. Everyone smiles with 
		good humor.<br><br>Florence lives up to its name, meaning “flowers’ from 
		a Latin derivation. Firenze is Italian for Florence and is much more 
		sonorous to our ears. Bells in churches all about us are now pealing out 
		6 o’clock, in harmony. This is distinctly the Italy we have dreamed 
		about. How wonderful it would be to have you here too, if only for five 
		minutes. Just picture the streets below with Jeanette Mc Donald singing 
		and you have a fairly good idea of the atmosphere saturating us.<br><br>
		<br><br>WEDNESDAY MORNING 8:30 AM<br><br><br><br>Rain is still pouring 
		down, forcing us to stay in, and will complete some writing. We just 
		finished the week’s washing, by the way.<br><br><br><br>MAY 18 PERUGIA 
		TO FLORENCE<br><br><br><br>Up early to accomplish some back writing. How 
		it piles up these flying days. We downed our distasteful coffee-1 part 
		caffeine to 4 parts milk-helped along with some bread. Then we sat down 
		to write. The morning was quickly slipping by, so with letters half done 
		we left the auberge, armed with camera to see this quaint hill town.<br>
		<br>Perugia is one of the oldest cities in Italy, boasting a colorful 
		history going all of the way back to early Etruscan days, about 10,000 
		BC. Today traces can be seen ot this ancient flourishing civilization in 
		the stone walls and gates. Perugia was one of twelve cities comprising 
		the powerful Etruscan League. Medieval influence is seen today in the 
		impressive Gothic strongholds and churches, Roman, yet in previously 
		pagan temples and brick walls. Today Perugia's main street is lined 
		today with smart shops displaying the latest fashions in design,<br><br>
		The Museum and Cathedral, both Gothic structures-the first with an 
		especially striking facade-are the prime places of historic importance 
		and standing on the main Piazza. Its center is the celebrated statue of 
		the Panics and Cambria. Vaulted ceilings and Gothic windows interested 
		us the most, as we examined many of Peruginos most noted works. We spent 
		the rest of the morning wandering the tortuous streets. clean and bright 
		in the sunlight and alive with stimulating scenes,<br><br>Perugia is 
		some 1300 feet above the valley, and spreads out over a hill top. Its 
		streets follow the lines of least resistance along the hills contours. 
		At least every five minutes some watchful mother would sneak up behind 
		us and scream a sharp nasal ‘Maria” unhappily reminding of us of our 
		experience in the Genoa pensione. Every street is a camera study, harmed 
		only by lines of telephone wires with large insulators. On windowsills 
		cats bask and lick themselves in the sunlight. Aged faces look kindly at 
		us from second story windows, over potted plants in window boxes. Every 
		little byway goes either up or down, some ending abruptly against a 
		stone wall but always with some scene of human interest even a camera 
		can’t reveal.<br><br>Women carrying beautiful water jugs of metal and 
		pottery are at the public fountains and remind us of biblical scenes. 
		These Etruscan vases must be among the most beautiful we will ever see,<br>
		<br><br><br>THURSDAY MORNING<br><br><br><br>As we walked down one narrow 
		street the voice of Grace Moore came from an open window, and above a 
		street that could easily have been seen in her pictures. Another time, 
		several troops of soldiers marched below us singing rollicking marching 
		songs. They sounded like a college glee club. These people unleash their 
		“not so bad” voices at every opportunity, and we enjoy their enthusiasm. 
		On one corner of town we suddenly came upon a a weather beaten crumbling 
		stone church. It looked interesting, so a small bell brought the 
		attendant, who then told us of its wonders, all in Italian. Its 
		surprising the similarity between French and Italian, for we have little 
		trouble in catching the major components of these lectures.<br><br>Sante 
		Angelo, as we found the name to be, was built around a Roman temple to 
		Vesta. Holes in the ceiling to light the original columns and “blessed 
		treir” is now kept in one of the sculptured vestal lamps. Behind, 
		outside the ancient Etruscan wall we lay in the grass, just to admire 
		the the Umbrian plain and hills below us, great patchwork quilt dotted 
		with button-like orchards . To our left arises the famous “Aree di 
		Auguyste”, a Roman gate built on Etruscan foundations and topped with 
		Renascence buttresses. And climbing up our road, old Dobbin was having a 
		dickens of time pilling his heavy load of wood, with kids hanging on 
		while his driver walked beside, cracking his whip with the dexterity of 
		circus trainer.<br><br>Minerva Restaurante was the eating portion of our 
		Pensione. There we we enjoyed two delicious meals in surroundings just 
		the same today as is the time of the Knights. It is a stone cellar wish 
		narrow corridors. arched walls, and ceilings lit by rustic lamps. These 
		dark stones have seen five hundred years of service, and still look as 
		good as new. What a piece of luck to find such a place, for only a few 
		such remain today. While we waited for spaghetti, a nice looking fellow 
		came up and started speaking Italian. We must have looked completely 
		blank. All at once he popped out “Where are you from, and with 
		machinelike precision. We meekly answered, California, at which he 
		almost fell on our necks. He was from New Jersey, studying medicine in 
		Perugia. He spent the next minutes telling us more about the town.<br>
		<br>On the way down to the train after lunch, we stopped for a half hour 
		in a most beautiful spot, so common in this country. We sat on a stone 
		bench and just took it all in. Hills and valleys like our central valley 
		but with a unique springtime beauty.<br><br>Our train to Tarantella was 
		a single untie streamlined diesel powered car-now becoming popular for 
		the short tuns. At Tarantola we changed to the regular train to 
		Florence. While changing cars, we met a Mr. and Mrs. de Roover from 
		Antwerp and then we sat together to Florence. They too were “riding the 
		boards” for<br><br>third class is really fine for short distances. The 
		Mrs. is an American and seems to rule her roost. We had an interesting 
		conversation, leading to observations on the world we are seeing.<br>
		<br>Once in Florence, we recovered our bikes “out of hook”<br><br>and 
		rode, knapsacks on backs, straight to Pensione Morandi, where Miss 
		Gallagher was staying. Mrs. Morandi, is a vivacious little Irish woman. 
		Her name was McIntyre. She made us feel right at home for 20 lira, 
		including wine. She gave us a sunny third story room and filled us with 
		delicious food.<br><br>Our first impression of Florence, as we looked 
		out over its roofs and domes, was the peacefulness hanging over 
		everything, and especially when melodious church bells ring out at 6 
		o’clock-not the banging we have heard in so many other cities. And the 
		boy who waits on tables, cleans the rooms, and does everything else can 
		only be regarded as a gem. Some day we will come back perhaps loaded 
		with $10 bills for just such deserving people who work like demons and 
		expect so little in return.<br><br>After dinner we took our first walk 
		around town. The streets were almost empty save for an occasional horse 
		and carriage, or a solitary promenader It was at just such a quiet 
		corner that a car, naturally a Fiat, suddenly whizzed by from no place, 
		putting a shine on Ted’s pants. In little stands, tiny wire cages are 
		for sale, with a chirping cricket inside. This is a quaint system, we’ 
		re told, handed down from Etruscan days. Everyone buys a cricket for the 
		festive day ahead.<br><br>In the great squares, Piazza Vittoria Emanuel 
		especially, brilliantly illuminated cafes are inviting. and we stood for 
		a few minutes listening to the music, then home for a fine supper, and 
		hit the hay saturated with over indulgence of both food and beauty.<br>
		<br><br><br>MAY 29TH..AFTERNOON<br><br>These letters of mine must be 
		regarded as crossword puzzles, the way I meander without order much of 
		the time. So, let’s go again.<br><br>Museums were to be the morning’s 
		program, so we phoned Betty Lawler to meet us as soon as possible in the 
		front of Palazzo Vecchio at 2 o’clock. In characteristic feminine style, 
		she arrived at 3. The museum consumed the first hour. This great Gothic 
		fortress-palace, you name it, was the seat of Florentine power for many 
		years, when it was Duccal apartments and council halls. Of course the 
		“gimme gimme” kids are at every turn seeking to show us around. However, 
		guide books in hand, we managed to navigate successfully through the 
		rooms and great halls, all frescoed of course. Of greatest interest to 
		us was the 300 foot tower, it a tough climb but worth it to view a 
		panorama of the city. Narrow corridors took us to battlements and past 
		the small cell in which Savanarola was imprisoned before martyrdom. It 
		really wasn’t so bad after all because he had a beautiful city view from 
		his window with lots of time for thought.<br><br>The National Museum 
		situated in the Barghello palace and prison, took another hour of 
		looking. The three Della Robbias attracted us the most, for these were 
		something new and entirely different. What a treat it is to see the 
		originals of what we have in our own homes. Luga della Robia is 
		responsible for rediscovering the glass finish made by the Etruscans, 
		and his representations are both original and beautiful. Across from our 
		pensione in the Piazza Annunciata are the famous Bambinos on the portico 
		of the Foundling Home, the first such in the world. They seem as fresh 
		today, in blue and white, as fresh as they were on the day they were 
		cast. The astonishing thing is that the baking process did not injure 
		the human features. Giovanni and Andrea, both della Robias, were equally 
		skillful. John of Bologna’s “Mercury” and Michelangelo’s “Mark” were 
		treats to see, along with some of Cellini’s works in the much pictured 
		staircase leading up to the the Barthello’s courtyard.<br><br>We wished 
		to look at silver and leather goods for which Florence is also famous . 
		At 5:30 we met Miss Gallagher who knows all of the best shops. The 
		silver work is beautiful as well, formed in the ancient style and sold 
		by weight. However, much of it is trash, and is sold to tourists on the 
		Ponte Vecchio, so well known “the bridge of the jewelers”. Gorgeous 
		stones add much to the beauty of their Etruscan settings. Italian 
		shopkeepers are quite different from American, and in a big way. If you 
		come in they take it for granted you will buy, and they become very 
		disagreeable if you don’t make a purchase. Americans are gradually 
		learning to buy only when something suits them.<br><br>The leather shops 
		were the most fascinating to us. But here again one has to be careful 
		for only a few stores are responsible enough for one to be sure of the 
		quality. We have found, as Dad has always said, that nothing is cheap 
		that is good. 8 Lira purses don’t interest us for the leather is thin 
		and will wear out rapidly. We were taken to a top shop on the Arno where 
		we watched skilled craftsmen at work. The $10 we spent there will bring 
		much satisfaction, an opportunity we would have been foolish to have 
		passed up.<br><br>As we walked back to the pension the pleasant strains 
		of “Sweet Mystery of Life” came to us from a theater playing “Naughty 
		Marietta” at 1.50 lira a seat. The temptation was too much, so we made 
		plans with Betty to meet her for the nine o’clock show. When we arrived 
		on time her taxi was standing in front while she stood fumbling for some 
		coins. We bailed her out with our largesse. She found out later that the 
		taxi driver had taken advantage of her ignorance of Italian and city 
		streets and had driven round and round the block, not heeding her cries. 
		And he got his money!<br><br>The picture was really enjoyable as it 
		always will be with such beautiful music. The actors were apparently 
		speaking in French, with Italian words dubbed in, except for the songs 
		themselves. We thoroughly enjoyed it as much as the locals. The gallery 
		is the choice play to sit in Italy, and the crowd acts like a bunch of 
		college kids, stamping and whistling when the picture flickers.<br><br>
		<br><br>FRIDAY MORNING<br><br>Tomorrow we go to Venice for one day, then 
		to Verona and Milan. We are planning to leave Italy on Wednesday. Brig 
		will be our first Swiss stop. Then we go to Zermatt, out of the way, but 
		with its Matterhorrn. We should be in Munich about the 16th of June. 
		This is our last day in Florence so must be off. Dick<br><br><br>May 20 
		Firenze..Ted<br><br><br><br>Its raining again. Such luck. But yesterday 
		was nice and Florence looked good, for the moment. There are three 
		characteristics that define this city-the leather shops, silver and gold 
		workers, and finally linens. Then come the flower shops overflowing and 
		with the scents of roses as the name Florence or Firenza says. And third 
		is the ringing of church bells throughout the day. You might add the 
		hose drawn carriages which roam the streets just as they have for 
		centuries, and finally the cleanliness and honesty of the people which 
		seems to be the rule In all ways. it is a lovely city to our eyes.<br>
		<br>Yesterday we were occupied by a combination of business and 
		window-shopping. Some of the shops are super, with things we can just 
		admire. The famous Ponte Vecchio is lined with goldsmiths who make 
		enticing window displays while others resemble pawn shops, yet without 
		the three balls out front, actually the coat of arms of the Medicis, I 
		believe. Their origin goes something like this. It seems that the Medici 
		family were formally doctors and on the famous shield they placed the 
		symbols of three pills. When they advanced in wealth to the level of 
		bankers, they kept their moniker in the same form of the three balls.<br>
		<br>In the American Express yesterday we were waiting at the counter 
		thinking of not having met a Californian since leaving the orient when a 
		pretty girl stepped up and asked when there would be a ship leaving an 
		Italian port for San Francisco. It took a few moments for us to say 
		hello. She is Betty Tower. She is a graduate of Castalejo in my year, 
		having lived in Palo Alto. She and her mother, who has been very ill 
		thus necessitating the early trip home. have been traveling by car 
		through Europe. She is going to Stanford in September. We talked for a 
		while comparing notes on friends and later in the day went to the Uffizi 
		Gallery together, along with our fine Scotch friend from Rome who added 
		a great deal to the visit with his knowledge of art. But we also had to 
		rehear his worn out jokes as he fingered his goatee with that look of 
		wisdom. Our new friend going to Stanford proved to b a good sport and we 
		hope we will have more of her company.<br><br>Last evening we ran into 
		Mr. Falletti, our acquaintance from the Vatican when we saw the Pope. He 
		heads for Venice in the morning, in true American style, not missing out 
		on anything. There go the church bells a again. What a warm atmosphere 
		they create.<br><br>We can hardly wait to reach Venice, having 
		transferred our letters from you from Geneva. Ted ..<br><br><br>May 21 
		Florence Ted <br><br><br><br>Yesterday we visited the Pitti Gallery with 
		our Scotch friend. We know so little about the stories and subjects 
		portrayed in the art collections that without a guide of some sort, we 
		lose a good deal. We enjoyed the Pitti more than the Uffizi because the 
		figures seem more natural and thus real. I enjoyed particularly the 
		collection of Cellini goblets. They had fascinated me in my high school 
		history class for Benvenuto Cellini seemed to have such an imaginative 
		high class rake. Did I imagine a personal resemblance?<br><br>This 
		morning Miss Gallagher guided us through the Church of Santa Croce, the 
		Westminister Abbey of Florence where famous sons of Florence are buried 
		or commemorated. In one instance we were shown the difference between 
		the earlier and later workmanship of Michelangelo who is buried in the 
		church, and such men as Raphael, Dante, and Masiniare are revered on 
		plaques scattered around. Frescoes by Giotto and terracottas by Andrea 
		della Robia are there as well. The organ, the finest in italy, was given 
		by our own Bank of Italy founder, Giannini. Some of the sculptures are 
		exquisite. Even a minor artist’s work seems remarkable and makes one 
		aware of this sea of talent in Florence. And for us it is quite 
		wonderful that we can absorb enough to take home with us and color our 
		future intellectual lives, perhaps.<br><br>This morning we examined the 
		bronze “Doors,of Paradise” which Michelangelo so praised. They are the 
		work of Gibretti and open into the Baptistry opposite the Cathederal. 
		The scenes in bronze, tinged with green oxidation of age, are biblical. 
		Ii don’t think we will ever think of Florence without bringing these 
		doors to mind.<br><br>We just had another cloudburst. We are so hardened 
		to rain that is just a comma in our day. We are fondest of the 
		leather-work here, and you would be too. Oh for a trunk to bring some 
		home except for one missing item-money.<br><br>The afternoon was dreary 
		with rain. Luckily we were in a church when the biggest cloudburst hit. 
		Even the church roof started to leak enough to shower a tomb or two. 
		With this wetness all of our plans for an afternoon out side dissolved 
		so we instead continued tramps through churches, all loaded with 
		frescoes of note. Mr. Air, from Rome, was our companion. It seems he is 
		taking notes from ancient manuscripts on information about certain 
		comedies written by someone in two hundred years BC. Since every hundred 
		years or so the manuscripts have been copied the interpretations varying 
		as one desires, his job is to get it right.<br><br>Tonight was opera 
		night. We entered through a back stairway leading to the balcony, one of 
		six above one another and in a V facing the stage. When we took our 
		seats on the wooden bench in a box on the top tier we had a chance to 
		observe the music and drama lovers below who were reading newspapers or 
		just talking. These are the plutocrats who were enjoying, I hope, their 
		red plush seats. Full evening dress was lacking but rabbit and rat furs 
		were abundant. While the orchestra tuned up and the ventilators buzzed, 
		chauffeurs, soldiers, young and old couples of small means, as well as 
		whole families, flocked to the benches we were enjoying. At 9:15 the 
		curtain bearing the Florentine Lilly parted and the entertainment began. 
		The opera was Maristella by Salvani. We knew nothing of it or the 
		composer, and we are still hazy about its particulars. The orchestra was 
		top notch as were the singers. After each outstanding solo, the audience 
		would clap enthusiastically, calling for more until satisfied. And after 
		each of the three acts, again prolonged clapping was the rule. It was 
		one evening of fun for us, and all for the colossal sum of 49 of our 
		lira, or thirty cents. That’s getting your moneys’ worth! Good night Ted<br>
		<br><br>May 23 Florence-Venice Dick<br><br><br><br>Dear All<br><br>The 
		rain is becoming tiresome. Nineteen days out of 38 so far, and in 13 out 
		of 15 cities visited-some record for the Riviera, and sunny southern 
		Italy and in the springtime. But you have been having rain too. I am 
		trying to write as we ride from Florence to Venice. We have just passed 
		through Ferrara, Colonel Cottica’s home town. The sun is trying to come 
		out. Hope it does for our few days in Venice. I give up-the train 
		bounces too much for me to write a reasonable hand.<br><br>5 PM <br><br>
		I am continuing in our Smith pensione room in Venice just off the famous 
		San Marco Square. We are right behind the well known clock which is now 
		striking. The narrow streets are filled with gossiping people, their 
		voices sounding like the murmurs of a mountain stream. We must get down 
		to business. We were two anxious boys when we asked at America Express 
		for letters forwarded from Geneva. Just think, this is our first mail 
		since April 12th, more than a month back. It was with excited nervous 
		fingers we read and reread each of the pile. Letters also from Wins, 
		Sally Ammen, Ralph Kingsbury, Uncle Tom, Major Overton, and Fong Sec 
		were happily received. Thank you for the clippings and photos. Bruce, 
		thank you for your swell letter. Guess you have broken all the records 
		in ‘C’ track by now, and won the Patrol contest in family style. The 
		check was received safely and with many thanks. We will turn it into a 
		Letter of Credit in Geneva, traveler’s cheques being too much of a 
		bother. They are just about the same as carrying $10 bills. We were very 
		interested in Kiplinger’s commentaries on Italy’s financial standing. 
		How they have carried on a remarkable building program and still 
		financed a war is beyond us. Please wish Wins a belated Happy Birthday 
		for us. Major Overton’s letter is tremendously interesting and helpful. 
		I would like to have been there to sponsor Wins. I know that our letters 
		from Europe will not be as interesting as those from the orient, and for 
		several reasons. Time is so short and we cannot go into details about 
		things more commonplace and we’re not using Rotary contacts often. The 
		glamour and mystery also is less, perhaps and even boring at times, as 
		we simply write the chronicle of our activities. That is too bad about 
		the missing Philippine letter or letters. If they haven’t arrived by now 
		they are surely lost. Here are some bare facts.<br><br>I think you know 
		about our stay in Manila, the Rotary meeting, the kindness of Judge 
		Lockwood, and our dinner with Judge and Mrs. Ingersoll and Mr. Miller. 
		Judge Lockwood told us that Mrs. Ammen had written to him to be sure we 
		stay at Baguio Country Club as her guests. There we enjoyed luxurious 
		comfort and wonderful food while taking in the beauty, with marvelous 
		weather. We were able to observe the native Igorotes, so much more 
		civilized than reported. A Mrs. Quigley whom we happened to meet at an a 
		army reservation took us around by car. The cool monition air is the 
		cardinal virtue of Baguio, and makes it the prime upscale resort for 
		Manila. We stayed there one night, played 9 holes of golf the next 
		morning, coming in 3 over par, much to the surprise of Mr. Fisher the 
		likable manager. The train and bus trip to and from Baguio was a real 
		experience, giving us our closest view into the people’s lives and 
		habits. We greatly appreciate Mrs. Ammen’s thoughtfulness, adding so 
		much to our stay. The boat trip down the rapids of Pagsenhan was 
		thrilling, all made possible by Judge Lockwood who gave us his car for 
		the day. He is special, and dinner in his home the night before we left 
		was a treat. These are just a few brief thoughts for those were eventful 
		days still fresh in our minds.<br><br><br><br>May 22<br><br><br><br>
		Great plans were made for this last day in Florence, but it poured puppy 
		dogs off and on all day so that we spent most of the time running for 
		protection beneath eaves over walks. A bike trip to Fissile and the 
		countryside was the program before the skies opened up again, so we 
		stayed in town, did a little business, and enjoyed the sights. It is a 
		great stunt here to have a street artist paint one’s face into a 
		religious triptych and thus play “Saint”. Since we aren’t and are really 
		cheap, we remain just ordinary guys.<br><br>Whether the Medicis lived up 
		to their reputations as wise men is hard to say. Perhaps things don’t 
		change from the days of Savanarola. In fact we are now afraid to express 
		any views on a political situation, for whlle in a country we receive 
		only one side of a problem, and very well presented, and then in the 
		next country the opinions are reversed. Major Overton made a statement 
		that could not be more true, to the effect that we will never be able to 
		hate a people, for as we travel we learn to love each country and feel 
		that each must have good reasons for it actions.<br><br>The Iaccardi 
		Medici Palace has a colorful history, remnants we see in their coats of 
		arms, beautiful frescoes, giant mirrors. and spacious rooms and 
		courtyards filled with Roman antiquities. Today it is the Prefecture, as 
		are many of the great palaces of the past. The tombs of the Medicis are 
		among those certain few things no visitor to Florence misses, for here, 
		lying in grandeur is the family that did so much to forward and preserve 
		the art that we see today. Michelangelo lived in the house of the Medici 
		for years, paying nothing as he worked at creating. Any other fine 
		artist was given the same benefits, so that he might work unhindered. 
		The Medicis made Florence what it is today, the art center of the world. 
		Was this farsightedness or just luck? Capella de Medici or Chapel of the 
		Princes was originally planned to enshrine the Holy Sepluchre to be 
		acquired somehow, but the scheme failed. Instead it became the burial 
		sites for the Dukes. In its original form the walls and floor were 
		entirely covered with precious marbles and frescoes. Some of the workmen 
		today are busy repairing the floors. We watched them with such care fit 
		in each piece of inlay. The New Sacristy, built by Michelangelo for the 
		older members of the family, lies down the corridor a few steps away, 
		constructed in a simple Renascence style. Four of his greatest works 
		Night, Day, Dawn, and Twilight, remain unfinished as is the case with 
		many of his pieces .<br><br><br><br>AHEAD TO VENICE<br><br><br><br>The 
		clock has just struck 9 o’clock as we hear the voices of men singing, 
		and their marching feet in the square here in Venice. They harmonize 
		beautifully and sounds are clear and strong. A band just went by. We 
		will have to hurry to see what gives.<br><br><br><br>6:30 PM. Back again 
		TO FLORENCE and at it again after a full day in Venice.<br><br>
		Michelangelo’s David preserved in the Bella Arte or Academy of Fine Arts 
		was our excuse for the visit to that remarkable place. Plaster casts of 
		other Michelangelo sculptures, most unfinished, were equally arresting 
		but not as intriguing as the originals in Rome. The works of Fra 
		Angelico drew us to San Marco Museum, once the monastery in which the 
		great Dominican Savanarola, Fra Angelica, and Fra Bartolomeo studied and 
		lived. The ceilings were especially interesting, decorated with 
		paintings by Fra Angelico, but the library took the prize for us. There 
		we were able to inspect marvelous manuscripts printed so carefully by 
		hand and illustrated with delicate plates in color. Each is bound with 
		heavy leather and clasps.<br><br>A run between protective overhangs 
		landed us back at the Morandi for another delicious lunch helped with a 
		wine-free concoction still unnamed. A most unexciting afternoon followed 
		due to the disagreeable threatening clouds. Business with CIT, American 
		Express, the leather shop where we watched the goodies in the making, 
		gave us a few ideas for our leather work at home, and writing letters 
		took a great deal of time. There was one noted church we had not seen, 
		so about five thirty, when things looked brighter, we rode our bikes at 
		top speed up winding Via Michelangelo to the Piazza of the same name, 
		noted for its view of the city and surrounding valley, with the River 
		Arno now dirty with topsoil from the rains flowing below. A few minutes 
		of looking were enough, for something awfully black was above and we 
		felt those first telltale drops. Above the Piazza, some hundred yards 
		back, stands the Church of San Mineta, with facade of colored marbles, 
		its inlaid marble floors, ceiling of wood supported by timber rafters, 
		and some beautiful works of della Robbia-always a fascination to us. Of 
		all the churches in Florence, San Mineto endeared itself most to us, for 
		its simplicity was in keeping with the sincerity it exudes, Rain again 
		sheeted down as we admired the glossy white and blue della Robias, their 
		wreaths of fruit bringing to mind his works in our home, particularly at 
		Christmas, Mom<br><br>Luck stayed with us on the ride back, so that we 
		were dry for dinner. An after dinner discussion with Mr. Press, a 
		Latvian student studying medicine in Florence, brought out some 
		revealing facts about the Italian universities. The attitudes of the 
		students are really in the childish stages that our institutions have 
		long ago passed through with respect to hazing. The hazing is so bad 
		here that only a few freshmen are able to make attend the classes late 
		in the year. It even goes so far as to make the freshmen pay exorbitant 
		taxes, which the upper classmen pocket. Of course it is just plain 
		robbery and this sort of thing will go on indefinitely, for the new 
		students are too scared to stand up for their rights, especially as they 
		plot what they will do to the next freshman class. Lovely playmates! One 
		big happy family? It isn’t what it seems. love dick.<br><br><br>May 26 
		Iselle<br><br>This is the third time that I have started this letter, 
		and in three different places: Venice, Milan, and now Iselle, a tiny 
		border hamlet nestled in an Alpine stream valley on the Italian 
		frontier. The sun has passed below jagged snow capped peaks to the west, 
		as we sit on our alberghe porch above a churning roaring stream which 
		though the centuries has cut its way down, leaving precipitous cliffs 
		verdant with ferns and other rugged plants. Tiny waterfalls spring 
		through invisible cracks, ever refreshed by the melting snow. 
		Weather-worn tumbledown rail fences and rock walls surround the quaint 
		village houses across from us, roofed with roughly hewn slate and 
		repaired in splotches with the same material. All is green about, with 
		the reds, whites, blues, and yellows of Johnny Jump-ups, Snapdragons, 
		Buttercups and Forget-me-nots. It’s just like home Away up and built on 
		the edge of nothing are a few simple dwellings, reached by steep narrow 
		paths along the cliff’s edge and through clusters of flowering white 
		lilac trees and a few shivering alders. How we wish you could be here to 
		take this all in. The roaring of the stream would put an end to all 
		worries as you just sit, breath the fresh alpine air and enjoy the 
		unsurpassed beauty and restfulness all about us. But must get down to 
		business.<br><br><br><br>Our days in Venice, the city with a hairnet of 
		water.<br><br><br><br>May 24. VENICE<br><br><br><br>We must have 
		overslept for we were awakened by the rollicking songs of young voices 
		and tramping of feet in unison, all coming from our open sunlit window. 
		From the excitement going on outside, we gathered that today would be a 
		big day in Venice. Pensione Smith, our abode, is situated right behind 
		the famous clock of San Marco overlooking the even better known Plazza 
		San Marco, fronted with the ornate Cathedral, and to its left the Duccal 
		Palace. A very little writing was done before swallowing an appetizing 
		breakfast and hurrying into the square below. And what a sight met our 
		eyes! Marching soldiers and uniformed youths coming from every direction 
		as they converged in the center to quickly fill up the Plazza. Bands 
		were playing stirring music and adding to the excitement, obvious to 
		bystanders as they strained to see the show.<br><br>In order to get an 
		unobstructed view, we paid two lira and climbed up to the notorious 
		balcony of the Church from which Doges watched glorious spectacles, now 
		only observed by the four immense bronze horses, green with weathering. 
		Our view was excellent and we had time to glean information about the 
		event while waiting for something to happen.<br><br>This day, the 24th 
		day in May, is the anniversary of Italy’s entrance into the war against 
		Austria. We in America have holidays to at the end such a conflict! It 
		is a Fascisti holiday when members of various groups graduate to a 
		higher level. Here is a rough sketch of the party organization, 
		beginning with the Young Fascisti, everything going up from there on. 
		From the age of 4 to 7, the boy is a member of the “Figli della Lupa” or 
		“Sons of the Lupa”. At seven he becomes a “Balilla” and wears Alpine 
		green; at 14 an “Avabguardisti” with a black uniform and red and yellow 
		neckerchief; at 18 a “:Giovanni Fascisti” or Young Fascisti wearing a 
		simple black shirt. At 21, he is a member of the “Partite”(Party) and 
		wears natty black from head to toe. Each of these groups are trained in 
		military fashion, starting young with sticks for guns. Later on they 
		wear knives on their belts, but the knives are made of rubber, not steel 
		! Even the girls in white and black regulation dresses comprise an 
		important part of the system. Enthusiasm oozes from every level as Young 
		italy trains under Il Duce’s hand. Gorgeously uniformed officers with 
		acres of gold braid conducted the proceedings from a central platform, 
		their proclamations answered with sharp cheers and Fascisti salutes in 
		unison. Pigeons roosted in eaves, their stomping ground not available at 
		the moment.<br><br>tt was during the ceremonies that we ran into Ben 
		Noble, an interesting fellow who had just returned from India as a 
		correspondent for the New York Post. His flat hat, high water boots and 
		zippy monologue gave us the idea of how a reporter should look-the Lee 
		Tracy type. He had never heard of California and we countered that we 
		were glad to learn that there is a Connecticut. So we were even and got 
		along fine, trading travel stories. He got the better of us when it came 
		to excitement, when he told us of experiences along with his 
		observations on Gandhi and British problems in India.<br><br>At the end 
		of the ceremonies, rolling drums and bands started to march again as the 
		square emptied. After many minutes, all that was left were three great 
		flags drooping lazily in the mild breezes-two Italian and one bearing 
		the Lion of St. Mark.<br><br>The sky was clear and the sun bright, but 
		clouds threatened to the east, warning of rain and the need to get our 
		photos promptly. For two hours we wandered the maze of streets and 
		byways, trying to get a taste of the city as it was and still is. Houses 
		are densely packed together, running right into the water, shutting out 
		healthful sunlight during the greater part of the day. Graceful black 
		gondolas ply the narrow waterways, propelled by the single long oar in 
		the gondoliers’ supple hands, and so effortlessly. Fancy moldings and 
		shinny metal fixtures are the marks of the finest gondolas. Blunt-nosed 
		commercial barges add to the picturesqueness of the waterways, often 
		lying in the shadows where one cannot see the ever present floating 
		debris.<br><br>Our maps are almost of no use to us for they cannot 
		possibly show all the tiny passages and byways. Time and again our 
		street ended at the water, for bridges come at irregular intervals and 
		seem haphazardly placed. We literally followed our noses, and they are 
		fine guides especially as they pick up the disagreeable odors.<br><br>
		Hoping to receive a real touch of the “old”, odors and all, we worked 
		our way to the Ghetto where Shylock must have lived, leaving it only to 
		ply his trade on the Rialto Bridge with its lining of shops. However, 
		the Ghetto presented almost the same appearance as the rest of Venice, 
		save for a few venerable shawl-covered heads looking from curtained 
		windows, as they watch with expressionless eyes the passing parade. 
		Circular sculptured massive bronze wells in courtyard centers were a 
		surprise. A few beggars and many children completed the Ghetto scene, 
		especially for our camera.<br><br>Returning to our Pensione for lunch, 
		we were quickly again engulfed in the tide of humanity decked out in 
		summer clothing, promenading along Venice’s prime shop street, the 
		Merceria. Here on Sunday inhabitants sip wine in the Square, rather than 
		troop around 18 holes as do we, chasing an overgrown marble. San Marco 
		Plazza is packed all day with smartly dressed attractive women and 
		escorts, not going any place, but just enjoying the sunshine, pigeons, 
		and themselves.<br><br>Venice has three churches which should not be 
		missed. They are San Marco, Church of the Frasi, and S.S. Giovanni e 
		Paulo(John and Paul). In order to do the city justice we spent an hour 
		or so after lunch tramping to their locations in three different parts 
		of the city. Our feet received a good workout today. The Frari and John 
		and Paul were constructed similarly, both impressively high with severe 
		apses in classic Gothic. As we travel further north we find the Gothic 
		influence in architecture growing stronger, and likewise find ourselves 
		appreciating its royal dignity more and more.<br><br>Tombs of the Doges 
		fill S.S. Giovanni e Paule, placed haphazardly along the walls. As we 
		admired the noble angular apse, children’s voices rang through the 
		church as they shouted responses in front of a side chapel And another 
		large Titian added its elegance.<br><br>However, a Madonna and Child by 
		Bellini, considered to be the finest of his works, held us enraptured, 
		facial features were so real. We believe we are slowly learning to 
		appreciate fine art here in Italy this last month, surely adding 
		something to future enjoyment whenever exposed to art treasures.<br><br>
		(Time out to cross the Simplon Pass into Switzerland. We are in the tiny 
		town of Visp just a few kilometers from Brig where we tale the path up 
		to Zermatt and the Matterhorn It is difficult to go back to Venice after 
		the wonders of this day’s ride, coupled with receiving first impressions 
		of Switzerland.<br><br><br><br>Plaza San Marco is the central point of 
		Venetian life. just as it has been for centuries. Everyone either starts 
		at or ends up in it as one walks about the city where one must walk to 
		see. The Campanile, situated in the eastern corner of the square at the 
		edge of the Grand Canal, is important for its views. Just as we started 
		to enter (1 lira each) a red headed boy stepped up and asked if we were 
		the Lyons. He then introduced himself as Pat Crowe from New York, saying 
		that he had been directed by Miss Gallagher in Florence to keep an eye 
		out for a red and a blue sweater, draped on a couple of flag poles. We 
		quickly took him in tow to the top of the Campanile, climbing the 
		circular ramp, while the well-to -do rode up in the lift, probably an 
		Otis. Pat proved to be one of the most unusual &quot;cases&quot;.” we have met. He 
		travels alone, not seeing anything-he spent one night in Florence-and 
		having only a vague future in mind. Ireland seems to be his eventual 
		destination, but in the meantime he is wasting money, spending it right 
		and left and for the wrong reasons. He has never heard of a Letter of 
		Credit nor “tourist liras”: knows not a word of italian: buys “through” 
		RR tickets on night trains: and doesn’t know what he has seen. I am 
		writing this down because such is the case with many tourists.<br><br>
		The panorama from the Camponile gave us a fairly good idea as to how the 
		city is laid out. Save the Grand Canal, not another waterway can be seen 
		as closely packed buildings overhang the small canals. Not until we ran 
		down the ramp to the Plazza did we realize the height we had just 
		climbed to.<br><br>The afternoon was still young, so how about a trip to 
		the Lido? We had just missed the boat in true Lyon style, but managed to 
		catch the next water-taxi-bus, or Vaporetto, with time to spare. The 
		Lido lies on a long narrow island resembling an off shore bar, some few 
		miles from Venice proper and the grand Canal. Just a few words about 
		this renowned bathing and pleasure resort.<br><br>The broad sandy beach, 
		several kilometers long, is now taken up by an unbroken line of beach 
		clubs, for the most part private. Tiny bathhouses stand neatly in rows- 
		thousands of them- and well back from the water’s edge. These one-person 
		dressing rooms must be the Cabanas of Italy. The day was sunny but cool 
		breezes kept all, save a few hardies, from donning bathing suits. The 
		Ice cream vendors pushing merry little boat-shaped carts do a rushing 
		business midst the holiday crowd, The Lido looked to us like an ideal 
		summer resort, nearby but away from the bustle of business life. It was 
		truly peaceful.<br><br>Returning on the launch we had plenty of time to 
		speculate on such matters as gondolas and gondoliers These gondolas are 
		racy-looking crafts, with slick hulls and glistening black decks. The 
		gondoliers, often one forward and always one standing high on the stern, 
		propel their boats at great speed. Their movements are graceful and 
		easy, handling their oars to attain the most power with the least 
		effort, as they guide more than propel. Their manner of rowing is so 
		finished and easy that I suggest we try it in America. Am having a dozen 
		gondolas shipped C.O.D.<br><br>While in Florence, Miss Gallagher had 
		made a date with us to meet ‘neath the Great Clock at 8: 30 in the 
		evening, and sure enough there she was. Of course we ran again into Mr. 
		Paletti-we do not know which of us is shadowing the other. Of course he 
		joined our “neath the clock group”, as the membership increased to five 
		when Pat Crowe appeared. What an unusual bunch! Sort of a gathering of 
		the nuts from four states in the Union. As accepted, Miss Gallagher ran 
		the show, but Paletti managed to to get in a few words of Chicago lingo 
		between breaths. Pat’s philosophies of life went unheard in the over 
		bearing competition. For almost two hours we cluttered up the Plazza, 
		joking and slinging. before finally being reminded of the late hour as 
		Big Ben above sounded off. Sleepy goodbyes and best wishes for pleasant 
		trips closed the club’s fast and final session.<br><br>It is a fact but 
		the chances of our never seeing these three friends again are great, and 
		yet what effects each of us might have had on each other is 
		unfortellable. During our trip we have said aloha to many such friends, 
		also never to see again, and yet these memories will always be cherished 
		and in place long after museums and palaces are forgotten.<br><br>Just a 
		few side comments on our affairs in Europe,. Will you please speak to 
		our Congressman and tell him to put the USA back on the gold standard.? 
		Living is too blamed expensive over here. In fact the dollar is so cheap 
		that they’re melting them to make manhole covers, I am told. Things are 
		costing about one half again more than we counted on with the 59 cent 
		dollar.<br><br>2. The Shellams will possibly go through San Franciso in 
		August. They will be in a rush so may not be able to see you. When we 
		all go to China he will take us for a locomotIve ride from Tientsin to 
		Peking.<br><br>3. Plans now are,roughly Zermatt tomorrow, Montreaux the 
		next day, then Geneva. But nothing can be definite. We will spend twelve 
		to fourteen days in Switzerland. It is truly God’s country, oh so 
		beautiful.<br><br>4. For letters-Munich June 16 and then Berlin If we 
		don’t get the letters hopefully we can have them forwarded. American 
		Express is something special. We will try to see Bill Lang and John 
		Lyman in Heidelberg. More writing yet to do on this our first day in 
		Switzerland, as we play catch up again.<br><br>PS These letters are 
		hurried and mistakes require corrections. Thanks for so doing.<br><br>
		<br><br>May 26 Milano Ted<br><br>Oddly enough I am writing in one the 
		new electric trains in 3rd class while waiting for our time of departure 
		to Dormodossola. This morning we left the Verona station at 7 o’clock 
		and tremendously enjoyed the 2 /2 hour ride to Milan. People in the 
		fields were cutting hay and orchards of cherry trees filled the 
		landscape. To the north in the far distance tower the snow capped Alps 
		and where mountains met the plain their are small villages with their 
		single church steeples. When we reached Milan we left the train in the 
		colossal new station and took a tram to the center of town. Milan is 
		said to be larger than Rome. It was lucky that we took the tram for we 
		had just enough time to finish up business. Next came the Cathedral, the 
		third largest in Europe after St. Peters and Seville. The exterior is 
		covered with the usual pinnacles, statues, and gargoyles, providing an 
		odd yet pleasing effect. We entered from the front and found ourselves 
		looking down the main nave of five such. The ceiling is supported by 
		fifty-two columns that measure forty-five feet in circumference. Our 
		curiosity got the best of us as we remembered Dad’s story about the 
		chimes, so we found where the man went down to ring them with 
		electricity. It is true that it is done this way, but our stay was too 
		short to allow us to hear the ringing.<br><br>Yesterday morning we arose 
		in Venice early with a big day ahead. First we hired a gondola not only 
		for the fun and experience, but to take us to the building housing 
		Salviatti glass and mosaic works. Our boatman standing behind us in his 
		dungaree attire, propelled us steadily to our destination on the Grand 
		Canal The gondola is jet black except for our seats lying low in the 
		craft. What a great trip! We landed, paid the small fee, and were 
		ushered into a shop that contains the most varied glassware we have ever 
		seen. Our main reason for this jaunt was the fact that this is where the 
		Stanford Chapel mosaics were created. We discussed this with the 
		proprietor and then went in the back room, to watch the blowers at work. 
		We seated ourselves opposite to fiery burners which contain the opaque 
		molten glass, with transparent molten glass blown at the other end of 
		the room. It reminded us of the same display at the San Diego 
		Exposition, but this was for real by workers brought into the trade from 
		childhood. Speedily and with precision and repetition, they molded the 
		glass as it cooled. At first we thought the object would be a light 
		globe, but to our surprise it evolved into a green swan, and it is done 
		with such ease. We thanked them as the swan set went to the cool room to 
		harden. And then when a we asked to see the manufacture of mosaics as 
		was done for Stanford, we learned that that workman was in Milan for a 
		show. <br><br>Then It was time to move on and get ready to leave for 
		Verona. After thanking our host we walked through the irregular byways 
		and over countless bridges, including the splendid high and arched 
		Acadamia to Piazza San Marco.<br><br>The finest Gothic edifice in Venice 
		is the Doge’s Palace- so off to see it. We had to go up three flights of 
		stairs from the main courtyard to the galleries of venetian art. Know to 
		everyone as the rooms of the Council of Three, and The Council of Ten, 
		the large hall contains the immense painting said to the largest is the 
		world by Tintoretto, ”Paradise”. Around the room were the portraits of 
		76 Doges, and the black painted drape on one and said to be a warning to 
		traitors. There of course were the usual stories about each room 
		culminating in the fabled Bridge of Sighs. Cells like those of Chateau 
		d’If and Castle St. Angelo in Rome were dark and forbidding. As we 
		crossed one threshold Dick put one hand on my shoulder, the other 
		clasping my wrists behind me and we walked with direful steps into the 
		gloom of the dungeons. It might have been effective but somehow we just 
		couldn’t get into the necessary mood. So after a short scuffle, we 
		emerged again into the welcome sunlight. When we finally left we could 
		picture more clearly what really happened in the Duccal Palace when 
		Venice was at the top of the seafaring world.<br><br>After lunch of 
		spaghetti and wine, we took a last look at the square, the pigeons, the 
		Cathedral and the Palace, and boarded the Vaporetto-the canal bus-for 
		the station. We were sorry to see the Lido disappear, then the Rialto 
		come and go as we passed under it, but we hope to return someday. Our 
		train took us away from the islands on a long low trestle with water on 
		all sides. Soon were moving across the Lombardy plain with its rich 
		green perspective all about mirroring the fertility of the soil. Fields 
		of grain squared off with single rows of vine-draped fruit trees and 
		every few miles we would slip through a small town of whitewashed houses 
		with the inevitable church spire. Within two hours Verona announced 
		itself and we were soon hiking to town, first to find a room and then to 
		see what we could see. The first hotel we found proved adequate, so 
		knapsacks were left and we started out.<br><br>Verona was already an 
		ancient city when it came under the control of Rome and she still 
		proudly guards a few reminders of this past. The most impressive remains 
		are those of the amphitheater where Operas are now presented in July and 
		August. Another Roman Amphitheater. an arch, several gates, and a 
		medieval bridge are scattered among the new construction that is modern 
		Italy. The Senliger family seems to have been the great patrons of 
		Verona, for there is a monument to the family in the form of a plaza, 
		with Dante’s statue in its center. It was this family that welcomed the 
		poet when he fled from Florence. Veronese are noted for their genius in 
		construction and an example is the well preserved Castel Vecchio, once 
		the main castle. We photoed the striking long graceful low bridge 
		spanning the River Adige. Not to compare with Genoa, but demanding 
		respect, are the old palaces with their still frescoed and ornamental 
		facades. The Church of San Zeno, a romanesque basilica with magnificent 
		bronze doors and cloisters, was are only religious pilgrimage here. 
		After a climb up<br><br>a hill behind the city for a view of the 
		outlying country, we returned to the center of the own and the Plaza 
		Erbe. We rounded a corner to find a rather unusual scene. The plaza of 
		irregular shape is surrounded by many large and fanciful buildings, with 
		extensive frescoing and ornamentation standing out in the bright 
		sunlight. Above were squads of sparrows, darting and spinning over the 
		roof tops, and below, was the market consisting of flimsy booths 
		protected with umbrellas. Like an American drugstore, everything could 
		be found. Soldiers in groups a were loitering to talk or enjoying 
		water-ice. Water-ice is interesting. One clever maid scraped ice from a 
		big cake, while her robust partner inverted it into a tall thin glass 
		and proceeded unerringly to pour in a variety of colored juices. It 
		reminded us of a dye or just ink and the boys loved it. Postcards, lace, 
		vegetables, shoes, fruit and fountain pens could be had for a song. 
		Cafes spread out into the plaza and as shadows lengthened looked 
		inviting. Dick and his little brother Ted sat down in a nice looking one 
		and enjoyed a real Veronese dinner. I wish you could have been with us 
		later in our small verandah among potted plants and my feet on the 
		railing, crooning to a new moon, and competing with the noise from 
		below. Well, again, it was just as well you didn’t have to hear it. Ted<br>
		<br><br><br><br>16...June 17 Munich<br><br>We found the Rotary secretary 
		in one of the large hotels. She greeted us warmly and said she had been 
		expecting us since May 20. Yesterday was a most interesting day. Arising 
		in Munchen from our camp beds at 6:30AM when the bell sounded, we 
		climbed out of our clolh bags(schlaf sacs) and dressed in our Sunday 
		best in preparation for presentation at the Rotary office. Slippage next 
		to me was a boy from a city in northern Germany who had met a Stanford 
		student a while back. He was delighted to discover someone from the same 
		place. He speaks English well so from him we got the dope on how to make 
		things work right.<br><br>For breakfast we must buy a slip at the office 
		and present it to the pantry downstairs, where they will fill out the 
		order for milk, rolls, and jam. We aren’t allowed to leave our baggage 
		in the sleeping room, so during the day it rests in a locker. After 
		breakfast we wrote a bit and then rode into town to American Express to 
		buy a Grisbon’s guide book for Munich and the royal castles of Bavaria. 
		We found the Rotary secretary in one of the large hotels. She said she 
		had been expecting us since May 20. Better late than never.<br><br>We 
		learned that the meeting was to be held at noon, so after a cordial 
		invitation by the secretary we had our hair cut and shoes shined. At 
		1:30 we returned from a walk about the streets and entered a room filled 
		with fine looking men talking in groups. Several came up and shook our 
		hands and we were happy to find two other Americans also visiting. The 
		President made us feel at home when he led the way to the head table and 
		placed us on either side of him. This we felt was an unexpected honor.<br>
		<br>The meal was delicious and because the President had traveled a 
		great deal we talked together on subjects familiar to, both. At 2:15 the 
		meeting was called to order After introductions a gentleman gave a short 
		talk on his recent trip. Then the President asked Dick to speak. Of 
		course Dick was forewarned and was ready to do himself proud with a good 
		15 minute spiel about Rotary experiences and travel impressions. The 
		speech was well received and soon we were saying goodbye to the 
		president and to Mr. Voelker from Potsdam, New York, who is traveling 
		cheaply by train around Germany and getting a great kick out of it.<br>
		<br>We were surely in luck, for one of the members, Mr.Sattler, an 
		architect, offered to guide us for the afternoon. We didn’t have any 
		idea of the treat ahead. First, Mr. Sattler is full of energy and many 
		times we felt ourselves falling behind. However, I believe we used our 
		time to the best advantage. He first took us into the old part of town, 
		showing us buildings, towers surrounded by construction, and pointed out 
		where the moat used to be. From a second story window he pointed into 
		the busy street below. ‘Look at that valley”, meaning that at one time 
		where we were standing was the wall, and outside was as yet uninhabited. 
		Now we see the city market, an old beer garden with its hall built into 
		the wall, a venison market where deer meat is sold and now is a very old 
		landmark decorated with greens and deer heads. Wesaw the city market, an 
		old beer garden, and a venison market where deer meat is sold, decorated 
		with with greens and deer heads, these eventually placed in in a “keller 
		“located in an almost deserted alley. These were things our nimble elder 
		showed us. and what we admired most was his genuine appreciation of the 
		really old things in the city and his knowledge of the architectural 
		styles of each period<br><br>. By climbing a staircase we were led into 
		the old town meeting hall, or Rathaus, consisting of a magnificent 
		banquet hall with a wooden barrel-like ceiling which is said to be one 
		of the most notable interiors in old Germany. Light coming through 
		gothic windows illuminated the many Guild flags around the room, while 
		at one end hung a huge eagle. Small curved figures representing a 
		Marasuka Dancer and done by Erasmus Grasser, enhanced the blithesome 
		decorations on the wall. From what we gather, modern Gothic is much 
		softer, more colorful and informal then the stiff designs of the old. As 
		we entered the Peters Krohe we were reminded that the decorations inside 
		would be made of wood instead of sculptured stone as in Italy, and 
		because of fire and disaster, only a few works would survive.<br><br>It 
		seems that the churches of Munich were originally Gothic, but during the 
		Renascence and other periods of change, the style has too changed. This 
		church is an old parish church and decorations of with wood carvings 
		give a pleasing baroque appearance. We didn’t realize when entering a 
		small door in the corner of the church that we were in for a real climb 
		to to the tower for its view. This is of the twelfth century and later 
		remodeled after a fire in the fourteenth century. The tower commands a 
		full panorama of the city and mountains to the south. Every day the 
		keeper at the top flies a flag, white and when the view is good and red 
		if it is poor. Very helpful to us tourists. In the tower we were shown 
		the marvelously engraved old bell that still rings as it did in medieval 
		days.<br><br>Our next visit was to the Cathedral Frauen Kirche, a 
		massive red brick edifice and again gothic. The interior is plain and 
		simple and there were some impressive light effects from the stained 
		glass windows. In the back is the tomb if the Emperor Ludwig, the 
		eccentric and artistic Bavarian who was at odds with the Pope and joined 
		this church as a result.<br><br>Our next visit was to 
		St.Michaels-Kirche, the most stupendous creation in ecclesiastical 
		architecture which the German Renaissance produced. What interested us 
		was that the Bavarian royal burial vault occupied the crypt, while above 
		us a barrel-shaped ceiling of gigantic proportions added to the artist’s 
		desired effective result. And did finish things nicely.<br><br>Mr. 
		Sattler took us into a quiet garden square of the Jesuit order where 
		there was once a very beautiful cloister for the monks and priests to 
		study in. It was a revelation for us to realize that such a lovely spot 
		can be found today in the center of a modern frenetic city.<br><br>Then 
		we visited several famous beer houses, the new Socialist buildings, 
		Hitler’s headquarters here,the Brown House, and the technical high 
		school. There we entered and looked at the latest thing in lecture 
		rooms, as well as students working and drafting. Dick was impressed with 
		the facilities for light and said he thought we were behind in 
		advancements of this kind. Mr. Sattler then led us to the art school 
		where he is a professor and e teacher of the process of pottery making. 
		A very pretty English speaking girl explained such things as glazing, 
		heating, and molding on the rotating disc machines. This work room makes 
		it own modeling substances from powder, water, and clay. Then the figure 
		of a teapot or pitcher is modeled by the students who then cook the 
		final article. Both painting and glazing are done here to be fol;lowed 
		by the finishing oven and the article then goes to market.<br><br>
		Following this we walked to a street car line. caught a ride, and were 
		soon entering Mr. Sattler’s small and beautifully furnished home. We 
		found his wife, daughter, and son to be equally refined, and we greatly 
		enjoyed talking and having refreshments with them. This “refreshment” is 
		very popular and very good. It is made from raspberries, sugar, and 
		water, making a quite wonderful drink.<br><br>As it was growing late, 
		Dick and I thanked Mr. Sattler, said goodbye to to Miss Sattler and 
		young Master Sattler, and finally the head of the house as a wonderful 
		afternoon came to an end. Next was a fast walk into town for our 
		bicycles and to ride to our hostel before 9:30 for that is the time we 
		must be inside or out for the night. By 10:30 all is quiet and we are 
		sound asleep. Love Ted.<br><br><br>021.....MUNICH JUNE 24 D<br><br>I am 
		sitting at one of the tables in our jugendherberge’s backyard, 
		scratching so down a few words while three German fellows are having a 
		great time looking through our dictionary for familiar phrases. One has 
		a brother in Chicago, I have learned as our sparse German begins to 
		become effective. All we really can do is laugh as we try and 
		communicate. These fellows are regular guys anxious to be friends and 
		always ready to help. We are picking up the language slowly and hope we 
		may study it thoroughly at Stanford, then come here again. It is the one 
		language so far that appeals to us and that we might do well with. Three 
		more fellows have now sat down opposite me and are doing very nicely 
		with the jam and milk. We’re a regular little club here with everyone 
		trying to make me understand what he is saying, but not much hope yet<br>
		<br>.<br><br>June 22<br><br><br><br>Boy, what a day! Somehow I always 
		seem to get the nerve racking days to describe as Ted and I take turns, 
		but if you can take it so can I. There is very little to say, though, 
		although we went strong all day and were dog tired by nightfall. Mr. 
		Rupe, son of a prominent Rotarian was to pick us up at 8 AM for a day’s 
		ride to Mittenwald, Garmisch, and Oberammergau. At 8;30 he pulled up 
		with Maria Sattler, and off we went. The morning was beautiful and we 
		looked forward to a super day.<br><br>However, Mr. Rupe drove like a 
		raving maniac all the way, taking 10 cents of rubber off on every turn, 
		and keeping us continuously scared. We simply held our breaths for eight 
		hours, hearts in mouths. His car is only a year old and already a wreck. 
		I cannot speak much about the country because we saw nothing and I 
		figure the least said about that part of the day the better. The fact is 
		that we are going back again on bikes and will tell about that later.<br>
		<br>Everything was not quite as bad as it would seem, for we enjoyed a 
		wonderful lunch at Elmau and tea in Garmisch with Major Overton’s friend 
		Fraulein Knauerhase. Elmau is really a heaven on earth, lying at the 
		base of the Alps and away from everything. There is a road in but no 
		cars are allowed.<br><br>The hotel, or Schloss Elmau was built by 
		Professor Sattler, and is beautiful in its simplicity. Everyone eats in 
		the great dining hall and at long tables, taking a different seat each 
		meal while being served by attractive girls who spend their summers here 
		earning their keeps. All are from leading families. Everyone knows 
		everyone else and during the eight days or more spent there, a congenial 
		spirit builds. Eight days is the minimum stay and six marks is the 
		pension (room and board) rate. This is remarkably cheap for such rooms, 
		meals , and priceless atmosphere at about $1.50 a day. Marvelous hikes 
		and bike rides radiate from Elmau, which also possesses, a beautiful 
		lake for swimming, surrounded by rolling mounded green slopes doted with 
		alpine log huts, rugged cliffs rising above.<br><br>We will never forget 
		our half hour beside the little lake, a tiny wonderland of beauty made 
		more unreal by shrill “coo coos” from far off in the forest and sharp 
		clear yodels from high on the mountains. This was one of those rare 
		treats worth alone the day’s ride. The sky threatened as it hid the sun 
		while we soaked up the woodland beauty, and our friends soaked in the 
		lake.<br><br>Maria’s uncle and family, our Elmau hosts and owners of the 
		resort insisted that we stay for tea, which turned out to be a dinner, 
		as far as we were concerned. Then tea, more tea, and cakes. We finally 
		managed to break away, thanking them for a super time in the grandest 
		and homiest nook we have yet found.<br><br>What a wonderful base it 
		would be for travels in Switzerland and Austria, and of course Germany. 
		You would love it, Mom and Dad. The building itself is bare of paint 
		inside its walls and floors kept spotlessly clean with scrubbing. Every 
		window has its own beautiful view for it is truly a fairyland.<br><br>By 
		the time we left the rain was coming down in buckets, obscuring the 
		countryside. A quick glimpse of the Olympic jumps sufficed in Garmisch, 
		after which we drove to Burgestrasse 55, letter in hand from Major 
		Overton, and what a reception we met. The Fraulein was overjoyed to meet 
		us, friends of the Overtons, of whom she thinks so much. She bowled us 
		over with hospitality, insisting that we have a cup of tea. We could not 
		refuse, especially when she brought in some home made cakes which melted 
		in our mouths. She had just received a letter from Mr. Clock and was 
		full of questions about the Overtons. They surely have wonderful 
		friends, and we feel honored to carry letters of introduction from them. 
		General Cottica and the Fraulein are special people–so very real. It was 
		with great regret that we said goodbye carrying with us her best to the 
		Overtons. If we would return she would ‘bake a cake “especially for 
		you”, she said, and it is with her hospitality in mind that we will 
		return to Gamisch. We cannot leave Bavaria without returning to 
		Mittenwald, Garmisch, and Oberammergau and spending a day in the 
		Fraulein's lovely chalet pension.<br><br>Tomorrow, if the day dawns 
		hopefully we will ride again through the Bavarian highlands on bikes 
		this time, where the value received is 500% higher than any car journey 
		can provide<br><br>As it was getting late and we had quietly made up our 
		minds to return, going to Oberammergau made little difference. The 
		Passion Play Theater was closed for the night, cinching our decision to 
		come back. However we did not get through town unhindered. Cattle were 
		strung out along the entire main street and going where they pleased, 
		taking their times while the boy herder paid them no attention. And what 
		ornery critters they were! But the funniest thing of all came when one 
		of the biggest animals parked herself in the doorway of the town’s 
		smallest cafe, and gave vent to her feelings with “moos” which fairly 
		blew out the windows. Everyone was busy snapping pictures and having 
		just as an uproarious time as the cow. We left her unsatisfied and she 
		may still be there.<br><br>The ride back was in the expected manner, Ted 
		and I surpressing exclamations of deep feeling, especially on bumps. 
		Yes, we remained gentlemen. When the right rear tire finally gave up we 
		had to inform our driver before he realized it. Storm clouds were 
		catching up with us, so we worked fast, only to find that the jack 
		handle was missing. After our chauffeur had made a general mess of 
		everything, Lyon Repair Service took charge, using a wrench for a handle 
		and completing the job. Our leather shorts also turned their first shade 
		darker as we groveled in the gravel. It will take about sixty more 
		“flats” before our pants will be seasoned and the real thing, and as 
		Bavarians we can stand them in the corner for the night.<br><br>What a 
		glorious feeling to be finally in bed after “just one of those days”, 
		firmly determined to ride on our own ponies through the Bavarian 
		highlands again,. We would rather ride a mile and push a mile than see 
		the country through a needle’s eye. We’ve ridden with three German 
		drivers so far, and two of them don’t believe in slowing up to let the 
		turns go by. So here’s to Europe on bikes. “Good night” in five 
		different languages featured the evening, before all drooped off to 
		sleep. French, German, Belgian, Czechoslovakian, and English. What a 
		day!<br><br>Munich is a grand city, and we will be sorry to leave it. 
		Our experiences so far in Germany have left only fine impressions. 
		Everyone is cheerful and works hard. When anything needs fixing, we know 
		that the job will be well done. Everyone is interested in us and anxious 
		to be friendly, we being handicapped by our ignorance of German. 
		However, we are making headway as we pick up six or seven words each day 
		so that now when we wish to buy something we get along fine. Our 
		ambition now is to study German and return again, staying in the 
		Jugendgherbergs and seeing this country again in the finest way. Bavaria 
		is just as picturesque as its name suggested to us, and we are loathe to 
		leave it. We have found the youths to be highly musical but lacking in 
		instruction on the instruments themselves, such as the piano. its not 
		hard to imagine ourselves in America, for German and American youths are 
		full of the same life and vigor, differing only in speech.<br><br>Must 
		sign off for now, for there are socks to darn and “thank you” letters to 
		write. Dick<br><br><br><br>24 June 26 Garmisch <br><br>Today Everett 
		Brown will make the final step and also Uncle Tom and family will start 
		for Hawaii. It’s lovely here on the the verandah of the Villa Reiter 
		with heaven full of clouds, a panorama full of mountains, and an 
		atmosphere full of quiet. This morning we slept till late 7:30 in our so 
		comfortable beds, the first such in many day. Then, after a short 
		playful-tiff on my bed-you know who started it-we enjoyed a delicious 
		breakfast in the morning air. Here on the same verandah. At ten we 
		pushed off in the direction of Oberammergau and the Schloss Linderhof.<br>
		<br>We climbed the short grade to the upper valley from Oberu, using the 
		system of fifty steps and fifty pumps, and found the system works 
		easily. We were expecting to come upon a massive turreted structure on 
		some lofty promontory, but instead found a small square building in 
		Rococo style amidst lovely gardens, armored walks, statues, and 
		fountains. At noon the fountains began to play and their effect quite 
		wonderful, especially about the main one in the center front pond. From 
		a golden statue group, a sting stream of water shot 70 or so feet into 
		the air, to falter at the top and then return down, shimmering on the 
		gold leaf surfaces. Unfortunately the sun had forsaken us and 
		threatening clouds were coming in from the north.<br><br>We were anxious 
		to see the interior. At 12:15 the guide appeared with a group of twenty 
		and we started around, reading explanations from the guidebook. From the 
		center hallway, containing really antique cloisonné vases, we climbed a 
		magnificent staircase of Austrian marble to the first of ten rooms. Each 
		room was beautiful, filled to overflowing with gold leaf and bright 
		colors which might at first seem gaudy and disagreeable, but to us 
		somehow the arrangements and selections made everything just about as 
		lovely as a fairy castle should be. There are costly Gobelin tapestries, 
		exquisite terra cottas, superb immense mirrors all placed effectively 
		and bordered by an abundance of gold leaf wood carving, porcelain pieces 
		from Nymphenburg and elsewhere and regal systole chandeliers that 
		related well to the mirrors as images were replicated as far as the eye 
		can see, as in a barbershop.<br><br>Our guide became a bit disgusted 
		with us when we lagged behind to admire each article, but each demanded 
		such admiration for what it really is. Louise IV seemed to capture the 
		show, but there were some others that figured prominently. We were 
		especially taken with the bed-chamber, the largest and most sensational 
		of all the rooms. The canopied bed was in blue, while the remainder of 
		the room was a rich gold. A ceiling painting, a huge chandelier, and 
		some white statues of Greek figures all beautified the room.<br><br>We 
		were sorry to leave, but after a short walk bout the stately gardens we 
		found the rain prodding us onward. Back down the valley we rode to 
		Oberammergau.<br><br>First we had lunch of milk and buns with some 
		friendly English hikers, and then we started to look at the town. There 
		had been a confirmation service in the church that morning and many were 
		dressed in their Sunday best. The women wore long black and brown 
		dresses with embroidered silk shawls around their shoulders. About the 
		neck was black or white lace of exquisite quality, and with braided hair 
		and hats that resemble those of the Roman student priests with flat 
		domes and turned up brims, the braided tassel behind, they too on the 
		look back many years in the evolution of the dress. The little girls 
		wore white dresses and bows in their double braided hair, looking very 
		much like dolls. The men all wore dark suits, rather tight coats and 
		high water pants. You could tell they weren’t used to this gay 
		outfitting for one gentleman was in the process of taking off his 
		strangling cravat. The boys also dressed in dark blue with white shirts, 
		white tuxedo collars and neat white bow ties. Everyone was at his best, 
		very proud and well mannered.<br><br>We were anxious to see the shops 
		and the Passion Play Theater, so we moved along into the curio shop of 
		Anton Lang who takes the part of The Christ in the famous drama. We saw 
		him with his kind bearded face behind the counter, waiting on some 
		English people who were paying close attention to him. Across the road 
		was a wood carver’s shop and inside was another bearded gentleman 
		working on a rough image of the Crucifix. These are the town specialty. 
		We wondered what part he takes in the play every ten years. And there 
		were others around who appeared to be participants. On many of the house 
		and near their doorways are the names of people who take certain parts.<br>
		<br>By this time we were ready to see the theater, a good sized building 
		set off to the side of the town’s center. The theater was not inspiring 
		or imposing, but behind the stage the guide showed us the various 
		dressing rooms. It sounded funny to hear him in broken English, “And 
		there is the dressing room of King Herrod”. The costumes were 
		interesting and we saw the cross the man who takes the part of Jesus 
		hangs on to for 22 minutes in the play.<br><br>When we emerged after our 
		short inspection of the theater, rain had begun again and since it 
		looked like one of those long lingering showers, we started back to the 
		Villa. It was a memorable wetting cool ride, but we found warmth and a 
		change of clothes waiting at the finish. After some tea and a piece of 
		Fraulein’s lovely cake, we well with the world again.<br><br>Learning 
		German is a kick. There are about six ladies living here who take great 
		delight in helping us. By the way, I forgot to mention that the 
		inhabitants around here take the Passion Play lightly. Very few have 
		seen it. The natives don’t seem to think anything of it. They say that 
		there are more Americans attending than any other nationality. Also the 
		guide said there were some 400,000 attending during 1934, the 300th 
		anniversary and the play is performed every ten years. <br><br><br>26 
		Augsburg June 30 D<br><br>We’re one more day along on our journey 130 
		kilometers north of Garmisch with 140 ahead to Nurnberg. Early tomorrow 
		we will pass the 2000 mark, since arriving in Rome where we bought our 
		cyclometer. The Jugendherberge is very quiet now as fellows sit about 
		reading and writing. We can see the moon coming up with trees in 
		silhouette for the first time in many days. We are fifteen words ahead 
		in German today and can sit back meditating with satisfaction on the 
		whys and wherefores of rain.<br><br>Yesterday, June 30, was another full 
		one and of unexpected virtues. Our plan was to leave Garmisch in the 
		morning, riding to Augsburg, but when we awakened to find prospects for 
		a fine day at a new high we started contemplating how nice it would be 
		to stay in Garmisch and hike to some mountain inspiration points.<br>
		<br>Fraulein’s delicious breakfast was the deciding factor, breaking 
		down our resistance. It was only then that we realized how difficult it 
		would be to leave our Garmisch home. At the moment, a squad of singing 
		brown shirts, Nazi unarmed troops with brown shirts, beach ties and 
		riding pants with black leggings and brown military hats is marching by. 
		These fellows sing well and with gusto.<br><br><br><br>continued in 
		Nurenberg.<br><br><br><br>Today is July 2nd and we’re a long way behind 
		in our writing. It is sure hard to believe that the 4th is almost here 
		and your birthday, Mom, only a few days hence. We surely like to munch a 
		little of the angel food cake on the 10th. Hope you liked our birthday 
		thoughts for you,<br><br>Continued --June 29.<br><br><br><br>This will 
		have to be shorter and I hope sweeter for time passes. Boy, my mouth 
		waters when I think of that breakfast at the Villa Reiter before 
		starting out for a day of activity.<br><br>Kreuzenhaus is situated five 
		thousand feet high on the Kreuz summit. it was our first goal, so we 
		rode across Garmisch to the base of the mountains at the valley’s 
		southern edge. The early morning and evening views of this range are 
		grand from the Villa, with the towering Zugspitze far off in the distant 
		background. In front stands the Alpspitze that is not as high but as it 
		resembles the Matterhorn, it is more majestic. Both peaks are snow 
		capped and wispy clouds play about them in sort of an alpine hide and 
		seek. Below in the foreground stands Kreuzech Ridge.<br><br>famous for 
		the panoramic views it affords.<br><br>We locked our bikes to a fence at 
		the mountain's foot and started up, sweaters tied at the waists for the 
		day was already warm. A short quick climb brought us to Riesser See, a 
		small lake forming a striking setting for the jagged peaks above.<br>
		<br>A number of vacationers were enjoying the water’s coolness, but we 
		could not be tempted so moved on. Real climbing started there, and 
		continued for an hour and a half, we moving at a good clip. The trail 
		weaved sharply back and forth up the mountain, sometimes through sunlit 
		stretches but mostly in the refreshing coolness of the shade. Green 
		grassy clearings were especially beautiful, abundant with wildflowers 
		and with an occasional lonely hut. As we climbed higher fine views of 
		the valley stretched in all directions accompanied by the music of 
		cattle bells as the animals clung confidently to precipitous slopes 
		while munching luscious looking grass. One tiny herder boy equipped only 
		with a long pole was the master and kept the herd in order. Every time 
		we hear a cowbell, our tongues cry for milk and we just can’t get 
		enough.<br><br>We passed many hikers going up and down, for the 
		Bavarians are great outdoor people who love to walk. It was great to see 
		the old folks taking it slow and easy and getting there just the same. 
		Elderly ladies with packs on their backs, and young old men always cane 
		in hand, chugging up the path and greeting us as they passed with a 
		smiling “Guten Morgen”. These grandmothers and grandfathers have joints 
		that are well lubricated.<br><br>Ted’s real silk tennis shoe footwear 
		stood the task so that we did arrive on the top hungry and thirsty just 
		in time to put away delicious glasses of milch along with some dates, 
		not the grandest of meals but almost nectar to us.<br><br>The views from 
		Kreuzech were grand, obstructed only by a haze hanging over the valley. 
		The sun was by this time playing hide and seek with ominous clouds , so 
		that we received our best looks only spasmodically. The three radiating 
		valleys below stretched out to the point that one can see the Eib See, 
		then Mittenwald, and in the center, Murnau, with the Starnberger See 
		faintly visible in the distance.<br><br>Garmisch Partenkirchen lay dead 
		center below us. The Alspitze seemed only a few yards away, but we saved 
		it ascent for some later day.<br><br>After our sumptuous repast and a 
		few minutes rest, we took one look through the telescope for 10 
		pfennings, discovering to our surprise climbers on the Alpspitze, not 
		visible to the naked eye, who had started along the ridge trail leading 
		toward the Alspitze glacial valley and finally back to Garmisch. Two 
		Bavarian mountaineers, both real characters, put us on the right track 
		and relieved our doubts about the trip down. It is great fun exercising 
		our Deutsch on these fellows who can really take it. Our vocabulary is 
		still very limited, so at ten word a day it will stay difficult for a 
		while.<br><br>Up and down we climbed for a kilometer to Rupfleiten Jock, 
		a narrow saddle on which rested many climbers, all admiring the valley 
		view which was becoming poorer as clouds rolled in.<br><br>The trail 
		went straight down from there, it seemed, toward the valley floor. That 
		slide down was an experience not devoid of thrills. The trail was cut 
		out of solid rock for the most part, and was just a few feet in width 
		with nothing between you and a long drop almost straight down to some 
		uncomfortable looking spots. Loose gravel and slippery limestone 
		surfaces kept us continuously on the alert In many places cable 
		handrails had been placed, especially around corners over “nothing” and 
		a little safety on wide stretches. We passed many a climber stepping 
		with great care, women for the most part whose shoes and feet were 
		accustomed more to a dance floor than a mountain devil slide.<br><br>
		Half way down we felt the first raindrops, so hurried on before a 
		possible deluge, having no bathing suits. We crossed several mountain 
		streams pouring through long limestone canyons, and although we looked 
		and looked for a beautiful Alpine Rose, only one bedraggled specimen 
		rewarded our effort. They are in danger of extinction, and we believe 
		this from the numerous signs saying “Picking Alpine Roses forbidden”: 
		The word of course is “Verboten”, an institution in these parts.<br><br>
		Rain was coming down in deadly earnest, so a quick survey up the small 
		valley at the Alpspitze's foot sufficed before we hurried on down the 
		path. Just as it looked as if we were in for a real drenching, the path 
		turned into a tunnel in the limestone. This looked like a haven of 
		refuge, but hopes were dampened by the constant dripping from the 
		tunnels side and top. It was evidently not built for six footers without 
		raincoats, for we had to duck low trying to miss the internal streams. 
		The tunnel continued on, interesting at first, but it gradually dropped 
		into a stream gauged gorge, where we gained views every twenty yards or 
		so. The old path had evidently been washed out for traces of it were 
		visible along the canyon wall, and this new tunnel is an admirable feat. 
		Going down and down, the gorge narrower and narrower, deeper and deeper, 
		and the river roared louder and louder. Miniature falls shot from above 
		while others dribbled from vents in the rocks, keeping the air 
		continuously damp.<br><br>It was a beautiful sight and really thrilling 
		with a new and finer view at each turn. The water churned to a snowy 
		whiteness at points where the gorge snaked to extreme narrowness. By the 
		time we reached the canyon’s end rain had turned to a drizzle. It seemed 
		is if fate had placed these tunnels of refuge from a storm especially 
		for us.<br><br>The show was not to be free, however, for 50 pfennings 
		were painlessly extracted from each at the toll gate. We had received 
		our full value and the strange thing was that no citizen or tourist 
		agent had expounded on the glories of this wonder, known as the 
		Hollentall Klamm. This beat the Rhine Fall by miles, perhaps because we 
		had expected nothing.<br><br>We fairly ran through green forests legs 
		weary from the downhill jogging, to Hammerstach and the valley floor. It 
		was still some distance to town so we struck out but had gone only a 
		half mile when the skies opened up again. Shelter was found beneath me 
		of the lonely log houses where we spent the time learning some more 
		German from Hugo’s Grammer. As the storm passed we set out once more, 
		pausing often to admire the landscape. I think the country is the most 
		beautiful after a rain when the sun turns water soaked leaves and roofs 
		into shimmering jewels and clouds break exposing the blue sky and rugged 
		peaks. However, we’d just as soon trade these liquid jewels for a couple 
		of good coats of summer tan.<br><br>We arrived back at the Villa tired 
		and of course famished and again Fraulein came to our rescue in her own 
		inimitable style with this time with lemon pudding saved especially for 
		us. The German word for delicious is “Kostlich” which we remember by 
		thinking of custard and how we licked the dish. Dinner was super as 
		usual and we had an interesting discussion with a new member of the 
		household who speaks English. He is a teacher of English and French. He 
		told us that the German youth are now passing through a stage of 
		enthusiastic military and athletic participation in the zeal for the 
		“new movement’ as they forsake the arts, literature and science almost 
		completely. But this is just one stage in the development of the new 
		Germany with the hope that more worthy objectives finally surface in the 
		end. We find this enthusiasm a live and burning thing, as we live with 
		the German youth. ‘Heil Hitler” constantly greets us we ride from 
		passing bicyclists and hikers, while the older men in taverns or fields 
		greet with “Guten Tag”. Old Germany seems not willing to accept what 
		seems inevitable, but young Deutschland is crying its glory to the 
		world. The Fuhrer has certainly placed himself in the hearts of the 
		young. There is much to say on both sides, and we will save this until 
		latter<br><br>In fifteen minute we meet with Mr. Stemmed, secretary of 
		Nuremberg Rotary, to go for supper in a true “beer keller”. There is 
		really so much to say and so little time to say it. We received a swell 
		letter from Wins. He surely deserves every satisfaction he is receiving, 
		and more power on licking envelopes..D27 Nuremberg July 3 <br><br><br>
		<br><br><br>Continued..Next day<br><br><br><br>Today is the great 4th 
		but it is just another day for us for old man sin must have heard that 
		we are planning to start for Heidelberg this afternoon. He, or she, is 
		liquidating in his usual unappreciated manner forcing us to spend the 
		time inside. However there is much writing to do so it’s just as well. 
		On our next trip abroad are planning to start in Lapland in the dead of 
		winter, working down slowly to avoid the summer rains.<br><br>During 
		yesterday morning, and a really long one it was, for we were on the road 
		at 8:39-think of it--we pedaled over rolling country with lovely farms, 
		old and new, and through quaint tiny villages. Peasants worked in the 
		fields, doing all the labor by hand aided, perhaps, by a horse and in 
		just one case by a tractor, the first we have seen in many a day. The 
		women always with colored kerchiefs tied over their heads and usually in 
		white, blue, red make real the mental picture we have formed in America 
		as we have imagined how the other half of the world lives. Sunshine 
		flooded everything, and great white clouds hung lazily above. Roadside 
		crucifixes are becoming fewer and fewer as we ride north. In Southern 
		Bavaria every farm had its carved crucifix.<br><br>Donausworth, just 46 
		kilometers from Augsburg, is a quaint very old town on the River Donau, 
		and as yet has not met the modern world as we pumped over its rough 
		cobblestone main street. This is a matter unforgettable just as is the 
		tiny grocery store we purchased two apples for 30 pfennings and munched 
		them in the shade just outside of town. Already stomachs were asking for 
		sustenance for we can’t live on beauty alone in every tiny hamlet of 
		town. Quaint barnyard scenes greet our eyes, and many a time we had to 
		pull over while ox drawn hay or fertilizer carts rolled by manned by 
		sleepy characters who seem to have supreme confidence in their equally 
		drowsy looking animals. Few automobiles were met, so we enjoyed the 
		countryside peacefulness to its fullest. These Bavarian old timers are 
		great, shuffling along slowly on the road, their strange pipes swinging 
		like pendulums from their mouths.<br><br>It was only 11:30 but out 
		tongues were hanging out with desire for food as we approached Jktzing 
		(Yo say it). But can you imagine our surprise to find not a store in the 
		town, and hardly any sign of one. We had seen nothing quite like this 
		before. It w is just a tiny hamlet of quaint peasant houses, with a 
		light blanket of dust over everything. Evidently its inhabitants all 
		were out in the fields, leaving chickens and ducks in full charge. It 
		was just packed with picturesque nooks and crannies undiscovered, of 
		course, by tourist hordes. To make the picture complete, a smiling goose 
		boy came down the narrow dusty unpaved main street, driving his flock of 
		cackling milk-feathered ducks before him. His plain little staff, 
		handled deftly, kept the more rambunctious elements in order. It was a 
		scene we have seen many times in art galleries, but never expected to 
		meet in real life. I dearly hope my snapshot will come out.<br><br>We 
		simply could go no longer without food so sat down by the side of the 
		road and finished the bread and jam remaining from breakfast, along with 
		water furnished by the Jtzing Public Works Administration in its town 
		water trough. This light repast, just an appetizer, held us for the 
		remaining five kilometers to Monheim, another lazy old village, hot and 
		dusty. But for milk we had to go to the village dairy high on the hill 
		where we were served with the greatest of beverages on the dairy’s 
		steps. Satisfied at last, we lay for many minutes in the roadside shade, 
		allowing the delicacies to digest.<br><br>The early afternoon passed 
		quickly as we pedaled more rapidly over a fairly level country, broken 
		occasionally by short pulls. One stretch, however, we’ll not forget, for 
		it went up and down over dusty roads that loosened everything inside our 
		insides, while we prayed for no punctures. It’s real work riding this 
		type of cow path.<br><br>Wessenburg is the superest old town we have yet 
		seen, remaining today as it was in the time of Knights and Ladies. The 
		ancient town hall still stands in parts, with its four cornered towers 
		informing tourists as they approach that they are now in the heart of a 
		land filled with musk of past grandeur and pageantry. Wessenburg took to 
		us and we to it, from the moment we drank from its lovely fountain.<br>
		<br>Time was flying and Nurnberg was still more than 50 kilometers away, 
		but we just had to spend some minutes wandering through narrow lanes and 
		byways or across the few town squares, sopping up the loveliness around 
		us. The houses were plastered, with beams and other woodwork exposed in 
		delightful Symmetry. What really thrilled us were the tiny glass 
		enclosed balconies with geranium and peony filled windows. These flowers 
		fairly spring from every window and add so much beauty. And the grill 
		work signs in silhouette add the final touch, seen against the sky, as 
		they more or less frame our views.<br><br>One barnyard is vivid in our 
		minds and right in the center of town too. Through the open barnyard 
		door we see framed perfectly the sprawling Bavarian barn, hay strewn 
		cobblestones, and a rickety old grain wagon. Our camera didn’t let us 
		down so you too will see it.<br><br>We hated to leave but the minutes 
		were flying and we had tasted just enough of the old here to wish to see 
		Nurnberg as soon as possible. Ellwaggen, another grand old village 
		passed by, and then came Roth where we stopped to pay proper homage with 
		toasts of milk and confiture (snails ) carried out in proper style while 
		answering the shopkeeper’s questions between gulps. Schwabdorf was next 
		and took us down its cobblestone main street which gives these French 
		bikes the real jitters. A few kilometers more brought us into Nurnberg, 
		the city of our dreams and hopes. The usual trouble with street surfaces 
		and our confusion in trying to understand a cop’s gesticulations were 
		combined with our attempts to get directions to the Jugenherberge, the 
		same queries we experience in each new city. Again, a friendly youth 
		came to our aid, taking us to the hostel. There we showered in ice cold 
		water, slicked up, and walked a few blocks down the Konigstrasse, the 
		main street, to the Motkeller where we enjoyed a good dinner, which also 
		served to leaden the eyelids.<br><br>The Motkeller, or meat cellar, is 
		one of Nurnberg’s most known restaurants, situated in the cellar of one 
		of the old grain store houses used during early times to keep stocked 
		for sieges and it is usually built into the fortifications well inside 
		the moat. We were quite disappointed in the “keller” itself, finding 
		only newly painted Gothic pillars and vaulted ceiling instead of the 
		musky old hall we expected. The dinner was good and the waitress full of 
		smiles, so we enjoyed the time, even if the three tiny pears we had for 
		desert would get “the bird” in California.<br><br>All the good beds were 
		occupied in the Jugendherberge so again we forced to sleep on the low 
		cots in the attic. Being too tired to care what we slept on, we hit the 
		hay, interrupted only when rain cam through the skylight, dampening Ted 
		slightly right in the midst of a sweet dream. Rain has stopped now so we 
		will walk over to the house of Albrecht Durer, immortal pioneering 
		Nurnberg artist and noted for his engravings (etchings) to see some of 
		his works, but most important, just to see his house as he lived in 
		it..D.<br><br><br><br>27 Nurnberg July 2<br><br>As the last day of June 
		dawned the Lyon brothers were far behind schedule still in the lovely 
		Garmisch country. But on this day we had to leave and were not 
		anticipating it. The breakfast with the Fraulein who saw to it that we 
		ate enough marmalade, pronounced “marmalada” that means just “jam”, was 
		more appreciated than ever. Afterwards we were told that the 
		Burgermeister of Garmisch had called previously with orders that anyone 
		staying in town must pay a certain fee for each night’s lodging. 
		However, the ever thoughtful Fraulein had presented our case as students 
		with the result that we were to present ourselves at the Rathaus, so up 
		to the city hall we rode, carrying our Jugendherberge cards as evidence. 
		And sure enough the gentleman knew his business and in a short time we 
		had settled the matter.<br><br>Back at the Villa Reiter after our last 
		ride on the cobblestone street, we put packs on bikes and prepared to 
		say Goodbye, first to Herr and Frau Reiter who own the Villa and then to 
		friends who wished us “Bon Voyage” and “Good Luck” many times. And then, 
		after thanking Fraulein over and over with honest to goodness lumps in 
		our throats, we received from her a lovely Spring rose and rode down the 
		lane waving Goodbye to her at the gate. We knew that one of the happiest 
		experiences of our lives had just ended, but with our writing and 
		photographs the joy can be rekindled in the future<br><br>The way to 
		Oberammergau was made through another drizzle, and from then on the 
		weather improved and we could see a bit of the country. What we liked 
		about it, although plenty hilly, is the change from surroundings of 
		picturesque villages to fields of grain filled with people, and to the 
		quiet forests for which Bavaria is so well known. All of the way we 
		dodged rain clouds to the small town of Schongau, about 50 kilometers on 
		our way, where a wetting rain descended. We stopped, ate sugared buns, 
		and drank several glasses of refreshing milch. When we lunch this way in 
		a small “milchhaus” the lady or man keeper is usually quite curious 
		about us so in pigeon German we explain that we are Americans on 
		bicycles, having traveled so far, and plan to travel so far although the 
		“vetter ist sehr slecht.” We like these people tremendously because they 
		are so friendly and so honest, plain, and strong.<br><br>In the 
		afternoon as we followed the Tech River down, we had a good road for a 
		change. At one place near a military center where there are fine new 
		buildings for the men we hit another cloudburst and had to seek shelter 
		in a small cabin in a field.<br><br>About 5 o’clock we galloped wearily 
		over the cobblestones of Augsburg. Neither the telephone book nor Banhof 
		(railway station) had any idea where the hostel was and we were ready to 
		look for a Fremdenzimmer when Dick happened to ask a bicycler and to our 
		surprise he knew where the Jugendberge was and offered to show us the 
		way. There we found a shower and a change of clothes after which we 
		walked to the center of town.<br><br>It is interesting to note that this 
		town was at first a colony sent out by the Emperor Augusts in 12 B.C. 
		and from the 14th to the 16th century is was a great commercial center 
		as the ships of the merchant princes made sail on every sea. At this 
		time in the late Middle Ages, Augsburg was a center of world trade, a 
		major town of the Renascence and the Reformation.<br><br>With this 
		information we started out among its unusual buildings and streets. Into 
		the Cathedral we peered through bronze grills at what is said to be the 
		oldest painted glass in history while a Catholic Seville was going on 
		inside. Outside we walked down the main street bordered by venerable 
		patrician palaces and made interesting by curious fountains. What we 
		like to look for most part are the ever changing medieval roof forms, 
		the lettering over the portes and on the front of business houses, and 
		the gas lamps at every corner. As we returned to our lodging at sunset 
		along a picturesque canal we realized that all we had against such towns 
		is the cobblestone byways for we are wondering just how long our bikes 
		will continue to stand up under such beating.<br><br>For dinner our 
		hostel father directed us to a real “Gestatte’ or Inn of about 4th class 
		where men sat at tables “mugging” beer and the keeper kept the mugs 
		filled. The ox fleisch we ate wasn’t quite as good or as satisfying as 
		the surroundings. In the dim light we could discern deer antlers, old 
		pictures and sketches, and an ancient clock on the far wall, while 
		through an inner window we could watch the keeper in his beer pantry. 
		For a while we talked with two men from Berlin who must take the train 
		that night for their city. because one’s mother was ill.<br><br>At ten 
		o’clock we were well asleep, something that we have little trouble with 
		these nights.<br><br><br><br>Ted<br><br>Nurnberg<br><br><br><br>This 
		mooring it was a little difficult to get up after our stiff ride 
		yesterday. I had been sleeping under a small sky window until it started 
		to rain when I quickly moved to a dry spot. We dressed, packed, took our 
		them took our things down from our attic room, and secured a real bed 
		downstairs for tonight. After a breakfast of “broten, marmelade, and 
		milch” we hiked into town. When we learned that the Rotary President 
		lives 25 kilometers out of town at the University, we decided to call on 
		the Secretary at the Grand Hotel. There a lady met us and informed us 
		that we were booked for a bus tour of the city in five minutes. The tour 
		lasted far more than five minutes and as guests we enjoyed every minute 
		of the ride.<br><br>Nuremberg, or Nurnberg, occupies a portion of both 
		banks of the River Pagnitz. It’s population is 400,000, the second 
		largest city in Bavaria and it has a real history much too long to 
		recite here. One thing should be noted is that over the years, there 
		have been three distinct walls. The oldest has entirely disappeared but 
		the second and third remain in part as they give evidence of the days 
		when fortifications were necessities. We like them of course as 
		photographic images. And likewise we are entranced by the the six stone 
		bridges that span the river. At sunset these river scenes are the most 
		impressive. There is always the quaint bridge in the center with rolling 
		clouds behind and medieval buildings of Gothic designs standing on the 
		banks. Color is important for the blue sky, red tiled roofs, and bright 
		orange geraniums along the balconies combine in harmony. The city has 
		many churches that are filled with relics, but we have seen enough of 
		those. We would rather be outside taking in the old sights.<br><br>Our 
		bus trip took us to the Kaiserburg, a castle built by Frederick 
		Barbarossa in the 11th century. The best part was the view of the roofs 
		of Nurnburg, the dignified high church spires, the round green dome of 
		the synagogue, and in great contrast, the tall rather ugly factory 
		chimneys pouring out dirty smoke over these house tops. It was here in 
		the Castle that we met a fellow countryman, a banker from Cleveland who 
		complained that we were speaking English rather than American and there 
		is quite a difference with all of our newly coined words. We explained 
		that we had to speak slowly and clearly and in plain words on our trip 
		without contact with Americans, in order that we be understood by the 
		people in other countries.<br><br>As the bus trip ended we decided that 
		this sightseeing procedure is excellent for the hurried visitor on a 
		short visit. The genial guide spoke four languages, and by the time he 
		had finished speaking in German and French we had a pretty good idea of 
		what he had said.<br><br>As the trip ended we alighted and met the 
		Secretary Mr. Schmidt at the Grand Hotel. We liked him immediately. He 
		speaks English, a little rusty, but we understood each other well. Only 
		when he tried to describe something difficult, politics for instance, 
		would he get stuck, snapping his fingers in despair and in German asking 
		“How do you say it?”<br><br>It was one PM and were hungry of course. He 
		must have seen it in our eyes for we headed for food in a rather modern 
		restaurant yet of the old style. And it was one fine meal, apple cider 
		included. Afterwards and armed with our guide book, we started to out to 
		see things for ourselves.<br><br>First was the Martha Church , built in 
		1390 and used by the Meistersingers as a meeting place from 1578 to 
		1614. The interior is rather plain, more like a town hall, but we saw 
		traces of frescoes and other decorations that must have been quite 
		beautiful.<br><br>The next step was to see the house where Hans Sachs 
		lived and we found it on a side street on the north side of the river. 
		On the outside are the words “Hans Sachs Haus” in that expressive German 
		lettering and its front is typical of Nurnburg style. We entered the 
		little Inn which is quaintly decorated with fancy porcelain mugs, old 
		plates, and an ancient golden-faced clock and many small curious pieces 
		around it.<br><br>It was fascinating just to wander about the cozy room. 
		Not far away in a square is a statue of Hans just as he worked in his 
		shoemaker’s shop. It reminded us of the opera greatly. In our minds we 
		could picture those colorful old settings in the performance, especially 
		when Hans Sachs sits just outside his shop and in the dim light goes on 
		with his hammering. That kind of street was new to us at the opera, but 
		in real life it is here and everywhere, with potted geraniums, the 
		arches, and old buildings fronting cobblestone streets.<br><br>Back 
		across the river which we always like to photograph, we hiked to 
		Kernmarkt, now used as a hop market, the largest in the world. 
		Throughout the town one sees large sturdy business houses which at one 
		time were granaries, and adjoining the Kernmarket is a particularly 
		striking one.<br><br>We decided we had seen enough for one afternoon so 
		we repaired to our Palace Hotel, the hostel. At 6 o’clock we met Mr. 
		Schmidt again and drove with him to the southern outskirts of the city. 
		There we were shown the new party gathering ground for the Socialist 
		government. It is a huge affair, effectively constructed in stone and in 
		the few days of the year it is used, over a million people attending a 
		mass meeting. Around a large grass field divided in the middle by a 
		stone walk are low seating stands, and at the west is a typical 
		grandstand with a huge wooden eagle at each side. We also saw where 
		plans are going ahead for a new massive government building in contrast 
		to the close by brown wooden hospital shacks used in the war.<br><br>
		From this section we drove back to the Hans Sachs district. Down a short 
		narrow street we halted, and followed our genial host into one of the 
		loveliest cafes we have ever seen. I is unforgettable. The name is 
		famous here, Bratwurstherzle, meaning “cooked sausage heart.” The reason 
		for the cooked sausage will soon be explained, but the heart seems to be 
		the name of that section of town. At any rate, outside are tables 
		surrounded by greens. Inside we were in for a surprise,<br><br>We seated 
		ourselves at one of the only two good-sized tables. The room is small 
		and is filled with interesting objects. First of all there are the old 
		windows called “Butzenscheiben} which we would call “bottle glass,” They 
		are really rough discs of glass and were used before they learned how to 
		make today’s regular windows. The spaces between the discs are filled in 
		by metal, and in most cases the glass is multicolored with wonderful 
		effects. These windows don’t provide much illumination so as we there in 
		the early evening the lanterns strung from the ceiling and the little 
		red lamps in the corners are used for illumination. Starting from the 
		top, the wooden ceiling is supported ny rafters and on these are many 
		shields and coats of arms. Around the upper section of the wall are 
		inscriptions in striking German print, and just below runs a shelf 
		circling the room. What a collection of old steins there were! They were 
		in pewter and porcelain, mugs of every decryption. An old box clock 
		holds down the center of honor, fancy plates behind with pusywillows in 
		the corners and below them rough wooden figures. One of these is the 
		Nurnberg Madonna sharing this panorama. Bellow the shelf comes some more 
		wall pretty well covered up by comical pictures and steel engravings. 
		One crude painting depicts a sausage machine. The pig is sitting on the 
		fire and sticking his snout into the grinder, while sausages are coming 
		out the machine’s other end. Quite a process! Somewhere on the wall is 
		the name of the cafe and underneath was printed “seit 1404,” the year of 
		its claimed founding. And we can believe it. Over in a corner is an old 
		porcelain stove and near it a cabinet of equally old glassware.<br><br>
		This immediate description ended, the more important issue presents 
		itself. From the clean tiny kitchen that shown with copper ware issued a 
		smell, call it ‘fragrance,” that had the word “sausages’ plastered all 
		over it. We thought of Dad and our Sunday morning breakfasts as the 
		keeper laid down the food. This food demands special attention. Dick and 
		I were admiring the luscious crisp brown odorescent sausages around a 
		center of sauerkraut, and the plate an ordinary one but made of tin with 
		many dents, and in the shape of a heart. I thought I wasn’t going to 
		like the sauerkraut at first, but one can’t dislike anything in such an 
		atmosphere. I grieved to have to say that the first ten disappeared like 
		magic, and to the delight of our appetites another ten came steaming 
		from the kitchen and were set before us. Together with light beer and 
		bread, the dish was complete and we have never enjoyed any meal more.<br>
		<br>We finished our second plates and heartily declined a third in favor 
		of digestive gastric juice potentials. Then we recovered our coats which 
		we had hung on hangers in the center of the room. We took leave in the 
		cool night air. We thanked our host heartily and headed for home. Dick 
		had to have an ice cream cone so we had to purchase one at the automat. 
		Then on to bed. However, sleep was slow to come, for our hostel 
		companions, probably on a weekend walk or ride, insisted on talking and 
		making noise well into the night. Ted <br><br><br>27 Nuremberg July 3 D<br>
		<br><br><br>It’;s now almost 9 P.M. as<br><br>we finally get down to 
		business on the writing after finishing the usual night’s puzzle 
		balancing the bank account in our money belts. It is a beautiful evening 
		with a full moon still low in the west. We are hoping for a favorable 
		morning tomorrow for Nurnberg is packed full of those priceless little 
		scenes we photo nuts must record and early morning with its highlights 
		and shadows gives things the best touch. We are sorry that we can’t 
		bring back to you the reds, whites, and greens of the the flower filled 
		window boxes which add so much to our days on the byways.<br><br>Our 
		journey from Augsburg to Nuremberg on July 1 two days ago will not be 
		soon forgotten, and for two reasons. First is that it was the most 
		beautiful and interesting stretch of countryside we have encountered and 
		second, it was the longest day’s ride to date. We rode 150 kilometers, 
		or 100 miles. But Nurnberg called so we took up another notch in our 
		belts an went to work.<br><br>The country was great though so a few 
		extra hours pumping briskly passed quickly.<br><br>It’s now 9:26 and its 
		almost impossible to get our writing done because these German fellows 
		are so anxious to talk with us and crowd around at the slightest excuse, 
		to practice their English of course. “America” seems to be a magic word 
		and almost invariably every Gemini man or woman shopkeeper says 
		“Deutschland ist sehr shon, Ja”? (Germany is very beautiful. Yes?” to 
		which we always truthfully answer in the affirmative, putting both 
		parties at once on the best of terms. A young Czechoslovakian just came 
		over and kept us busy for a good ten minutes, as we listened to his 
		discourse on Prague and his future plans. He has been studying English 
		by himself and is making the most of opportunities to practice. We 
		greatly enjoy these little chats and only wish that lights weren’t 
		turned out here in the Jugendherberge at 10 o’clock so that both writing 
		and talking could be accomplished.<br><br>To get back to the pressing 
		issue, aft er the usual breakfast of milch, bread, and jam eaten in the 
		hostel yard while basking in the early morning sun’s warmth, we bade 
		“Aufwiedersehn” to the cheery plump father with a real Hindenburg 
		mustache, and pedaled off, loaded to the gunwales. This old fellow had a 
		real sense of humor, not found often in our German hostel experiences 
		with such officials, as he sat down at the woebegone piano and bangd out 
		Yankee Doodle Dandy with disastrous results. He gets a great kick out of 
		life and radiates his joy to the group.<br><br><br><br>Continued..Next 
		day<br><br><br><br>Today is the great 4th but it is just another day for 
		us for old man sin must have heard that we are planning to start for 
		Heidelberg this afternoon. He, or she, is liquidating in his usual 
		unappreciated manner forcing us to spend the time inside. However there 
		is much writing to do so it’s just as well. On our next trip abroad are 
		planning to start in Lapland in the dead of winter, working down slowly 
		to avoid the summer rains.<br><br>During yesterday morning, and a really 
		long one it was, for we were on the road at 8:39-think of it--we pedaled 
		over rolling country with lovely farms, old and new, and through quaint 
		tiny villages. Peasants worked in the fields, doing all the labor by 
		hand aided, perhaps, by a horse and in just one case by a tractor, the 
		first we have seen in many a day. The women always with colored 
		kerchiefs tied over their heads and usually in white, blue, red make 
		real the mental picture we have formed in America as we have imagined 
		how the other half of the world lives. Sunshine flooded everything, and 
		great white clouds hung lazily above. Roadside crucifixes are becoming 
		fewer and fewer as we ride north. In Southern Bavaria every farm had its 
		carved crucifix.<br><br>Donausworth, just 46 kilometers from Augsburg, 
		is a quaint very old town on the River Donau, and as yet has not met the 
		modern world as we pumped over its rough cobblestoned main street. This 
		is a matter unforgettable just as is the tiny grocery store we purchased 
		two apples for 30 pfennings and munched them in the shade just outside 
		of town. Already stomachs were asking for sustenance for we can’t live 
		on beauty alone in every tiny hamlet of town. Quaint barnyard scenes 
		greet our eyes, and many a time we had to pull over while ox drawn hay 
		or fertilizer carts rolled by manned by sleepy characters who seem to 
		have supreme confidence in their equally drowsy looking animals. Few 
		automobiles were met, so we enjoyed the countryside peacefulness to its 
		fullest. These Bavarian old timers are great, shuffling along slowly on 
		the road, their strange pipes swinging like pendulums from their mouths.<br>
		<br>It was only 11:30 but out tongues were hanging out with desire for 
		food as we approached Jktzing (Yo say it). But can you imagine our 
		surprise to find not a store in the town, and hardly any sign of one. We 
		had seen nothing quite like this before. It w is just a tiny hamlet of 
		quaint peasant houses, with a light blanket of dust over everything. 
		Evidently its inhabitants all were out in the fields, leaving chickens 
		and ducks in full charge. It as just packed with picturesque nooks and 
		crannies undiscovered, of course, by tourist hordes. To make the picture 
		complete, a smiling goose boy came down the narrow dusty unpaved main 
		street,driving his flock of cackling milk feathered ducks before him. 
		His plain little staff, handled deftly, kept the more rambunctious 
		elements in order. It was a scene we have seen many times in art 
		galleries, but never expected to meet in real life. I dearly hope my 
		snapshot will come out.<br><br>We simply could go no longer without food 
		so sat down by the side of the road and finished the bread and jam 
		remaining from breakfast, along with water furnished by the Jtzing 
		Public Works Administration in its town water trough. This light repast, 
		just an appetizer, held us for the remanning five kilometers to Monheim, 
		another lazy old village, hot and dusty, but for milk we had to go to 
		the village dairy high on the hill where we were served with the 
		greatest of beverages on the dairy’s steps. Satisfied at last, we lay 
		for many minutes in the roadside shade, allowing the delicacies to 
		digest.<br><br>The early afternoon passed quickly as we pedaled more 
		rapidly over a fairly level country, broken occasionally by short pulls. 
		One stretch, however, we’ll not forget, for it went up and down over 
		dusty roads that loosened everything inside our insides, while we prayed 
		for no punctures. It’s real work riding this type of cow path.<br><br>
		Wessenburg is the superest old town we have yet seen, remaining today as 
		it was in the time of Knights and Ladies. The ancient town hall still 
		stands in parts, with its four cornered towers informing tourists as 
		they approach that they are now in the heart of a land filled with musk 
		of past grandeur and pageantry. Wessenburg took to us and we to it, from 
		the moment we drank from its lovely fountain.<br><br>Time was flying and 
		Nurnberg was still more than 50 kilometers away, but we just had to 
		spend some miniutes wandering through narrow lanes and byways or across 
		the few town squares, sopping up the loveliness around us. The houses 
		were plastered, with beams and other wood work exposed in delightful 
		Symmetry. What really thrilled us were the tiny glass enclosed balconies 
		with geranium and peony filled windows. These flowers fairly spring from 
		every window and add so much beauty. And the grill work signs in 
		silhouette add the final touch, seen against the sky, as they more or 
		less frame our views.<br><br>One barnyard is vivid in our minds and 
		right in the center of town too. Through the open barnyard door we see 
		framed perfectly the sprawling Bavarian barn, hay strewn cobblestones, 
		and a rickety old grain wagon. Our camera didn’t let us down so you too 
		will see it.<br><br>We hated to leave but the minutes were flying and we 
		had tasted just enough of the old here to wish to see Nurnberg as soon 
		as possible. Ellwaggen, another grand old village passed by, and then 
		came Roth where we stopped to pay proper homage with toasts of milk and 
		confiture(snails ) carried out in proper style while answering the 
		shopkeeper’s questions between gulps. Schwabdorf was next and took us 
		down its cobblestone main street which gives these French bikes the real 
		jitters. A few kilometers more brought us into Nurnberg, the city of our 
		dreams and hopes. The usual trouble with street surfaces and our 
		confusion in trying to understand a cop’s gesticulations were combined 
		with our attempts to get directions to the Jugenherberge, the same 
		queries we experience in each new city. Again, a friendly youth came to 
		our aid, taking us to the hostel. There we showered in ice cold water, 
		slicked up, and walked a few blocks down the Konigstrasse, the main 
		street, to the Motkeller where we enjoyed a good dinner, which also 
		served to leaden the eyelids.<br><br>The Motkeller or meat cellar is one 
		of Nurenberg’s most known restaurants, situated in the cellar of one of 
		the old grain store houses used during early times to keep stocked for 
		sieges and it is usually built into the fortifications well inside the 
		moat. We were quite disappointed in the “keller” itself, finding only 
		newly painted Gothic pillars and vaulted ceiling instead of the musky 
		old hall we expected. The dinner was good and the waitress full of 
		smiles, so we enjoyed the time, even if the three tiny pears we had for 
		desert would get “the bird” in California.<br><br>All the good beds were 
		occupied in the Jugendherberge so again we forced to sleep on the low 
		cots in the attic. Being too tired to care what we slept on, we hit the 
		hay, interrupted only when rain cam through the skylight, dampening Ted 
		slightly right in the midst of a sweet dream. Rain has stopped now so we 
		will walk over to the house of Albrecht Durer, immortal pioneering 
		Nurnberg artist and noted for his engravings (etchings) to see some of 
		his works, but most important, just to see his house as he lived in 
		it..D.<br><br><br>28 July 4 Nurnberg<br><br><br><br>Ladies and gents-You 
		have just heard our “Glorious Fourth” If you have enunciated each 
		syllable with care you have received the same depth of feeling we 
		experience. I hope your ears are not burned. It is really outrageous the 
		way these Germans pass up our “4th” without even a cackle, but a 
		derby-hatted beer wagon driver cracked his whip this morning and we are 
		satisfied.<br><br><br><br>July 2nd<br><br><br><br>We were up at the 
		“crack of dawn this morning, not by our own choices, though. A large 
		group of students spent the night here and used up all their surplus 
		energy after a day of sight seeing by yelling and cutting up until 11 
		P.M., and then they started all over again at 6 AM., refreshed by their 
		few hours of sleep.<br><br>It looked like a beautiful morning so we 
		rolled out at 6 to make a photo excursion trough old Nurnberg in the 
		early morning light. But again hopes were doomed. By the time we had 
		consumed our usual allotment of milk, bread, and jam, clouds filled the 
		sky, hiding the sun, so that until 9 o’clock we just walked about the 
		cites we,followed the “Handy Guide” given us by Mr. ity as.<br><br>
		Starting at the old Kornmarket now used as a hop markt in one of the 
		really picturesque old storehouses and squares, we walked down the 
		Jaholstrasse to the Neisser Turn, or White Tower. This solid stone 
		structure was a gate in the earlier wall around the town, and it is as 
		strong today as ever, It is really a pair of entrances giving double 
		protection, surrounded by a time darkened square tower. It was as we 
		approached the gate that an under slung beer wagon rolled out of a dark 
		side street, pulled by to fine looking dray horse and manned by a 
		derby-hatted roustabout. The small kegs of precious liquid banged 
		together as the driver cracked his whip , masterly urging on his 
		straining horses.<br><br>It is great to find such a real touch of the 
		old, especially in a country where diesel trucks roar up and down the 
		highways.<br><br>It was in Nurnberg that the watch was first made, so we 
		next visited the statue of its inventor, Peter Henlein. The window panes 
		in this vicinity are of special interest, many still in place after 
		centuries of use. They resemble camera lenses with their outer convex 
		contours.<br><br>Walking down the several blocks to the river, we came 
		upon a secondhand market, or Trodmarkt, with all of its wares on outdoor 
		display, consisting mostly of shoes. Interesting prints, some perhaps 
		very old, received most of our attention. One can never tell whether 
		what one sees is a really old print, for perfect weather-beaten copies 
		are the rule these days. From the tiny bridge below we had a fine view 
		of the Henhersteg, or Hangman’s Bridge, with its characteristic tower. 
		Then we walked back though the bustling city of today, modern stores 
		housed in medieval buildings<br><br>At the Bahnhof(station) we caught 
		car number 15 to take us to Mr. Scmidt lithographing works. For half an 
		hour we enjoyed his interesting process carried out to the nth degree as 
		the leading plant in Nurnberg. In lithographing, instead of using the 
		usual type, the design is first drawn on a specially prepared stone and 
		then transferred by means of a complicated and technical process to 
		paper. In its simplest form, here is the process.<br><br>The stones are 
		quarried somewhere near Augsburg and have qualities of strength and fine 
		grain. Their surfaces are first smoothed and then polished. The designs 
		are then applied by master artists doing everything by hand. Since Mr. 
		Schmidt’s English did not encompass the more technical steps, his 
		descriptions were not always clear so that much of that is doubtful in 
		our understanding. By a special process, the use of a certain ink then 
		covered with water that is allowed to dry leads to the next step where 
		the paper is placed on the stone and pressed the designs transferred 
		without flaws. Many colors are applied, necessitating a new stone and 
		design for each as the final print emerges, such as Shell Oil covers 
		running through the presses that day. Time was short so this brief 
		introduction sufficed. It is a treat to watch these master craftsmen and 
		artists at work. It is a satisfaction to know that the machine will 
		never fully replace the human imagination and inspiration, although 
		techniques may advance.<br><br>Mr. Schmidt then put us on the street car 
		with directions to transfer to the Erlangen bus for Dr.Wintz, the Rotary 
		President was expecting us that morning at his University office. After 
		banging 20 kilometers over more cobblestones, we arrived in Erlangen and 
		walked quickly to the address given us, finding it to be clinic of the 
		University of Erlangen. Dr. Wintz’s secretary took us in her charge, 
		showing us the inside workings of the leading experimental X Ray shops 
		in the world. It was through her that we realized what a worldwide 
		medical man Dr. Wintz is, famous for his contributions to X Ray 
		development. Garbed in a doctor’s white starched coats, we watched the 
		latest in X Ray equipment in action, as machines not yet on the market 
		are tested.<br><br>The knowledge of the scientific advances here are 
		very limited we are sorry to say, but future studies in this field will 
		make things much clearer to the rest of the world.<br><br>We examined 
		each other’s beating heart in the “plate”, machine. I had the camera 
		slung on my shoulder as usual while in the treatment room. Miss Shoener 
		did not notice it until afterwards, telling us that any film in the 
		camera is ruined if it was in the room with the equipment turned on. The 
		film had not been exposed, so our only loss was financial, not half so 
		serious if our photos from the past days had been injured. We were just 
		lucky.<br><br>Dr. Wintz managed to take a few minutes from his pressing 
		day to talk with us and help plan our future journey through Germany. We 
		liked ham from the start and appreciated his interest in us and giving 
		us his valuable time.<br><br>With an invitation to take coffee in his 
		home with him at 5 o’clock, we left and Miss Shoener, Ted, and I took 
		lunch in the “garten” of the town’s leading restaurant. When we think 
		again of our dessert, our mouths water. It was a “confiture,” really a 
		strawberry short cake, whip cream and all. Only our photo of it will do 
		it justice.<br><br>In order to allow digestive processes to catch up, we 
		walked about town, listening to our genial guide’s enthusiastic tales ot 
		Erlangen, for centuries famous for its Mintz, or Makers of Coins. 
		However, this lucrative business was stopped during a certain period of 
		100 years or so by the government at the instigation of nearby Nurnberg, 
		jealous of the smaller city’s power.<br><br>Dr. Wintz’s hobby is old 
		coins and he has written a book of note on the history of Erlangen 
		coins? How has he found time to carry on this hobby to such perfection 
		is a mystery, adding only a little more to our admiration for his 
		achievements.<br><br>The French influence is strongly felt in Erlangen 
		as one sees a few remaining one-story houses of French design, and the 
		main square Protestant church built by the French Huegenots in their 
		migration to Germany at the scrapping of the Nantes Edict. Ted and I 
		wonder if some of our Huegenot ancestors included Erlangen on their 
		eventual way to America.<br><br>Dr. Wintz’s work with is fully 
		appreciated by Siemans, the world’s leading manufacturer as well as 
		developer of this equipment. They keep the Doctor supplied with the 
		latest in development so that he can test and criticize.<br><br>Because 
		the plant is in Erlangen, Dr. Wintz secured permission for us to visit 
		it, a privilege granted to only a few of our level of technical 
		ignorance. There we saw the world’s finest X Ray machines in the making, 
		described to us by Dr, King, a young Englishman who is working there in 
		order to know the products he will be selling in England. The mechanical 
		side was all very interesting, but seeing the men at work and observing 
		their working conditions brought us the most satisfaction.<br><br>Uncle 
		Bert might be interested to know that the Siemans’ latest development is 
		the portable X Ray apparatus and is a chromium sheathed bell almost 12 
		inches in diameter. The biggest demand right now is for their ultra 
		short-wave machine, easily the finest in the world.<br><br>Dr. King’s 
		comments on the factory and men were most interesting. An aim of the 
		Hitler government is to improve the workers’ conditions, thus combatting 
		communism, Factories must make certain improvements, as Siemans is 
		doing, in building recreation fields, improving shop environments, and 
		constructing up to date eating halls. Drinking beer, however, seems to 
		be the main recreation for the working men, as they build portly 
		stomachs to fill their leather shorts and thus keep them from dropping, 
		as do ours without the hosentrager in place. Pay runs about 150 Marks 
		with 180 as the maximum, about $70 at the present exchange rate. 
		Government taxes which are applied before the wage is passed on to the 
		worker, are terribly high, accounting for the lower pay. The men are 
		really making close to nothing, as they spend anything left over for 
		beer. Mr. King enjoys working with the Bavarians for he finds them fine 
		work mates.<br><br>A goodly number of women are employed and a large 
		number of boys around 14 are completing apprenticeships of six years, 
		preparatory to specialty work. The whole two hours we spent there were 
		filled with information, for their engineers are unsurpassed in 
		initiative and ingenuity. However, from our experiences with bike 
		breakdowns, and there have been plenty of these, we are sure that the 
		least informed and most uncreative Germans are in the bike business. 
		They know only their German makes of bikes and lack the insight and 
		experience to figure out our French contraptions. It was pure comedy the 
		other day to watch one man putting my brake on backwards time and time 
		again, even though I tried to show him the right way. In the end I did 
		all of the work using his tools while he gave up in disgust. My German 
		vocabulary did not include his under the breath mutterings.<br><br>Five 
		o’clock found us in Dr.Wintz’s ultra modern home, situated ideally on 
		the heights above town. He has several acres and in the center is his 
		house, designed primarily by the Doctor himself, to house his valuable 
		art collection. Coffee was super, but those German short cakes hit the 
		spot, served in a most unusual dining room as Indirect lighting give 
		just the right effects on old religious carvings fit perfectly in panels 
		in the dark polished woodwork walls. After this delightful repast, we 
		spent a good many minutes admiring the collection of old coins, even 
		weighty Roman ones green with age. As a remembrance of our visit to 
		Erlangen, Dr. Wintz presented to each of us a German coin, their faces 
		worn but still showing their mint dates, 1609 and 1604. We will treasure 
		these not for their worth but as a reminder of our warm Erlangen friend 
		and the few wonderful hours in his company.<br><br>As “privileged 
		plutocrats” for the first time in many a day we were driven back to 
		Nurnberg in the Doctor’s slick Packard touring car manned by his 
		chauffeur in green livery. With our noses high gave only passing glances 
		and made bored comments about the bicyclers we were passing, leaving 
		them in the dust. We made the 29 kilometer run in real style.<br><br>
		With rough cobblestones once again under foot in Adolph Hitler Platz we 
		were reminded that we are still staying at the Jugendherberge and not at 
		the Hotel Castoria, and that only a few minutes of daylight remained, so 
		we hurried to a few chosen spots taking some snaps while just a glimmer 
		of sunshine persisted.<br><br>Ice cream and confiture filled supper’s 
		requirements before we returned to the hostel and tried to do a little 
		writing before bed. This business of trying to write in the 
		Jugendherberge is some experience, the people are so good nattered and 
		they must talk with us, sometimes in English and also in Deutsch. We sat 
		down to write (”Zuschreiben”) this evening at 7 and finally completed 
		our first paragraphs at 7:30. The group around us seemed satisfied for 
		the moment. These folks here at ‘Bailsheim Jugndherberge” are really 
		super, though. The jugendherberge “Mudder’ has just brought us a pitcher 
		of steaming hot tea and asks us to send you, Mother, their greetings. 
		The Father is keen too, a school teacher who speaks English well and was 
		planning to show us the town tonight, but it rained, of course. We 
		simply can’t help liking these people as will you someday.<br><br>If a 
		few Deutsch words slip into our writing you can ascribe them to herberge 
		mother’s enthusiasm as she tries to make us understand her German 
		comments explained regularly in my left ear. I think I had better give 
		this up as a hopeless job, for this motionless pencil can’t possibly 
		compete with my host’s good nattered outbursts.<br><br>An orchid to you 
		if you are still awake. After China and Japan these letters must be 
		terribly dull. Every time lightening flashes, the lights dim and we hold 
		our breaths hoping they won’t keep us in the dark, We are still planning 
		to be in England about the 10th of August. Dick<br><br><br>29 Crailsheim 
		July 5 <br><br><br><br>What a glorious feeling it was this morning as 
		the early sun woke us up. No clouds, just beauty. As Dick went out to 
		look for photos I hunted up a liter of milk in the store nearby. The 
		horse drawn milk wagon had just left. so the milk was fresh and 
		unusually good. With it we enjoyed bread and jam from the previous day. 
		Dick had a puncture. among other troubles, all of which took time but 
		about 9 we got started. The valley where our hostel lies is truly 
		beautiful, and even more so in the happiness-giving sunshine. From one 
		spot along the river bed, we discovered an intriguing picture. The steam 
		formed the center fore ground; an ancient bridge held the center; and 
		above, rising from the ridge and the level of the town was a round stone 
		tower, perfectly framed by the green trees along the river bank<br><br>
		Up in Rothenburg we found some good pictures. It was vastly different 
		from the Sunday afternoon before when the tourist hordes were loose. Our 
		advice is to see such places on Monday, for then the inhabitants are 
		busy about their work, and the chance to see normal town life is 
		possible. Surroundings are of course picturesque, though we are tired of 
		that descriptive word. Can’t we do better?<br><br>The place looked as 
		though it might have been a monastery, with a fountain where pigeons 
		were bathing. The wooden staircase leading to the battlements spoke for 
		itself. As we walked though the cobbled streets lined with unusual 
		houses from every century, we gained a new impression, and were sorry to 
		see the watchful guard towers disappear as we rode on to Dinkulspiel.<br>
		<br>That short trip was a joy. We are sorry that nothing we can say will 
		do the countryside justice. Sheep raising is important here, though not 
		on the huge American scale. Forests cover much of the land and grain 
		fields are abundant, while vegetable plots appear here and there. Along 
		the road we pass hay wagons and lumber carts, not to mention the half 
		pint autos that fly by as we look down from our high seats and eat their 
		dust.<br><br>Into Dinkulspiel we coasted through the northeast entrance 
		tower, and there on a municipal building we found a map locating the 
		Jugendherberge. Once signed in,<br><br>we washed up and went out to dig 
		up food, our first procedure wherever we go. Milk, bread, marmalada, and 
		bologna taste good as we ate in the shade. Our surroundings were 
		picturesque, and can’t we come up with better descriptive words? The 
		place looked as though it might have been a monastery, wish its fountain 
		now dedicated to pigeons and their bathing. Apparently it is a State 
		Home for old people who sit around contentedly.<br><br>After lunch we 
		started out to see the town. The “Hand Me Down” said to be sure to walk 
		around the town outside the wall, so we started. It was one of the 
		loveliest walks we have taken in many a day. The vine covered towers 
		were in two styles . One tower was round with a tapering tile roof, and 
		the other was square but both of the same size. The sturdy wall extended 
		between the towers and around the town. In these towers were doors and 
		windows for they had become homes of peasants, and outside, at certain 
		points, there were extensive vegetable gardens, no longer requiring 
		protection by a now unused moat. What marvelous photographic 
		opportunities. One such was a large quiet pond. or perhaps a small lake, 
		and mirrored in the water with sky and clouds behind, was a corner tower 
		with shaded wall. As if this was not complete enough, a swan glided by 
		to make all absolutely perfect.<br><br>As we were walking just inside 
		the wall and seeing the city from above, one of us spied two storks 
		perched in their nest on the top of the tallest chimney. We wondered 
		what would happen if a fire were started below. It was fascinating to 
		see the storks strutting and cleaning themselves. At last we have seen 
		the site where babies really come from.<br><br>From here we got down to 
		business in seeing Dinkulspiel. I have many impressions in my mind, but 
		unlike most, these cobblestones were really worn, making it hard to ride 
		on. And what is characteristic of all the places we have been is the 
		disorganized pattern of the streets. But that is better for the 
		photographic eye, for the eye does not wander into the distance but 
		tends to examine what is close by. Alternately placed around town are 
		the fountains where we so often stopped to drink. It was hot and 
		everyone was taking their time about their business.<br><br>How 
		different appearances seem to be from the Sunday before. Now the 
		inhabitants were about their work and paying little attention to the few 
		visitors, a goodly number of them Americans. The women in black with a 
		cloth over their heads were like those we had seen working the fields. 
		While we stood in the center of town, two wagons passed one another, and 
		one mischievous horse took a big hunk of hay from the passing vehicle. 
		The driver looked round just in time to see the two horse team dividing 
		the spoils. We laughed heartily.<br><br>Unlike nearby Rothenburg, we 
		found quite a bit of industry, mattress making, wooden shoe 
		manufacturing, blacksmithing and other small interests make this a true 
		working town, not relying on tourists.<br><br>That short trip was a joy.

		<br>A LOST Page it. 31. Heidelberg July 8 D<br><br>I know it is 
		difficult to amass all of your strength as you lie beneath a Diablo sun, 
		basking at the lake’s side, but here is some more dope from your “bike 
		bums”. We are sitting at one of the small tables in the Jugendherberge 
		yard at Heidelberg. The evening is super, and we are enjoying every 
		breath. Clouds still come in from the south and telling of more rain, we 
		fear. We’re far from saturated yet, but are desperately hoping for 
		sunshine on the Rhine.<br><br>A troop of marching girls just assembled 
		outside the hostel and have marched off, singing lustily. Their uniforms 
		are simple-a black shirt and white middy and a black tie. Almost all 
		have a braid of hair hanging over each shoulder. This evening’s marching 
		seems to be a regular function in the “Hitler Youth Program”..<br><br>We 
		were feeling sort of low this morning, a result of the many strenuous 
		days and trying hours in the rain, we think, so we left Heilbronn early 
		to ride as far as possible in the refreshing morning air, arriving here 
		about noon, tired and hungry. The trip was not uneventful for rain 
		managed to get its usual licks in, making things tough for a good many 
		kilometers. Before and after the downpours, however, we enjoyed the 
		country to the fullest as we meandered along and with the Nechar River. 
		We are for sure in the wine country. Vineyards cover every hillside and 
		“Weinstube” appears as frequently as “Bierkeller” in Munich.<br><br>Our 
		river side road took us through many a quaint old village where the 
		highway narrowed to an alleyway width and rough cobblestones knocked 
		everything loose. We expect that the rear ends of our bikes will drop 
		off any day as we bounce about. So far, mine takes the cake. Pedals, 
		seats, and gears have all bitten the dust, due to the rain that gets 
		into everything, making mince meat out of ball bearings. Pictruesque 
		castle walls and towers come in to view every now and then, telling us 
		that we are for sure in the Rhine country.<br><br>The Nechar is a scene 
		of constant water traffic, its numberless ultramodern locks opening and 
		closing for tugs and their barges. It was just beyond one of these 
		engineering systems that rain loosed its wrath upon us, forcing us to 
		seek shelter in a roadside Gasthaus where we sipped bottled “Fizz water” 
		lemonade to refresh nerves and feelings. From there on we limped in a 
		constant drizzle to Heidelberg, for my bike simply loses all interest in 
		life when the chain is soaked Straight for the American Express we 
		headed and there joyfully found packets of letters waiting , forwarded 
		from Berlin. It took exactly a cool one hour and a half to eat lunch 
		across the street swallowing whole your welcome ureters, including one 
		from Bob Undrwood and a card from Wins and Sue Henshaw, both written in 
		a San Francisco cafe.<br><br>The Jugendherberge was promptly found, that 
		unusual, in the opposite side of town from where we entered, that 
		unusual. Our process for locating the hostel is this. We simply ask any 
		likely looking individual, and then strain to understand the rapid fire 
		orations. Eventually we get there.<br><br>It’s a great life if you don’t 
		weaken so we keep our strength up with that pasture champagne, milk, 
		milk, and more milk. Please ask Elizabeth to have the frigidaire full of 
		applesauce and milk waiting for us soon...D . 31....Stahleck Castle ..D<br>
		<br><br><br>It’s now almost 5 PM as we write here in the Kropsach Room 
		of the finest youth hostel in Germany. Once badly demolished at the 
		hands of French invaders, Stahleck Castle has been rebuilt expressly as 
		a hostel in modern style, a fine sense of harmony being preserved 
		between the old and the new. It is located high on a bluff and commands 
		an impressive view of the Rhine, its sloping banks covered with a patch 
		work of vineyards. The black slate roofs of Bachrach are directly below 
		as are the Gothic ruins of an 18th century chapel, while up the valley 
		to the rear vineyards stretch as far as the eye can see.<br><br>This day 
		has been very uncertain, as sunshine and rain competed. However, a north 
		wind is blowing for the first time in many an eon, so we have high hopes 
		for good weather ahead. As things look now we will take the train to 
		somewhere near Almelo. Holland, forced to by the distance of almost 300 
		kilometers and by lack of time. We hope to hear from Mr. Bruening in 
		Cologne as to future plans, but now to get on to present pressing 
		business.<br><br><br><br>Heidelberg, July 9<br><br><br><br>The morning 
		dawned dull and rainy as usual, so after a breakfast of milk, jam, and 
		too many “brotehen”, we spent the time writing, making the most of the 
		impossible weather. Ted had picked up a bad cold which settled in his 
		head, and was far from feeling top notch. Since scribbling does not 
		produce a great appetite, a bowl of soup and milk sufficed for lunch at 
		the hostel, after which we started out to see the sights, taking 
		advantage of spasmodic showers and sunshine. Business came first. Ted’s 
		black shoes had lost complete interest in life, but you would too if you 
		had been stepped on for two yes, and the ”shuh” man said that they were 
		irreparable, so we purchased new ones to keep the Lyon caravan on the 
		move.<br><br>We then walked up the Hauptstrasse and passed many student 
		taverns so dark and cozy, their ceilings hung with decorative horns such 
		as were used for drinking in :”the good old days” at the University, 
		internationally famous not only as the oldest university in Germany, but 
		as the leading institution of the world for the studies of medicine and 
		chemistry. Its one main old administration building consumed our 
		interest, its “student prison”: taking first prize. It seems that many 
		years ago students who ran afoul of the law were locked up in these five 
		or six rooms for various lengths of time according to the seriousness of 
		their offenses. Their fare was supposedly bread and water, but friends 
		brought them delicacies in honor of their escapades. The center of life 
		seemed to radiate from this “heir heaven”. Everyone wished to be 
		arrested at least once so that they could write their names and leave 
		their photographs on the walls. You weren’t “one of them” unless your 
		name could be found on the wall or ceiling, all in bright colors and 
		illustrated with a candle smoke silhouette or photograph framed in wax. 
		Many famous names are thus preserved, put there by youthful violators, 
		and now are held in reverence. A few Americans managed to get their 
		“John Henrys” there, of course, along with those of other nationalities. 
		Inscriptions cover the place including one from Virgil, with that 
		gentleman’s name placed beneath. The prize boner of the day came when a 
		portly American lady in our group expressed great surprise that Virgil 
		could have been imprisoned in this very cell.<br><br>The University 
		assembly hall was impressive for its deceptions, including memorials to 
		the founders, Elector Ruptecht I and Carl Friedrich, giving the college 
		its name of “Rupeto--SCarlo”. Plaques bearing noted Heidelberg 
		professors’ names including that of Bunsen of “burner” fame, gave the 
		room a real historic flavor.<br><br>At the University office, we secured 
		John Lyman and Bill Lang’s addresses and then called on them. No such 
		person as Lang lived at the address given, and Lyman was not home, so we 
		headed for the Castle of Heidelberg to see it while chances for sunshine 
		were still good.<br><br>The Friederichsbau or Castle of Heidelbrg is 
		situated on a spur of the Konigstuhl just above the town and commanding 
		a fine view of the Nechar Valley as it stretches out to meet the Rhine 
		at Mannheim. Grounds are well laid out and beautifully kept, a super 
		setting for an evening promenade. The castle was built in 1601, 
		destroyed by the French, and partially restored of late. Its grand old 
		gate and crumbling walls interested us, especially one big piece of 
		fortification which had broken off and lay covered with moss and vines 
		in the foliage-filled moat. The court yard in Italian design of the 
		Renascence seemed strangely lonely, decorated with many staues and 
		standing silhouetted against a black sky, the building’s interior having 
		been entirely destroyed by fire. Preparations were in progress for the 
		annual festival starting on July18th to be held in the castle courtyard.<br>
		<br>Middle age plays are presented there with all the necessary 
		pageantry, and workmen were busy painting stage settings and costumes.<br>
		<br>Of the most interest to the the Lyon brothers was the great cask or 
		“Heidelberg Tun”, largest wine barrel in the world. In fact it is so 
		massive that a small dance floor has been constructed on top, with 
		plenty of room for the orchestra inside. Its cellar room is built 
		especially for it, and I’ll bet that it would have some grand stories to 
		tell if its dust coated top could speak.<br><br>Retuning to the 
		Jugendherberge for a good night’ sleep we stopped for a moment to look a 
		a sticking monument, telling of war and strife like so many we have seen 
		throughout our journey in Germany.<br><br>The German eagle stands on a 
		marble pedestal on which is cut “Saar”. A broken chain hangs down, the 
		other end fastened to an iron ball resting on the pavement. This 
		represents the the recent reunion of “Saar” to Germany, referring to 
		Alsace Lorraine, their chains to France having been broken. We find this 
		spirit of hatred and desire for return of pre-war holdings kept alive in 
		the youths everywhere in such monuments and wall inscriptions, even in 
		the Jugendherberges.<br><br>America has arrived in Germany. We see more 
		Americans every day, including many boys in the hostel. Two brothers 
		from River Forest, Illinois are pedaling a tandem through here, and they 
		complained that they had not yet found a barber shop in Germany. This 
		struck us as awfully funny because streets are lined with “Friseurs” 
		barber signs, their shining silver and gold letters always proclaiming 
		their trade.<br><br>Dinner calls and I must hurry and close. Ted is 
		screaming for sustenance. Your birthday cake was good Mom. Hope you take 
		an extra piece of angel food for each of us D<br><br><br>30.... 
		Heilbronn July 7 D<br><br>It is just past 6 o'clock as we sit here in 
		the Jugendherberge yard, penning our experiences and impressions. This 
		day has been really hot, so hat the sultry air, even here in the shade, 
		keeps us perspiring. A large group of boys and girls has just come in, 
		seating themselves here at this long table. All of the boys are about 13 
		years old and are dressed alike, including “Sing Sing “ haircuts-real 
		sons of the soil. The girls with braided hair resting on their shoulder 
		are equally as ruddy and hardy. We think that they are probably a group 
		of orphans out for a few day’s trip.<br><br>As we ride through the 
		country or mix with the youths in the evening, and observe their lives 
		and habits, we can’t help offering silent prayers of thankfulness for 
		our living in the grandest country on earth, where freedom and peace go 
		hand in hand. Seeing these kids eating their evening meals of brown 
		bread and doubtfully fresh milk make us appreciate even more the 
		grandest little fireside on earth.<br><br>American boys are truly the 
		luckiest in the world, and I know of no two who will more fully 
		appreciate our “land of youth and freedom, beyond the ocean bars” after 
		seeing how the other half of the world lives, where “freedom” is not a 
		word to be even thought about.<br><br><br><br>July 8th,<br><br><br><br>
		Starting out like a lion and ending up like a lamb. In other words, rain 
		soaked us all morning and then sunshine made life worth living again in 
		the afternoon.<br><br>The least said about the morning’s ride from 
		Nurnberg to Ansbach, the better. We awakened, of course always hoping 
		for a fine day, only to find a drizzle keeping everyone in a constant 
		state of dampness. Luck seems to have been against us until now as far a 
		photography is concerned, Nurnberg sadly included. We had to have some 
		remembrances of that grand city, so we took a few snaps in the rain 
		before leaving. All of the way the rain beat against our faces, letting 
		up a little now and then, but with a torrential; climax, soaking shoes 
		and socks, just as Ansbach came into view. Trouble with my bike chain 
		again, due to my junky set of gears, added to the already trying 
		conditions. Rain surely puts a cramp into things, but oh how it makes us 
		appreciate a little sunshine. One tiny roadside church reminded us of 
		our super one in Piedmont. We’ve visited Japanese temples, Italian 
		basilicas, and German Cathedrals but we’ll take the Piedmont Community 
		Church any day.<br><br>Lunch was good in the small town Gasthof as we 
		managed to swallow a mouthful every now and then between questions from 
		the usual number of “beer barons” always found in such places.<br><br>
		The sun was shining as we struck out again, our stock in the world 
		soaring to new heights. Ansbach to Rothernburg, just 34 kilometers was 
		such a pleasant ride. Our road took us through tiny dusty towns every 
		few minutes, streets lined with aged wooden pumps, their long handles 
		propelled energetically by country maidens, their arms strong from years 
		of such exercises. Of special interest were the house front decorations, 
		trees trained right against the plaster in the fanciest of designs, 
		shutters hung at all angles and in all stages of disrepair. If busses 
		filled with Sunday sightseers didn’t roar down the town’s one and only 
		main street, I’m sure everyone would be sound asleep, lulled away in 
		this drowsy atmosphere.<br><br>Our first view of Rothenburg’s walls and 
		spires came as we crossed a heavily wooded hill some five kilometers 
		away. Anticipation put wings on our heels, sending us easily up the 
		grade to the town.<br><br>To find the Jugendherberge and clean up was an 
		absolute necessity in order that we might view this historical town in 
		the most receptive mood, so we noticed nothing while inquiring the way, 
		although our first view of the grand old gate, as we wobbled beneath its 
		arch over the cobblestones is one of our most pleasant memories.<br><br>
		My tire went flat just as we reached the main platz so that a long walk 
		was my lot to the hostel which we dissevered finally to be by the River 
		Tauber winding its way well below the town. As it turned out the hostel 
		location was quite wonderful on the river’s edge and in the shade of 
		evergreen trees. Its porch opened out on a lovely garden and there we 
		ate our dinner, drinking in the peacefulness pervading everything in 
		these quiet Bavarian countryside's, An old waterwheel with only a few of 
		its spokes remaining to tell its story is covered with moss and not a 
		few tin cans. Beds were long and comfortable for our footage and with 
		such a superb location, Rothenburg’s Jugendherberge went to the top of 
		our list.<br><br>Once more aright with the world as we cleaned up, we 
		hiked up the steep valley side path to see what surprises were in store 
		for us in this most famous of preserved “middle age” towns.<br><br>
		”Rothenburg Aub Tauber” is laid out along the edge of a plateau dropping 
		abruptly to the River Tauber, which winds below in great serpentine 
		coils. Well preserved walls and towers and battlements rise forbiddingly 
		above the precipitous valley side and surround the town completely, 
		telling glorious stories of the past. Practically invulnerable to attack 
		on the river side, the city must have experienced some thrilling times 
		along the plateau ramparts.<br><br>(Heidelberg)<br><br>We are now 
		inside. A terrific wind is bringing clouds and rain with the speed of an 
		army attack. Hope the tank runs dry before long. People are running 
		every which way, trying to find shelter before everything cuts loose. 
		Ah-summer in sunny Gemany!<br><br><br><br>Back to Rothennburg<br><br>
		<br><br>Rough roadways of cobblestones rounded with wear and thus jolts 
		announce to the visitor that he is living not now but in a town 500 
		years ago, and a quaint one it has become. Once through the double 
		arched gate dominated by a massive stone tower unchanged through the 
		centuries, one finds himself in a tiny world unlike anything seen 
		before. Narrow byways extend right and left along the towering wall’s 
		inner sides, made even narrower by piles of wood and faggots stacked 
		high against the solid rampart. Rickety battle galleries of weather 
		beaten timber surmount the walls with loopholes for cumbersome muskets 
		and deadly cross bows, all framing a lovely countryside for one who 
		wishes to clamber up.<br><br>Once inside the town we completely forgot 
		such things as guides to tell us what to see and why. Rothenburg is 
		truly a topsy-turvy town, for houses lean and sag in every direction. 
		One would wonder if he had exceeded his limit with the last beer, as he 
		stands and surveys the the tipsy array. High swooping roofs of thin 
		tiles are a convention in this medieval village, with lovely gabled 
		houses to be found in every square. Timber designs on the upper 
		exteriors are covered partially by clinging vines, with flower boxes in 
		every window filled with bright, cheery geraniums and peonies, and with 
		wise old faces gazing placidly from their flowered bowers at the never 
		ending passing show below give Rothenburg an irresistible appeal and 
		flavor. Flowers wreath the fountains that are found in the grand 
		Platzes’ completely enclosed with “roofy” old structures housing a 
		Gasthaus and modern millinery shops , each with its own shining 
		grillwork sign suspended over the street.<br><br>Butchers, bakers, and 
		broom stick makers walk lazily about in modern dress, but the past is 
		far from forgotten, for if one is patient he is sure to see a peasant 
		woman marketing in rustic dress of black , ankle length, and head 
		protected from the blistering sun by a three cornered bandanna tied in a 
		consistent style . Rattling hay wagons rumble continually over the aged 
		street with colossal loads that barely scrape under and through gateway 
		arches, as peasant women in working attire with white head coverings 
		expertly control the swaying blubbering oxen-tractors of old Germany. 
		Streets shoot perilously this way and that in the town’s lower reaches. 
		each one filled with some bit of life found only n in byways steeped 
		with age and color. Peeping through gateway cracks on almost any street 
		one finds the quaintest of miniature barnyards filled with chickens 
		strutting over the ever present pile of manure, above which sag barn 
		roofs and walls.<br><br>If one is interested in Rothenburg from the 
		historical viewpoint, he will be amply rewarded by a visit to the 
		Rathaus, steeped in drama and pageantry, for it was there that momentous 
		decisions were made during the “Thirty Years War”. A magnificent 
		Cathedral should satisfy fully the church lover, remodeled in the strict 
		Gothic of its earliest years. Nearby is a lovely old “oriel window”, its 
		window panes of early rough glass supported with lead molding. It was in 
		these protruding corner glass enclosed balconies that the village 
		gossips could watch three streets at once by merely turning their heads.<br>
		<br>There is much more to tell about medieval Rothernburg, for one can 
		wander about for days, stumbling on something new with every turn. Our 
		few short hours simply unfolded to us the most common of secrets which 
		any traveler may find with little exertion. What lies behind those 
		flower garlanded house fronts must be left until another time when we 
		can snoop about with that genuine photographer’s<br><br>cursedness which 
		only develops through experience.<br><br>These is just a brief survey of 
		a grand old town described as we saw it on a Monday morning at an hour 
		too early for the tourist hordes. Unfortunately, arriving on Sunday as 
		we did, we found the town burdened with sightseers loaded to the hilts 
		with cameras and tripods, so useless in a crowd. Busses loaded to 
		capacity roared in and our all of the time. Our first impressions of 
		Rothernburg in the press of humanity were disappointing as you would 
		imagine, but how wonderful it wa early the next morning with not a 
		tourist in sight and inhabitants going about their work just as has been 
		done for centuries, with a few modern improvements of course.<br><br>
		Evening in the Jugendherberge was grand. After a homemade supper we 
		hiked to the summit of the hill opposite the town and enjoyed a gorgeous 
		sunset as it tinted Rothenburg’s roofs with gold. The Cathedral 
		dominated everything as in all of these villages and from our point of 
		view, houses are dwarfed by the edifices’ spires. While sitting on the 
		hostel balcony we managed to write a little before going to bed, taking 
		time out to admire the old bridge in the evening light as it spans the 
		Tauber. A few yards away, kartoffle and wurst (potatoes and weenie) are 
		getting cold so I must close, and eat...(Completed in Heidelberg) 
		31....Stahleck Castle ..D<br><br><br><br>It’s now almost 5 PM as we 
		write here in the Kropsach Room of the finest youth hostel in Germany. 
		Once badly demolished at the hands of French invaders, Stahleck Castle 
		has been rebuilt expressly as a hostel in modern style, a fine sense of 
		harmony being preserved between the old and the new. It is located high 
		on a bluff and commands an impressive view of the Rhine, its sloping 
		banks covered with a patch work of vineyards. The black slate roofs of 
		Bachrach are directly below as are the Gothic ruins of an 18th century 
		chapel, while up the valley to the rear vineyards stretch as far as the 
		eye can see.<br><br>This day has been very uncertain, as sunshine and 
		rain competed. However, a north wind is blowing for the first time in 
		many an eon, so we have high hopes for good weather ahead. As things 
		look now we will take the train to somewhere near Almelo. Holland, 
		forced to by the distance of almost 300 kilometers and by lack of time. 
		We hope to hear from Mr. Bruening in Cologne as to future plans, but now 
		to get on to present pressing business.<br><br><br><br>Heidelberg, July 
		9<br><br><br><br>The morning dawned dull and rainy as usual, so after a

		with those of other nationalities. Inscriptions cover the place 
		including one from Virgil, with that gentleman’s name placed beneath. 
		The prize boner of the day came when a portly American lady in our group 
		expressed great surprise that Virgil could have been imprisoned in this 
		very cell.<br><br>The University assembly hall was impressive for its

		and Lyman was not home, so we headed for the Castle of Heidelberg to see

		inscriptions, even in the Jugendherberges.<br><br>America has arrived in 
		Germany. We see more Americans every day, including many boys in the 
		hostel. Two brothers from River Forest, Illinois are pedaling a tandem 
		through here, and they complained that they had not yet found a barber 
		shop in Germany. This struck us as awfully funny because streets are 
		lined with “Friseurs” barber signs, their shining silver and gold 
		letters always proclaiming their trade.<br><br>Dinner calls and I must 
		hurry and close. Ted is screaming for sustenance. Your birthday cake was 
		good Mom. Hope you take an extra piece of angel food for each of us D<br>
		<br><br>32 Bachrach July 11 T<br><br><br><br>Yesterday was Mother’s 
		birthday and you are in our hearts with wishes for a happy one. To 
		celebrate the day we bought a small chocolate frosted cake and took it 
		with us into the Ratskeller last night for dinner. The Ratskeller in 
		Mainz is not large, just plain and with a pleasant atmosphere. The beer 
		was not good, but the food excellent and the lady in charge the same. 
		And after the meal we called for knives and plates for the cake, but 
		before she could fetch the plates the cake was almost finished. We 
		carved into the chocolate, “Happy Birthday Mother”, but unfortunately 
		there were no candles. We didn’t finish the celebration, however, but 
		walked to an ice cream shop and enjoyed the rest in real style. Today 
		we’ve been feeling the effects of that rich indulgence, but if Mother 
		enjoyed this birthday that is all that counts Have many more please.<br>
		<br>In Heidelbgerg where we were two nights ago at the hostel, we were 
		anxious to contact either John Lyman or Bill Lang from Stanford. Unable 
		to find Lang we left a note at Lyman’s place and awaited results. 
		Nothing turned up until yesterday morning. . As we finished breakfast, 
		and were preparing to leave, John showed up. It was good to see him 
		again. Although he is Zete but always lived in Encina Hall as the head 
		counselor, I had met him at Stanford, yet I knew little of him, but he 
		and Dick began slinging it right away.<br><br>It is too bad that the 
		Olympic officials deemed it necessary for him to return to the States in 
		order to try out. He feels it isn’t worth it although he’d be a cinch 
		for the shot-put. Well, he invited us for breakfast, our second, and we 
		accepted. He uses a bicycle all of the time going to and from the 
		chemistry lab where he works. John has an excellent location, a small 
		room and he says it’s the best in Heidelberg. He is living with a family 
		at home. We fully enjoyed our second breakfast of coffee, bread, jam, 
		and fruit. He gave us a few tips on eating, for we’ve been consuming a 
		lot of cheap bread and no butter, a bad idea. From now on we will watch 
		our menu more carefully. It was interesting to talk with our host, 
		swapping opinions and exchanging notes from home.<br><br>He told us of a 
		duel he saw where instead of using the long blades, the fighters used 
		wide blades of an entirely different style. Both duelists were well 
		covered up, except for hands and heads. The same was true for each 
		second standing behind the duelist. The antagonists may hack or strike 
		at each other four times in a round, at the end of which the seconds 
		step in and halt things. There are about sixty of these rounds in the 
		fight John saw, so it is long and time passes slowly. The boys get a bit 
		cut up on hands and faces, but those scars seem to be the last word in 
		good looks good over here. John told us that we have just missed the 
		cherry season and it is still too early for grapes. What luck!<br><br>He 
		says there is very little student life, so romanticized in the past. Of 
		course he drinks beer and wine with the boys in the inns around town.<br>
		<br>After a good hour’s visit we had to be moving on, so he escorted us 
		a short distance, with an “Aufwiedersehn” as we left Heidelberg<br><br>
		Our first view of the Rhine was had at the bridge at Mannheim. There it 
		is just a big river with small steam tugs working upstream, but it was a 
		bit of a thrill to us after all the days we have been riding toward it, 
		We were starting into the wine country and wine houses increased as did 
		vineyards<br><br>Tomato and other vegetable plots with orchards of 
		cherry and apple trees covered every inch of ground. We had lunch of 
		milk and bread and a couple of oranges at Worms and moved on. We notice 
		the towns becoming more plain and modern. From Worms to Mainz the river 
		meanders down a wide green valley. Golden grain fields offer a contrast, 
		willows and poplars along the banks, and silvery clouds pass along 
		behind, always moving from south to north. It makes for unusually fine 
		pictures when a steam tug chugs up the river in the foreground.<br><br>
		We reached Mainz at 5 o’clock and found a room in a shabby Gasthaus, we 
		e determined to get at least one good night’s sleep in peace and quiet. 
		The beds were long and looked comfortable and we could not ask for 
		anything more. After cleaning up we hiked into he city. Mainz is the 
		capital of the Province of Rheinhessen, with 100,000 inhabitants. It is 
		the center of the wine trade. It is also important industrially. We 
		first went to the old market where numerous patrician houses stand, and 
		then walked to the State Theater near which is the statue of Gutenberg. 
		As we walked we realized that this is a very large city Usually the 
		highway leads us into the center of a town, and if one wants to see the 
		sights he must go off the beaten track. Here fine stores surrounded us 
		no matter where we stood. We find the backeral windows enticing all of 
		the time, just as the ice cream improves all of the time. After failing 
		to find a means of entering the Cathedral, we looked for dinner and 
		found it in the Rathskeller, there to fete Mom’s birthday.<br><br>While 
		in Mainz we became more aware of the military atmosphere. These people 
		over here really mean business. From a<br><br>bystander’s position it is 
		all very interesting and perhaps disturbing<br><br>Back to the Gastof 
		and comfortable beds, although only a feather quilt covered us. Washing 
		in cold water in the basin isn’t very good but if our clothes can take 
		it so can we. Ted<br><br><br>34 Bad Godesberg July 12 D<br><br><br><br>
		Our stay at Stahleck Castle Youth Hostel was a real treat. After one of 
		the best night’s sleep in many a day, I was softly awakened this morning 
		by the soft strains of music, evidently a radio or recording in the 
		office. They are very strict in these hostels that way. Breakfast 
		consisted of milk, bread, and jam. The hostel father showed us around 
		the castle in a group.<br><br>just as we were leaving and all packed up 
		it started to rain. We ducked into a shelter until things let up, and 
		then started off down the Rhein. We soon left Bachrach and its castle 
		and towers behind and were pushing over the cobblestones and with 
		special scenery everywhere. The castles are so situated that as one 
		disappears behind, another shows up ahead. They are picturesque with 
		battlements and a Nazi flag flying from the topmost parapet, sometimes 
		silhouetted in the or against the green background of a vineyard wish we 
		could have inspected each one in turn. but instead had to picked out 
		one, the Stolzenfels Castle near Coblenz, just to give us an idea of 
		what we re missing.<br><br>It started to rain again bout noon, so we 
		hurried back to a small town for the usual lunch of warm milk, bread, 
		jam, pastry and ice cream. The strawberry ice cream seems best in this 
		neck of the woods.<br><br>About three o’clock we reached the entrance to 
		Stolzenfeis. A handsome porter wanted to soak us 30 pfennings to watch 
		our bike. We got him down to 20, and then had another older gentlemen 
		keep them safe for 10. The entrance is beautiful. The buildings are on a 
		hill overlooking the river and in order to reach it we took a path 
		through a natural forest. The gate with drawbridge had the storybook 
		appearance, and that was a perfect start. The guide told us in broken 
		English that the place was built in 1252 by Archbishop Trier and then 
		was destroyed by the French and rebuilt by Friederick Wilhelm IV in the 
		19th century. First we stepped into a lovely chapel, decorated with the 
		finest of materials, and then we turned immediately into the wine cellar 
		which looked more like a dining room with Gothic vaulting and valuable 
		antique plates scattered around.<br><br>From many points we had grand 
		views of the Rhine Valley and framed glimpses of another castle across 
		the way. We passed from the well-kept garden court up through Gothic 
		arches and more vaulting into the main room where we had to put on large 
		slippers over our shoes as in Japanese temples, and thus protect the 
		floor. There were more rooms filled with exquisite pieces of 
		workmanship, presents from Royalty to the Royalty that lived here once 
		upon a time. There were inlaid tables shining golden goblets, carved 
		ivory boxes, ancient beer mugs. and a mutated of equally interesting 
		things. The guide kept throwing a bunch of dates and names at us, but 
		these went over our heads as we tried to remember just the items 
		themselves. We liked one room especially and were sorry we couldn’t get 
		a picture of it. It was a sitting room in red, from the upholstery to 
		the ceiling. The word “Royalty” seemed to be spelled out on every 
		object. We saw the music room, the reception room, and the King’s 
		bedroom but I wouldn’t have traded places with him. Even I slept 
		diagonally, my feet would still stick out. These must have been small 
		people, important or not. We passed through rooms around the courtyard 
		and on our way out the guide pointed out the Coat of Arms of the Royal 
		family<br><br>After a short rest on the watch-tower, with its view, we 
		walked back down the shaded path to bikes and then pedaled back on the 
		cobblestone road.<br><br>For various reasons we didn’t bother to linger 
		in Coblenz but continued close to 5 o’clock and Bad Godesberg. We had 
		met a kid on the road who was a good fellow and he directed us to our 
		lodging, placed behind the city. Bad Godesberg is a watering place and 
		health resort with a good climate. During the holidays the place is 
		packed with &#8730;isitor taking the baths and the cures. By the time we got 
		settled in the hostel, which is another model one, we were ready to eat. 
		The lady in the kitchen said she would fix us up, so we sat promptly 
		down.<br><br>There was a real holiday crowd of from farms in the next 
		room, and they had a band going full blast, a base drum setting the 
		pace. It wasn’t the best atmosphere for eating, as the couples spun 
		around the room, waltzing dangerously. There was a young fellow who 
		decided we needed company, He sat down uninvited and started talking in 
		German about his brother in Los Angeles, showing us photos of him. We 
		wanted to eat but if we even looked his way he would immediately break 
		in German that we didn’t comprehend. It’s difficult for us and 
		frustrating when someone keeps asking us questions in German or talking 
		in German when it must be obvious that we can’t understand. We're 
		probably angry with ourselves for not doing a better job with the 
		language. This crowd danced and was having such a good that the beer had 
		to be given the credit. Two were cooing to each other in a corner and 
		they were tight as ticks.<br><br>The meal was good wish plenty of gravy 
		as usual. For dessert we bought an ice cream across the street and then 
		started for home before the door was locked, as usual, dead tired<br>
		<br><br>33..Cologne July 14 T<br><br>We arrived in Cologne yesterday 
		afternoon after a short ride from Bad Godesberg. We got up early there, 
		had breakfast with two amiable Englishmen, cleaned our beds and room, 
		and started off just in time to hit a strong shower of rain. When it let 
		up, we took a back road for a few miles through beautiful forest country 
		to Bonn, where Beethoven was born. From there the road was mostly 
		cobblestone but we still moved right along anxious to get to Cologne and 
		find letters from home.<br><br>As we were riding into the city, I was 
		dreaming along at a good rate behind Dick. I was actually thinking about 
		the coins Dr.Wintz had given us when on the dirty slippery pavement my 
		bicycle dropped into a groove of a street car rail, and I was next off 
		balance and on the ground sliding under the bike. Fortunately I wasn’t 
		hurt beyond a few bruises but I looked up to see Dick turn around to 
		look at me and he met the same fate. He was for sure a Lyon “on the 
		ground”, lying on the ground(Pun?). As we picked ourselves up and rode 
		on at a more careful pace, we thanked our lucky stars that we remained 
		whole.<br><br>At the American Express we found mail and eagerly read. I 
		don’t know what we would do without this mail from home.<br><br>Without 
		a second look at the Cathedral or anything else we crossed the river and 
		rode up to the hostel. As we pulled up at the door, there were two 
		Americans near by so we talked and soon discovered that these same boys 
		had crossed the Atlantic with Carl Barrow and Tim Sullivan. It was good 
		to get the lowdown, and the letter from Carl sent to us by you, gave us 
		the turn of their plans. They said that there is a blonde mixed up in 
		Carl’s case so we will tread lightly.<br><br>After a refreshing lunch at 
		the hostel we walked across the bridge into the main part of town. 
		Cologne(Koln) has 735,000 people, is the largest city in the Rhine 
		Province and is one of the leading German trade centers. In our minds 
		tourists also play an important role in the economy, for there are so 
		many such. I think the River is most interesting, with truly grand 
		bridges and busy steamer traffic carrying coal, lumber, and other 
		cargoes moving against the stream. It is odd the way the tugs have to 
		tip their funnels backwards in order to pass under the bridges. And 
		there are two large bridges here. Historically, the Hohenzollern Bridge 
		ranks first for it is the line the Allied troops passed over on their 
		invasion, but from an engineering standpoint, the Hindenburg Bridge 
		takes the cake. It is green and is constructed in so simple a fashion, 
		at least to our eyes, that basic engineering principles take on the aura 
		of art.<br><br>Of course the Cathedral was quite wonderful. W had heard 
		every form of opinion on from those who have been here before, but to it 
		is great. The exterior is a mass of fancy decoration discolored to a 
		dirty gray, but the inside is excellent. It took three generations of 
		the same family to finish the work, and now, finally, decay is being 
		found in the stonework from the sulfuric acid in the smoky gasses 
		blanketing the city. Repairs are under way. The rest of the afternoon 
		was used up attempting much and accomplishing little<br><br>It was my 
		turn to be outfitted. My blue sweater, which at last broke my fine job 
		of patching the elbow, had to be replaced. But we looked in vain for a 
		sweater, so back to patching. At the hostel we enjoyed a good dinner 
		with our friends and then walked a block to see the sunset over the 
		Rhine and the city. It made a wonderful sight with bridge, cathedral 
		spires, the Rathaus tower, the rest of the jagged sky line, and last and 
		most colorful, the river boat lights passing below.<br><br>I forgot to 
		mention our haircuts. Dick was firmly set on getting a short one so I 
		followed suit by asking the barber to give me one that would last a 
		month. But I got one that will last for two months. It’s a real 
		“Deautscher.”<br><br>While we were in the shop, one big fellow came in 
		for a head shave, so common here. It was funny to see him rub his hand 
		over his smooth head, hunting for bristles or peach fuzz.<br><br>There 
		are a lot of youths parading about the city. It seems so unusual to us 
		to see the girls) (maedchen) in a standard dress, marching and singing a 
		stiff yet spirited song. It is just too bad! We realize every day what a 
		fortunate people we Americans are in matters of this kind. By the way, 
		we came across another aggravating American tourist in the Cunard 
		office. He didn’t know anything and didn’t care whose precious time he 
		was taking up. He evidently felt he had enough money to allow his 
		actions.<br><br>All of the American, Danish, English, and other foreign 
		boys have the same room here, so that is good. And good night.<br><br>
		<br>?...Heilbrunn July 7 T<br><br><br><br>I am writing in the 
		Jugendherberge while fellows are reading and writing, or eating dinner 
		of bread, butter, sausage, and bottled citronade. Outside there is a 
		drama going n in the form of another terrific storm. Fellows have been 
		coming in wet clear through,and it looks as if we are again in for it.<br>
		<br>This morning at Crailsheim we slept late, had breakfast of leftovers 
		from dinner and got started in the morning sunshine at nine o’clock. The 
		ride was not difficult but as the morning progressed we ran into some 
		good sized hills and had to a lot of pumping. During this period we 
		passed through the town of Hall, a truly lovely place with an old 
		church, plenty of worn cobblestones, quaint blind alleys and river 
		scenes with bridges and towers. We may have been heard to exclaim “Boy, 
		isn’t this great!” as we explore such places. As noon came and passed we 
		made the mistake of not stopping for lunch, but continued on in the hot 
		sun until one o’clock and reached the town we had been heading for. I 
		was really tired. My mind wasn’t clear, and I was thirsty! But after a 
		good lunch and rest on a bench, I felt better.<br><br>As we rode slowly 
		and leisurely we entered many small hamlets, and there were others 
		around us on each side. A barn, a fountain, a grilled work sign, a pump, 
		cobblestones, hay, empty wagons, and a “cocky” rooster strutting over 
		his domain, all combining to form a masterpiece of life. In the 
		afternoon we saw our first corn, hogs, and vineyards. We are getting 
		into the wine country.<br><br>At four o’clock we approached Heilbronn, 
		after a long coast down from the plateau we had been riding over. Some 
		of the views were quite special. The patchwork of the fields over the 
		rolling hills is always a joy to see.<br><br>In Heilbronn the hostel was 
		as usual on the other side of town, and after a lot of inquiring, we 
		found it. We got settled after our usual standup wash and a good many 
		drinks of cool water. Then, out into the town for fruit, our only desire 
		at the time. We found apricots and oranges and enjoyed them with zest. 
		You know, today it struck us that we have been away a very long time It 
		will be mighty good to get back to America. The hostel father has just 
		given us our beds. Nighty night...T<br><br><br>10 Brussels July 29?<br>
		<br><br><br>We’ve been in the first city of Belgium for only two hours, 
		but how these two hours have been spent. Your letters forwarded along 
		with some from Sally Ammen and Jean Booth were welcome and just the 
		tonic we need as we enter a strange and somewhat bewildering city. We 
		must look even stranger to the hurrying crowds for we were eyed and 
		gaped at as though we had just escaped from the Ripley Believe or Not 
		Museum. We must have looked especially comical today as we bounced over 
		Brussels’ cobblestone main thoroughfares, damp and bespotted with mud 
		with our packs ready to fall of at any moment, so loose have they become 
		on the racks. Ted’s German shoes and my sandals stump them, not to 
		mention the blue and red sweaters, just what the well-dressed gents do 
		not wear here. These sweaters give us away at once to vendors who know 
		tourists, even in Bavarian lederhosen and speaking German, so that 
		English newspapers are thrust at us by these canny salesmen. Yellow 
		sport shirts with hosentrager and leather shorts are a dead giveaway. 
		But you know something? We are damned proud to be Americans, 
		disreputable or not.<br><br><br><br>2 hours later with cheese and bread 
		from the corner store before us we set to work. Tonight we sleep in real 
		beds, after completely relaxing and, incidentally, getting cleaned in a 
		hot bath. Jugendherberge life is temporarily over until we get to 
		England so we are enjoying a new bit of comfort not at all hard to take. 
		We must be in condition for Paris. Madame is expecting us for a few 
		days, she writes, and we are looking forward to seeing this “entirely 
		different city”. Outside it’s pouring cats and dogs but” So What” as we 
		snuggle in our pension suite.<br><br><br>11 Brussels July 30<br><br><br>
		<br>We’re in another country and how different it is from the rest. As 
		we look out of the window I see weather beaten tile roofs, chimneys, and 
		murky clouds, and that has been my impression of Belgium during the last 
		two days. Now and then the sun comes through but just as often it is 
		raining. The other evening in Bruges we heard the story of Belgium in 
		the War and no battlefield could have been described more horribly. 
		Through his tears the innkeeper kept repeating in a choking voice, 
		“Fifty-two months in the trenches.” How our hearts went out to him.<br>
		<br>In contrast to that we listened to the carillon bells from the 
		Belfry Tower all night long in our hostel, and with morning we were 
		ready to move on again. It was not long before our bags were packed and 
		we were eating eggs on toast in a Swiss Patisserie. After taking a few 
		pictures along the canals, we left the city and took the path along the 
		main canal to Ghent. We had been told by an American that we would find 
		houses along the way where we could purchase lace, but none presented 
		themselves. After several unsuccessful attempts at different peasant 
		houses, we found a place that said “dentelle”. From a small suitcase the 
		lady brought out several patterns. We purchased two that seemed to the 
		best, thanking her for her trouble. It was an interesting experience. 
		Lace is used here a great deal in curtains, chair covers, table pieces, 
		and in many other ways.<br><br>The furniture and decorations seem to be 
		all wearing out. The atmosphere is not clean and the people aren’t 
		either. Houses are of brick or stone with several coats of whitewash, 
		and the roof is tiled. Usually there are some semblances of a garden in 
		front and always there is a barnyard at the rear. It looked to us like 
		the genuine thing we were looking is where only a bicycle and canal boat 
		could easily go, and the expected vibrant peasant life is rare to see.<br>
		<br>The canal ride was much the same all; of the way. Tall trees, dirty 
		water and in puddles, green fields, and barges being towed are my 
		impressions. I know that i was feeling rather low after days of riding 
		and not very healthy eating, so I didn’t enjoy things as much as I would 
		have if feeling fresh. Then the rain began so we slushed and dodged 
		puddles all of the way to Ghent.<br><br>About noon we arrived there. The 
		first need was for food, and then to see the sights. We found a clean 
		looking restaurant near the castle and fully enjoyed a good meal. 
		However, we weren’t satisfied and had to finish off with some bread and 
		butter in a nearby bakery.<br><br>The first of our sightseeing tour ws 
		the Chateau de Comptes de Flandre, a picturesque castle dating from the 
		9th to 11 th centuries. It is the best preserved castle that we have 
		seen, and more like the one we dream about and now finally find. The 
		torture room was the most interesting but a few looks at the guillotine 
		blades, gruesome drawings, and bone-breakers finished me off. It was not 
		the best thing to see after lunch. More enjoyable were the banquet halls 
		and reception rooms, but best of all was the view from the roof of the 
		city with its fancy medieval style tall church steeples, canals, 
		bridges, dirty roofs and smoke. It was an unusual combination to our 
		eyes. When the sun finally came out after a heavy shower, everything 
		took on a more wholesome aspect as tower and battlements seemed to 
		shine.<br><br>Not far away on one of the main squares stands the 
		Cathedral of St. Bavon, unattractive from the outside but with a 
		wonderful interior. It reminded of a Rome church and we enjoyed seeing 
		the familiar painting, ”Adoration of the Lamb,” so very famous.<br><br>
		In the city once more we were struck with how “old” is everything. 
		Modern buildings are absent and even the bicycles seem ancient. Only 
		Oldsmobiles looked new. We bumped over the cobblestones and out of the 
		city and took the poor bicycle path to Brussels. It rained a great deal 
		of the way and my tire came down with a slow leak, needing attention 
		every few kilometers. Now we particularly noticed how poorly dressed and 
		unclean were the people along the road, cyclers included. A rough cap, a 
		dark muffler, and a dirty sweater make the picture. Of the ride itself I 
		remember that we were hurrying to get to Brussels and mail, and that 
		there were hills making it harder without gears. And the cobblestones 
		were overpowering. I often wonder where these stones have all come from.<br>
		<br>At bout 5 o’clock Brussels arrived and we waded through traffic to 
		American Express. At the tourist office we read your good letters. How 
		we look forward to them! However our clothes and shoes were wet and 
		remembering the cold I had in Heidelberg from wet shoes, we hurriedly 
		found a pension in the Hand Me Down and rode to it. The proprietor is OK 
		and the price reasonable. And the room looked like a repeat of the night 
		we spent in Bruges. A bath and clean clothes pit us back in the running. 
		After a dinner which didn’t please our appetites we walked out and 
		returned with bread and cheese for a follow up, which reminds me that 
		Dick wishes it to be known that he now likes cheese. What a wonderful 
		thing is travel.<br><br>Our first impressions of Brussels have been 
		unusually good. It seems much cleaner than the Belgian cities this far. 
		There are scads of good looking American automobiles and the main 
		boulevards are lined with sidewalk restaurants. The traffic is heavy, 
		and well-dressed people make us think of Paris for it is so different 
		from Ghent and Bruges. We notice that almost everyone speaks French, and 
		French influence seems dominant. Perhaps this makes the difference.<br>
		<br>Well, in a day or so we’ll be in Paris. We received word from Mme. 
		Chibou in answer to our not saying she is expecting us for a few days in 
		her home. That is wonderful news. T<br><br><br>13 Brussels July 30 T<br>
		<br><br><br>Evening is coming on and we have our window open an can hear 
		someone’s radio. We have been on our feet most of the day trying to 
		absorb something of this large city. We wrote letters until 10;30 this 
		morning. Then we started out to seek our fortunes. <br><br>There is not 
		a great deal to say about Brussels. One day of course is hardly enough 
		to know the city. We have noticed many monuments to the dead scattered 
		throughout the city. The buildings in the older part of town are even 
		now decrepit, their dirty exteriors, still impressive and aristocratic. 
		Big boulevards bordered by shops, cinemas, restaurants and large stores 
		run for a good distance all through the city.<br><br>On the morning 
		wandering we visited the Town Hall and adjoining square. The Hall we 
		liked very much for its Gothic style. and the whole square is considered 
		one of the finest in Europe. In the Town Hall a French guide led us 
		through highly ornamental rooms where Maximillian and other historic 
		figures are portrayed. The Gothic hall with its Guild flags was 
		colorful. Outside and surrounding other parts of the square are the 
		Guild Houses, restored to their original medieval designs demanding an 
		abundance of gold leaf. The small group of flower stands in the center 
		with their colors added a great deal scene.<br><br>Just of the main 
		street we found a simple appearing restaurant, just a bar, pool room, 
		and beer hall, and enjoyed good lunch. Ice cream and pastry around the 
		corner served to satisfy us a bit more. These French meals are not as 
		filling as the Dutch. After lunch we browsed, looking in shop windows. 
		admiring the lace and wondering if it is really genuine.<br><br>Earlier 
		in the day we had tried unsuccessfully to contact the Rotary President, 
		so again we tried and found him. After a short conversation in French he 
		wished us “Good Luck” and we went on with our business. Railroad 
		tickets, shirts, envelopes, iodine, black thread, a comb, and ice cream 
		all took their share of the bankroll. Five o’clock found us in a 
		restaurant of the big department store, having dinner in style followed 
		by ice cream and the walk back to the pension. The ice cream here is 
		good and we enjoy it like some people enjoy beer. On the way we 
		purchased a good looking apricot pie and have just finished this 
		delicious morsel in our room. Well, tomorrow it is Paris and hope it 
		won’t disappoint us. T<br><br><br>15 Paris August 2 T<br><br>You may be 
		interested to know just where I am writing on our second full day in 
		Paris. It is a long story on how we got here. Alone, in this comfortable 
		attic room in this old aristocratic house we have an unobstructed view 
		of the Eiffel Tower and and the entire west section of irregular roofs. 
		At night the Tower is lighted and to the right is the Seine, and the 
		light form the gardens at the Place de la Concorde, where the guillotine 
		cut its way long ago. Below and cross the street one would suspect that 
		there are lovely gardens and carriage yards within closed doors.<br><br>
		Last night it rained again so we took a cheap hotel and made the best of 
		it. This morning we got up early, cleaned our bikes and had hot 
		chocolate and rolls at a counter nearby. Then we decided to get going on 
		our business and introductions. We found Mr. Beranger;’s address to be 
		near and were soon ushered into his beautiful apartment. We had come to 
		merely pay our respects. In a few minutes Mr. Beranger appeared, dressed 
		informally and with a bandage over one eye. He and his wife had been in 
		an auto accident in Egypt. His wife is in Berlin, recovering slowly, and 
		he has just been operated on here in Paris. It seems that in Egypt a 
		native with no sense of the road threw himself in front of the car. 
		Luckily the car was not going fast, but had to swerve and hit a tree as 
		it missed the man.<br><br>In the first few minutes of our meeting we 
		were fully at ease. What a marvelous host he is. First he asked where we 
		were staying, and then invited us to take two rooms upstairs in his 
		house. No questions were needed, and we were overwhelmed. He also 
		presented us with half-price passes to the Casino de Paris, Follies 
		Bergere and others, all of which we will use.<br><br>We were then 
		introduced to his brother, Harry, who is also a swell guy, and we liked 
		so much the woman secretary who set about looking out for us. Out host 
		has his office at home, and he is a collector and connoisseur of 
		oriental, particularly Siamese, antiquities. His rooms are so 
		beautifully furnished in that style. We hurried back to the hotel to get 
		our things, paid the bill, and returned. Before lunch we got into our 
		rooms after a half hour discovering the keys. Finally, Shido the 
		Japanese cook got us in and we flipped for the rooms. Dick took the 
		upper and I the lower, both with wonderful views. We live on the top 
		floor up 6 flights of back stairs and we love it. The climb keeps us in 
		condition, for what we are not sure. Since the Japanese boy uses my room 
		usually, it is nicely furnished in his country’s style.<br><br>
		“Maintenant” we ate a most delicious lunch with our two hosts and a lady 
		guest who is studying the art of makeup in Paris and who will later 
		return to new York to fill an important position there. The broiled 
		chicken, something far better than we deserve, was absolutely perfect 
		and I shall never forget the final custard for it melted in my mouth. 
		This Japanese cook has been in the finest kitchens in Paris and knows 
		his onions and sauces, adding to his knowledge of oriental seasoning and 
		cooking.<br><br>After lunch, following our host’s advice, we took a walk 
		to aquatint ourselves with the city. We started at the Gardens of the 
		Tuillerries just across the river, where statuary and fountains and 
		formal garden floral arrangements abound. At the Place de la Concorde, 
		which Monsieur Beranger describes as the finest in the world of its kind 
		we stood looking past it to the Arch de Triumphe, the obelisk from Luxor 
		and at each of the four corners of the square the two figures 
		representing the cities of France. Although all is changed since the 
		Revolution, there is still a “mob” always encircling the square, not of 
		people but of speeding taxis.<br><br>From the “Place” we walked down the 
		boulevard leading to the Arch. Formal shaded gardens give way to 
		automobile display windows and sidewalk cafes, but fashionably dressed 
		women and beret covered men were always with us. As we approached the 
		Arch, it was like visiting an old friend because it is so familiar. 
		Under the Arch we paid our respects to the Unknown Soldier of the World 
		War.<br><br>As we continued on towards the Eiffel Tower the clouds began 
		to disperse and form beautifully behind it. What a mass of iron it is, 
		almost 1000 feet high and dominating everything.<br><br>We found our way 
		back to our residence by use of our map and in a short time were eating 
		dinner Mr. Beranger had ordered special steaks and fried potatoes for 
		us. He is such a remarkable and thoughtful host. After dinner we walked 
		again to t the Place de la Concorde, now brilliantly lighted and took 
		some pictures. About eleven we stopped at an open air restaurant and 
		enjoyed a hot cup of chocolate. But even more enjoyable and fascinating 
		were the people around and going by us. That is what makes Paris unique, 
		for you can order something to drink and sit there undisturbed by 
		waiters for as long as you wish just ruminating. At midnight we walked 
		slowly along the Seine and to our “penthouse’ and had little trouble 
		dropping off to sleep.<br><br><br>16 Paris August 16 <br><br><br><br>We 
		are sitting high in our Paris garret roost looking out over a roof and 
		chimney scene that was once the aristocratic center of this gayest of 
		cities. Every morning Mr. Eiffel Tower is up ahead of us, greeting us 
		each day in the same cordial unspoken manner while wading ankle deep in 
		sedate old Paris. He seems like an old fried now, always the first to 
		venture a “ Bon Matin.”<br><br>All around us are grand mansions rising 
		five and six stories, their sandstone exteriors now weather beaten grays 
		and blacks, and to the casual eye of seemingly monotonous design. But if 
		one were to peek through the massive timber doors opening into shaded 
		streets, he would find lovely courtyards in kingly style with miniature 
		gardens and trembling trees. It is in these city center courts that 
		Paris aristocrats have their own tiny words, many still occupying 
		ancestral mansions.<br><br><br><br>AUGUST 2.....<br><br>After a super 
		night’s sleep in our chambers just seven stories up we enjoyed an even 
		more super breakfast in the Beranger “salle a mange,” and in the 
		saturated atmosphere of Beranger hospitality. “Petite dejeuner in this 
		house hold is a premier experience. Mr. Beranger is just like a bouncing 
		bal, always running about seeing to his guest’s needs. Shide, the 
		unsurpassed Japanese cook, takes a real beating as he is kept 
		continually on the run, fetching more croissons, jam, tea, or butter. 
		What a picture this table is with the Beranger brothers in their 
		dressing gowns both goading us on to greater eating records, to the 
		accompaniment of chuckles and explosive laughter. And we enjoy each 
		morsel of such delicacies as ham and eggs. These men are what we term 
		“good guys” and what better recommendations can we give? With all his 
		tremendous business responsibilities-he is head of Standard Oil for 
		Europe-and banged up head, Malcom Branger (Bear-an jay) gets a real 
		honest to goodness kick out of life and surely knows the avenue to a 
		lad’s heart. Boy, would you, Dad and our host have a good time slinging 
		it.<br><br>At breakfast also was a Mr.Ballantyne, a leading London 
		lawyer, and his ten year old daughter Jean. She’s a real little lady, 
		and just about your speed Bruce. With real Beranger hospitality they 
		have been put up for the weekend too and are among the lucky ones to 
		take part in these morning breakfast festivities.<br><br>Every chance we 
		get we pump our friends on Intentional political and economic questions. 
		A few minutes of wisdom from Mr. Ballantyne added greatly to our fund of 
		information. It’s the break of a lifetime to be able to listen to such 
		well informed men, Mr. Ballantyne being an authority on problems facing 
		Europe.<br><br>On the first Sunday of each month the fountains of 
		Versailles play from 4 to 5 PM, so at 11 o’clock, Jean, Ted and Irma, an 
		American friend of Harry studying cosmetics here, set out under the able 
		guidance of Harry Beranger also of the hearty laugh, and well qualified 
		as a guide, as just one the many professions he has delved into. I am 
		sure that he slept well that night after answering our incessant 
		questions such as “What period is this. and “why” questions for hours.<br>
		<br>The day was overcast as usual, again much to our disappointment, but 
		hopes were high for a little sunshine when the fountains would play. A 
		short train ride deposited us at the town of Versailles, were we walked 
		about a bit before summoning a taxi to take us to the Gardens. The 
		entire plan of city and palace grounds is a marvelous accomplishment. 
		Louis XIV laid out a system of streets that should stand as a model in 
		this present day of congested traffic. Three broad tree lined avenues 
		lead away from the spacious palace courtyard, sufficed and designed as 
		though expressly for heavy high-speed traffic.<br><br>We found it 
		difficult to picture the pomp and splendor that must have filled the 
		rough cobblestone courtyard, so great were the throngs of people 
		streaming through wrought iron gates into the palace grounds, for 
		Versailles fountains displays are a rarity even for Parisians these 
		days,<br><br>There is so much that can be said about the palace and 
		gardens that I can’t possibly even begin. It is all in the guide books 
		and encyclopedias, though so I will sketch just a few of our 
		impressions.<br><br>Lying in h northern extremity of Versailles Gardens 
		are the Grand and Petite Trianons, the first a palace built for Madame 
		Maintenon by Louise XIV, and the second a palace for Madame du Bovery 
		built by Louis V. Simplicity in exterior design sets the fashion in both 
		miniature palaces. After a quick survey of the Grand Trianon’s 
		furnishings all in keeping with the magnificence of that period, we 
		strolled though the lovely palace gardens planted in the usual formal 
		French style, but of unusual beauty, so harmonious now are the colors. 
		Tiny fountains form center-pieces for each tableau, the entire display 
		bounded by forests of broad leafed trees. After a few “snaps” and we 
		then entered the Petite Trianon, now famous for the fact that Marie 
		Antoinette chose this palace as her favorite residence. Style and design 
		are forgotten as one enjoys just grandeur of what man has produced from 
		a simple farm and forest land during the reign of Louis Quatorze.<br>
		<br>Of special interest to us were the forms of peasant houses built and 
		used by Marie Antoinette when she tired of the court pomp and splendor. 
		Thatch roofs and half timber designs, replete with balconies garlanded 
		with flowers, a tiny mirror lake e slightly ruffled by geese and ducks, 
		and a forest peacefulness characterize this loveliest part, we think, of 
		the Versailles Gardens.<br><br>Lunch in a down town cafe was another 
		unmatched experience. Harry ordered for us what he called a real French 
		meal. We ate everything from sausages of pig’s blood to pigs feet, not 
		to mention the hoggish feeling this produced as we filled up.<br><br>Our 
		waitress informed us that the Tour de France, greatest of bike races, 
		would pass by at three o’clock, so we lined up with the mob outside and 
		waited anxiously for our bother cyclers to round the bend. At 4 o’clock 
		they showed up working like Trojans over the cobblestone pavement as the 
		final stretch to Paris begins. Two hundred kilometers a day to these 
		fellows is duck soup and they seemed to need no encouragement, looking 
		as fresh as daisies. All carried a spare tire around their chests, but 
		from the closeness of the race, I am sure that “time to retire” was not 
		in anyone’s mind,<br><br>Lynch finally finished at four fifteen and we 
		hurried off to the Chateau to inspect this home of unqualified splendor. 
		We enjoyed every bit of the gorgeous display even though rooms and halls 
		were packed to capacity with the Sunday crowd, including some 5000 
		Canadian legionares. Kingly chambers, and banquet halls all in gold 
		leaf, and artistic masterpieces all seemed as fresh as the day they were 
		created. Louis XIV ultra heavy designs dwindled almost to simplicity in 
		the great “Gallerie des Glace” with all of the mirrors, a luxury worthy 
		of only the greatest of monarchs in Lous Quatorze’ day. It was in this 
		magnificent reception salon that many a bit of history has been made, 
		including the signing of the Versailles Treaty the articles that have 
		shaken the foundations of the world’s political and economic 
		foundations.<br><br>Fountains were playing as we stepped outside in the 
		world’s grandest of gardens. Hardy had we taken three steps when the 
		“pat,pat,pat” of raindrops announced stormy weather. However, we had 
		come to see the fountains and a little bad weather would not deter are 
		determination to enjoy the display. The fountains of Versailles are 
		familiar to all of us and photographs will have to do. Bronze figures 
		and pool floral displays add to the majesty at that moment, yet we are 
		sure we saw Versailles in its most disagreeable mood, its paths crowded 
		with people. With clothes and flowers dampened equally by the constant 
		drizzle, we did the best we could to imagine the sight on a sunny day, 
		and with just a few souls walking about. Pure fantasy for sure, but Ted 
		and I are quite used to getting more than our money’s worth even if the 
		price it too high when the product is wet. We hope we can return with 
		the sun up but won’t count on it. Wet or not it has been a day to 
		remember with friends and food the high spots above the water line. I 
		must close now for we have a dinner engagement with Mr. Franck. There is 
		still a lot more to tell.</td>
