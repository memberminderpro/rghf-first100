		CANADA is entertaining thousands of visitors this summer. Many of them 
		remark that they hardly realize the country is at war, for they go about 
		their pleasures, as is the tourists' wont in peacetime. That is as we 
		would have it, for Canada takes pride in its hospitality–a word I pass 
		on now in anticipation of next June, when Toronto, Ontario, will be host 
		to Rotary International's annual Convention.<br><br>A war without 
		casualty lists does seem unreal. After a year and a half, Canada has had 
		but 700 casualties in its Army, Navy and Air Force, a number to be 
		compared with 15,000 for a comparable period in the last War. But let 
		the casual visitor be not deceived. Canada is at war–to the finish. From 
		the Atlantic to the Pacific she is throbbing with war activity.<br><br>
		When the war started, Canada had in the three fighting services but 
		10,500 men. On active service today in the Army, Navy, and Air Force 
		there are a quarter of a million men enlisted to serve wherever duty may 
		require them. And there are over 175,000 additional enrolled in the 
		Reserve Army, subject to call for defense in the Dominion of Canada.<br>
		<br>On the English Channel, Britain's front line, are a Canadian Army 
		Corps and other troops aggregating nearly 70,000. Canadian destroyers 
		and Canadian air squadrons have been for many months sharing in the 
		defense of Britain. Canada's Navy and Air Force are doing their part to 
		keep open the vital sea lanes of the North Atlantic. Canadian garrisons 
		are on guard in the Island outposts. Canadian engineers are 
		strengthening the defenses of Gibraltar. In recent months Canada has 
		sent overseas, besides thousands of armed forces, hundreds of radio 
		mechanics for vital defense duties with the Royal Air Force, and 2,500 
		more of these are now in training.<br><br>Sailors and soldiers and 
		airmen are cooperating in the defense of Canadian coasts and coastal 
		waters—and we don't realize half enough what a strain and grind that 
		ceaseless vigil is. The Canadian Navy, which had only 15 ships when war 
		broke out, now has over 180. The strength of the &quot;silent service&quot; has 
		increased from 2,000 to 17,000 to 25,000. Nearly 60 Army mobilization 
		and training camps are operating across the Dominion. In these camps 
		about 175,000 soldiers of our Active Army are fitting themselves for 
		service anywhere, and there are also about 10,000 young men called up 
		under the National Resources Mobilization Act for defense of Canada.<br>
		<br>The R.C.A.F. (Royal Canadian Air Force) has grown to a strength of 
		about 50 000. Besides activities overseas and in Canada, the Air Force 
		has the responsibility of administering the British Commonwealth Air 
		Training Plan–which calls for the expenditure of 600 million dollars, 
		most of it supplied by Canada. There are at this minute across Canada no 
		less than 81 establishments of the British Commonwealth Air Training 
		Plan in operation. The Plan calls for 106, and these will be in 
		operation six months ahead of time. Many graduates of these schools are 
		already in England to take their part in the battles of the air. Twice 
		as many pilots and observers have been graduated as were planned for up 
		to this time, and before the year is out we expect that these schools 
		will have produced six times the number called for by the original 
		schedule.<br><br>CANADA'S three services have a quarter of a million men 
		enrolled for service anywhere in the world. About 80,000 of these 
		sailors, soldiers, and airmen are in service in the British Isles at 
		this moment. In addition to these, Canada is pledged to send to 
		Britain's aid this year thousands of reinforcements, ancillary troops, 
		an Army Tank Brigade, the Third Division, and an Armored Division. And 
		out of the 1,450 million dollars estimated to be expended for the three 
		fighting services this year, probably 1,200 million or more is planned 
		to be expended on troops and equipment for service overseas.<br><br>In 
		terms of dollars the cost of the three defense services alone is 
		estimated for this year at 1,300 million dollars. It is being paid for 
		in full by the Canadian people. It is a direct, outright, and unreserved 
		contribution by Canada to the cause of freedom. It represents this 
		year's portion of the freewill offering, which our country began to make 
		over a year and a half ago, when Parliament decided that Canada should 
		enter the war at the side of Britain.<br><br>But Canada has a twofold 
		task in this war. Not only is the country sharing as a full partner in 
		the struggle, not only are Canadians (with but one important 
		exception—namely, the maintenance in the field of pilots and airmen 
		graduated from the Air Training Plan) bearing the whole cost of 
		equipping, supplying, and maintaining our naval, military, and air 
		forces at home and overseas, giving of life as well as of treasure, but 
		Canada is also helping to supply Britain equipment, munitions, and the 
		other essentials of war.<br><br>Today Canada is a major source of supply 
		for Britain. New plants have been built and old plants have been 
		extended to make the complicated instruments of war, many of which were 
		never before made in this country. The response of labor and industry 
		has been splendid. Canada has been constructing an aircraft industry 
		from the ground up. Already more than 50 small naval vessels have been 
		built and many more are being built. Hundreds of motor-transport 
		vehicles are being turned out every day. Canada is producing universal 
		carriers, machine guns, trench mortars, bombs for aircraft, electrical 
		apparatus, and radio equipment, many other types of essential 
		manufactured goods, great quantities of shells and ammunition, a wide 
		range of chemicals, large quantities of base metals and alloys, and an 
		increased output of steel. Very shortly Canada will begin to produce 
		field guns and then tanks and Lee-Enfield rifles, and, before the year 
		ends, naval guns and antiaircraft and antitank guns. The production of 
		cargo vessels is in hand and plans are being made to build destroyers in 
		Canada.<br><br>The estimated cost for its direct war effort, sketched in 
		the foregoing paragraphs, is 1,450 million dollars, and for its indirect 
		war effort during the next 12 months–munitions, raw materials, and 
		agricultural products to be sent to England–Canada expects to spend 1 
		1/2 billion dollars. And Canada will finance these purchases for 
		Britain's account to an amount estimated at 1,150 million dollars.<br>
		<br>Ever since the war started, whatever gold or United States dollars 
		Canada gets from Britain to help pay for these goods is used immediately 
		to pay the United States for war purchases. That means that any gold 
		coming from Britain does not reduce by one dollar the amount which must 
		be raised from the Canadian public in taxes and loans.<br><br>To sum up 
		quickly: For war alone this year Canada expects to spend on her own 
		account probably 1,450 million dollars. To help finance British 
		purchases, Canada will probably have to find 1,150 million dollars more. 
		In short, this year Canada will probably have to obtain 2,600 million 
		dollars for war purposes in taxes and loans—obtain it from about 11 
		million people.<br><br>The estimated United States' national income is 
		probably over 14 times what Canada's is. On that basis, Canada's 
		estimated war expenditure direct and indirect in this fiscal year would 
		be equal to an expenditure by the United States in a single year of 
		almost 35 billion dollars, and of that the financial assistance which 
		Canada will be giving to Britain would be equivalent to an expenditure 
		by the United States of something over 15 billion dollars. And if the 
		quarter of a million Canadians on active service, without taking into 
		account Canada's Reserve Army, were translated into terms of the 
		population of the United States, the armed forces of that country would 
		exceed 2 3/4 million men.<br><br>I do not cite such facts to be 
		boastful. War is too serious a matter for such idle conceit. I bring 
		them forward to show how, back of the scene that greets the tourist's 
		eye throughout Canada, there are a resolute determination and a 
		far-reaching activity to carry the fight to the finish. With planned 
		effectiveness it is summoning the nation's strength for the grim, 
		unflagging task ahead.</span></td>
