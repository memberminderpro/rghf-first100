				<b>By Paul U. Unschuld</b><br>
				<br>
				The Rotary Club of Munich was founded on 2 November 1928 as the 
				fourth Rotary Club in Germany, preceded only by the Rotary Clubs 
				of <a href="../../countries/index.htm#1927">Hamburg</a> and Frankfurt (both founded in 1927), and Cologne 
				(founded in 1928). It may have been the dominating influence 
				exerted by the Viennese Rotarians (who together with the RC 
				Hamburg founded the Club in Munich) which resulted in a 
				significant number of representatives of the arts and sciences 
				among the founding members of the Rotary Club of Munich. The 
				most famous </font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">
				<img alt="[Photo: Thomas Mann]" src="../../../images/thomasmann.jpg" border="0" align="left" width="200" height="299"></font><font size="2">member happened to be 
				<b>Thomas Mann</b> (left) who was awarded 
				the Nobel Prize in literature in 1929. When the RC Munich marked 
				this event with a festive reception, </font><font size="2">Thomas Mann used the 
				occasion to explicitly express his support of the international 
				mission of Rotary to further humaneness and freedom. It was only 
				four years later, on 4 April 1933, that the celebrated author, 
				now in exile in Switzerland, <u>was removed from the list of 
				members</u> together with several Jewish and non-Jewish Rotarians 
				who appeared politically unacceptable under Nazi rule. The 
				circumstances of this move remain unclear to this day. </font>
				<p><font size="2">Years before they were able to rise to power, 
				the Nazi Party had made no secret of its aversion to the Rotary 
				movement which it considered a branch of <b>
				<a href="../../../history/history/otherorganizations/freemasonry/index.htm">international 
				freemasonry</a></b> and therefore incompatible with the “ethnic German 
				movement” it intended to push. In 1933, several German Rotary 
				Clubs decided to disband their organizations. Encouraged by 
				national and international exhortations to maintain the ideals 
				of Rotary even under Nazi rule, such plans were not realized for 
				the time being. Despite the fact that some members of the Rotary 
				Club of Munich became actively engaged in the anti-Nazi 
				resistance movement, the attempts to ensure the survival of 
				their Rotary Club provide, from hindsight, an example of a 
				policy of appeasement that was bound to fail. In 1937, after 
				four years of negotiations, those opinion leaders in the Nazi 
				party prevailed who saw no common basis with Rotary. Their 
				decision to the effect that membership in Rotary and in the Nazi 
				Party were irreconcilable finally convinced all Rotary Clubs of 
				Germany that it was time to dissolve themselves. </font></p>
				<p><font size="2">Immediately afterwards all German Rotary files 
				were confiscated by the Gestapo. Found in a German archive by 
				the Red Army in 1945, they were brought to Moscow from where 
				they were returned to East Germany in the 1950s and 1960s. 
				Following the reunification of Germany they were deposited in 
				the National Prussian Archives in Berlin where they are open for 
				research now. On the occasion of the celebration of the 75th 
				anniversary of its foundation in 2003, the Rotary Club of Munich 
				has authorized an analysis of the files associated with the 
				Rotary Club of Munich (some 30.000 pages) in the archive in 
				Berlin. The result of this first substantial review of the 
				history of the Club under Nazi rule has been published as the 
				second chapter in a chronicle covering the entire 75 years since 
				its foundation in 1928 with many illustrations and quotes from 
				the original documents. The chronicle includes four parts.
				</font></p>
				<p><font size="2">A recollection by Walther Meuschel, a founding 
				member of the RC Munich, of the years 1928 through 1948, written 
				at the occasion of the Club’s 50th anniversary in 1978, as was a 
				view on the years from 1949 through 1978 by Benno Keim. Paul 
				Unschuld, in addition to contributing the analysis of the period 
				of 1933 through 1937, added as a fourth chapter a survey of the 
				years from 1978 through 2003. In the early years of the Rotary 
				Club of Munich a deep-felt enthusiasm motivated its members to 
				enter international relationships following the trauma of 
				isolation and economic depression after World War I. From 1937 
				to 1948 members of the former Rotary Club of Munich met 
				privately to uphold their ideals. When the reappearance of 
				Rotary in Germany was permitted by the political administration 
				in 1948, some surviving members of the old club together with 
				newly won Rotarian friends brought the Rotary Club of Munich 
				back to life. </font></p>
				<p><font size="2">In 1949, Rotary International renewed its 
				charter of the Rotary Club of Munich which soon afterwards was 
				founded again on 12 October 1949. It was now that the Rotary 
				Club of Munich was able to expand and flourish in a democratic 
				society firmly integrated into the moral value system of the 
				Western world. For the past 54 years it has been able to 
				continuously attract members who in their positions in society, 
				including commerce and the arts, the sciences and medicine, have 
				reached leadership positions and at the same time were able to 
				uphold Rotarian values. </font></p>
				<p><font size="2">The Rotary Club of Munich has established 
				close and intimate relationships with its partner clubs in St. 
				Gallen/Switzerland (since 1954) and Merano/Italy (since 1964). 
				It has participated in international Rotary activities (such as 
				group study exchanges) and has itself founded several Rotary 
				Clubs in Munich and elsewhere. In 1987, Munich was the venue of 
				the World Convention and hosted about 25,000 Rotarian 
				participants. Aside from furthering and maintaining friendship 
				among its members, the Rotary Club of Munich has provided 
				valuable assistance to charity projects regionally and 
				internationally. In particular following German reunification, 
				projects in the former GDR have been several times the focus of 
				support. One of the highlights was the renovation of the Abbey 
				St. Marienstern in Saxony. For this purpose the members of the 
				Rotary Club of Munich donated DM 150 000 in 1990 and 1991, and 
				were able to raise another 45 million DM from other sources to 
				rescue this national landmark and asylum for mentally retarded 
				women from its most deplorable condition. </font></p>
				<p style="margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -1px"><font size="2">On the occasion of its 75th anniversary, the 
				club donated 100 000 Euro to a project in Munich aiming at 
				integrating socially disadvantaged teenagers into the work 
				force. Seen in retrospect, the history of the RC Munich in 
				post-WWII Germany offers an impression of a vital club life tied 
				to the international values of Rotary International and 
				contributing significantly to social welfare in its own 
				environment.<br>

				view of the Zisterzienserinnen Abbey St. Marienstern in Saxonia 
				after the refurbishment</b><br>
				The biggest and most demanding task ever undertaken by the 
				Rotary Club of Munich was the refurbishment of the Abbey St. 
				Marienstern in Saxonia, formerly East Germany. Since decades the 
				sisters of this abbey cared for disabled girls and women. After 
				the fall of the wall, starting with the Christmas collections of 
				1990 and 1991, more than 80.000 Dollars were donated towards the 
				refurbishment of the abbey. However, the resources of the Rotary 
				Club of Munich were not nearly sufficient to finance this 
				tremendous task.<br>
				<br>
				In the end, the challenge of the refurbishment of the Abbey St. 
				Marienstern showed, that remarkable accomplishments are possible 
				against all odds. A small group of highly dedicated Rotarians 
				used their economical and professional knowledge, their personal 
				acquaintance with decision makers and the will to make financial 
				sacrifices - metaphorically spoken like a nucleus of 
				crystallization – to subsequently motivate a larger group of 
				friends and other forces to take action. The reward was the 
				knowledge of having saved historically outstanding buildings 
				from destruction. Probably more important, having created for 
				the sisters an unexpected, long lasting and sound basis, who 
				since centuries made sacrifices far from the hustle and bustle 
				of every-day life, caring for a group persons on the brink of 
				our society.<br>
				<br>
				The joining of many very different sources finally led to a 
				financial support of twenty-five million dollars. </font></td>
