        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">In the 
        same way as the Board of Directors of Rotary international issues 
        charters, so it can revoke or cancel charters where for specific 
        reasons, any club does not, or can not, operate within the accepted 
        rules and style of a Rotary Club. Most frequently this has occurred in 
        countries where a totalitarian regime has forbidden meetings of Rotary 
        and similar clubs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Thus, 
        &quot;in July 1936 almost immediately after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil 
        War, the Rotary Clubs in that country ceased to operate&quot; (Board minutes 
        January 1940). At first, the Board of Directors did nothing directly 
        about this but at their meeting in mid-July 1936 the Board 
        recorded,&nbsp;that, &quot;It appears that there are or may be occasions when the 
        board would be fully justified in canceling the charter of a club in the 
        ENAEM region **. Such cancellations should be made, of course, with the 
        same due deliberation that has always characterized the procedure of the 
        board in such instances.&quot; At this meeting, the members of the board 
        resident in the region were authorized to act in canceling club 
        charters, subject to a unanimous vote of those members.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">In 
        practice, RI ceased to maintain contact with the 28 Spanish clubs 
        although still counting them among their total of clubs in the world. 
        However, following a report in June 1939 by RI President Maurice 
        Duperrey, 1937-38, the cancellation of Spanish charters was agreed to, 
        and by a decision of the full board in January 1940, effective 
        immediately, the 2 in the Canaries and 24 in Spain,&nbsp;and the Tetuan club 
        in Spanish Morocco had their membership officially terminated. At the 
        same time, the general &quot;secretary was released from any further 
        obligation to obtain the charters issued to these clubs&quot;.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
		<a name="danzig">It</a> was 
        also possible for clubs to resign from Rotary International upon the 
        return of their certificate of membership to the General Secretary of 
        RI. In Germany, the National Socialist Party (the Nazi party) decreed 
        that membership of the party was not compatible with membership of a 
        Rotary club, and by December 31, 1937, party members had to withdraw 
        from Rotary. As a result, all the clubs in Germany and in <b>Danzig</b> 
        resigned and officially disbanded, except for four; Gorlitz, Liegnitz, 
        Heilbronn and Garmisch, none of which returned their charters. Although 
        they did not actually exist, they remained nominally on the records of 
        RI. By contrast, a similar situation occurred in Austria following the 
        country's occupation by Germany in 1938, where four clubs failed to 
        surrender their charters. These were Innsbruck, Vienna, Villach and 
        Wiener-Neustadt. However, a Board meeting in June 1938 terminated their 
        membership anyway!&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">In 
        January 1940, the Board officially terminated the membership of the 39 
        clubs in Czechoslovakia. Some clubs had effectively ceased to exist 
        after September 1938, and after the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia in 
        March 1939, all the others closed. The Board recognized this at their 
        meeting in June 1939.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The 
        pattern was continually repeated elsewhere, as the German war machine 
        rolled across Europe. In January 1941, the Board recognized the 
        dissolution of the clubs in Estonia (3), Latvia (2), Lithuania (2), 
        Poland (10), Luxembourg (1), Norway and the Netherlands (34). It also 
        meant writing off various payments for goods supplied or per capita 
        taxes due from these closed clubs. In June 1941 following a law passed 
        that country in January 1941, the seven clubs in Bulgaria had their 
        charters cancelled and&nbsp; one year later those in Belgium, Yugoslavia, 
        Greece, Belgium and Roumania followed suit.&nbsp; The effect of all these 
        closures led to some districts being removed from the list and the 
        boundaries of others withdrawn.</span></td>
        <td width="51%" valign="top">
        
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">It was 
        not just the Germans who were repressing Rotary. In Italy the Fascist 
        government of Mussolini also took action against Rotary and in January 
        1939, the Board accepted that District 46, covering Italy, no longer had 
        any active clubs in it and consequently the number was voided.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Next 
        to go was Hungary where most clubs had already closed by the out break 
        of the war but three, Budapest, Pecs and Szeged, had continued to meet. 
        Towards the end of 1941, Szeged stopped functioning, Budapest decided to 
        suspend activities for a year and in view of the situation, the District 
        Governor had resigned his office. By a meeting in June 1942, the Board 
        accepted the position and District 82 and the clubs in it were struck 
        off the list.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">While 
        this was going on in Europe, there were problems for Rotary in the Far 
        East. Even before Pearl Harbor, Japanese activities in China had led to 
        &quot;the advisory committees in Districts 70, 71 and 72 (Japan and the 
        Rotary clubs of Dairen, Pusan, Harbin., Heijyo, Keijo, Mukden and Taikyu) 
        making formal announcements of the disbandment of the Rotary Clubs in 
        the territory comprising thse districts.&quot; (Board minutes January 1941). 
        Of the 48 clubs involved, 31 returned their charters and the remaining 
        17 were reported to be either lost or destroyed. The Board &quot;with deep 
        regret&quot; deleted the three districts and their constituent clubs from the 
        lists. Some Japanese clubs did continue informal meetings throughout the 
        war years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">As 
        happened in Europe with German occupation, the advance of the Japanese 
        armies led to a Board meeting in January 1944 at which the members 
        recognized the position in the Far East. Three more districts, 79, 80 
        and 81, no longer had any functioning clubs and &quot;that there was no 
        prospect of their reorganizing or resuming activity in the near future.&quot; 
        (Board minutes). As a result, the Board terminated the membership of 
        clubs in Borneo, Celebes, Java, Sumatra, the Federated Malay States, 
        Sarawak, the Straits Settlements, Thailand, and The Philippines. 
        Additionally the Board recognized that because of Japanese occupation, 
        four clubs in Burma and a further sixteen in China were no longer able 
        to function as well as ones in Hong Kong and Guam. All were to be 
        deleted from lists of Rotary International clubs. As before, this also 
        meant writing off various payments for goods supplied or per capita 
        taxes due from these closed clubs.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">At the 
        same meeting in January 1944, it was also accepted that all the clubs in 
        that part of France, which had been occupied by the Germans, as opposed 
        to that part which had been under Vichy control, were no longer 
        operative. The board listed 47 such clubs.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">There 
        is one curious omission from these lists of wartime closures. The 
        Germans also occupied the Channel Islands and the clubs there, which 
        were visited by Paul Harris in 1937, were unable to continue meetings 
        until the Germans left the islands.<br>
