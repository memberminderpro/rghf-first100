		<td valign="top" class="auto-style24">In 1937 Paul Harris made a special 
		visit to Britain which he called <br>A POST CONVENTION TOUR OF THE 
		ISLANDS OF THE BRITISH SEAS <br>following the ending of the Convention 
		in Nice. <br>One of the islands was the Isle of Man. This is an account 
		of that visit</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">On July 10, 1937, Paul Harris left 
		Liverpool on the morning boat to the Isle of Man with Will Nixon of the 
		Manchester Club. On arrival in Douglas, Isle of Man, Paul Harris was 
		amused when Nixon rushed off ashore with their luggage, completely 
		missing &quot;the two middle-aged Rotarians wearing roses in their button 
		holes&quot; who were waiting by the gang-plank to greet them! <br><br>Paul 
		Harris' four day visit to the Isle of Man had been meticulously planned 
		by Will Nixon and Fred Gray. Accommodation for their visitor was 
		reserved at the Castle Mona Hotel, formerly the residence of the Duke of 
		Atholl, the last Lord of Man, and there, several Rotarians from the 
		welcoming delegation led by Commander A J Parkes OBE JP, President of 
		the Douglas Club, joined Nixon and Harris for lunch. Immediately the 
		meal was over, Nixon rushed off to catch the afternoon boat back to the 
		mainland. <br><br>Paul Harris was always interested in literary figures, 
		their homes and the places in which their works were set. Here on the 
		Isle of Man, he set out on his first afternoon to follow the trail of 
		the Manx novelist Hall Caine, starting with his grave, a lonely spot far 
		up on the hillsides. It was inscribed:<br><br>'To the memory of Hall 
		Caine, CH KBE, Freeman of Douglas, Manx novelist Born 14th of May 1855 
		Died 31st of August 1931, Slumbering in the deep solitude of the hills 
		he loved so well.' <br><br>As Harris remarked, &quot;His idiosyncrasy was to 
		do his writing in bed, as Victor Hugo's was to do his standing up. What 
		a pity that they did not compromise and both write sitting down.&quot;<br>
		<br>The next day, Sunday July 11, Paul Harris attended an outdoor 
		religious service in a meadow next to Kirk Bradden's 18th century 
		church. These outdoor services are still held today but the congregation 
		of over 10,000 amazed Harris, especially since most were young people. 
		The preacher was the fiancé of the daughter of Commander Parkes and 
		during the next few days, Parkes, the young preacher, and Harris were to 
		meet frequently.<br><br>One evening when they attended a public dance, 
		Harris was again struck by the size of the crowd swaying to and fro &quot;on 
		an acre of hardwood floor&quot;. It was explained to him that many of these 
		were holidaymakers from the Lancashire cotton mills, all of which 
		traditionally closed down at the same time for 'Wakes Week'. Another 
		visit was to Castleton, the island's capital until 1869, and nearby 
		Castle Rushen, variously the jail and the seat of the legislature. It 
		was also the site of an unusual one-hand clock presented by Queen 
		Elizabeth I in 1597. <br><br>He noted that 340 years later the clock 
		still worked and &quot;continues to travel without the slightest sign of 
		gout, rheumatism, lumbago or whatsoever other ailments there may be 
		which pester the lives of aged clocks.&quot; In his diary, Paul Harris noted 
		that the Manx people still had a firm belief that many fairies and 
		witches were supposed to live near Ballalona Bridge. &quot;Tradition has it 
		that they also lived in great numbers in the caves beneath Castle 
		Rushen, but that these had been replaced by giants. I didn't happen to 
		see any of them&quot;, wrote Harris.<br><br>Throughout the President 
		Emeritus's well organised visit to the Isle of Man, he was frequently 
		entertained by local Rotarians among them one of the island's Deemsters 
		or Judges, named Cowley. He was also able to visit a peculiarly British 
		institution, a Council estate, where he visited one of the Rotary Club's 
		special projects, a crêche for working mothers in which they could leave 
		their infants.<br><br>Paul Harris was not sure whether he approved of 
		this project. &quot;The children neither laughed nor smiled,&quot; he wrote. <br>
		<br>For his last evening on the island, the Douglas Club convened a 
		special meeting at the Sefton Hotel on Tuesday July 13, at which their 
		distinguished visitor spoke for nearly an hour about the development of 
		Rotary world wide and his own travels throughout the world. Not for the 
		first time in his speeches to British Rotary clubs, Paul Harris said 
		that, when it was suggested that clubs should be established on this 
		side of the ocean and thereby transform Rotary into an international 
		movement, it was said that the people in Britain were too cold to accept 
		anything so warm as Rotary. But, said Harris, in his boyhood days, he 
		was so curious to see the world on this side of the Atlantic, that he 
		worked his way over on a cattle boat. He had fallen in love with England 
		and her peaceful countryside and had immersed himself in the great 
		literary men, such as Dickens, Thackeray, Shakespeare and Milton. <br>
		<br>He had tramped from end to end of London. From his experience he 
		knew that the doubters were wrong and so a club was started in London to 
		sow the seed for gradual growth. &quot;Our slogan 'Service Without Self' 
		(sic) is expressive of Rotarian philosophy,&quot; the Mona's Herald reported 
		him as saying, &quot;and our doctrine is one of usefulness and friendliness 
		and we believe Rotary has something to offer that is well worth while.&quot; 
		His comments were echoed by Commander Parkes who said that Rotary had 
		made a big contribution towards the solution of social and international 
		problems. Commander Parkes went on to say that he had tried to picture 
		the man who was strong enough to create a Movement which had spread 
		throughout the world to 80 different countries with over 4,000 clubs and 
		178,000 members. &quot;I have thought of a man&quot;, said Parkes, &quot;of intense 
		honesty of purpose, a vigorous courage, and a depth of human sympathy 
		which few of us possess. Since I have come in contact with the man 
		himself, that picture has remained in fact.&quot;<br><br>This extra meeting 
		on the Tuesday had been arranged because the club had previously booked 
		Vice Admiral Sir Gordon Campbell as their guest speaker for their 
		regular lunch meeting the following day. Sir Gordon, who like Paul 
		Harris, had never visited the Isle of Man before, amused his audience 
		with a series of naval reminiscences and anecdotes. He went on in a more 
		serious vein to talk about the need for Britain and the United States to 
		work together to stop aggressive dictators. <br><br>Paul Harris attended 
		this lunch and listened to Sir Gordon's comments. Before leaving, he 
		spoke enthusiastically about the island. &quot;There has never&quot;, he said, 
		&quot;been a greater disparity between expectation and realisation than in 
		the case of this beautiful island. Historically it is vastly interesting 
		and, in men of letters and religion, had contributed much to mankind.&quot; 
		He concluded by expressing the hope that he would have the opportunity 
		to extend the good wishes of Manx people to their kinsfolk in America. 
		Leaving the meeting, he was then taken &quot;under escort by many friends&quot; to 
		the boat for the mainland. Thus ended &quot;four very full and happy days&quot;, 
		he wrote.<br><br>Basil Lewis</td>
