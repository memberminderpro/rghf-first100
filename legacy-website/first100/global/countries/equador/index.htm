		<br>As of 1927, the Club Rotary of Guayaquil has come fulfilling all the 
		rotaries postulates. We need many hours to describe the works that, in 
		benefit of the city, of the province and the country, the institution 
		has made that, in its 76 years of existence has had the fortune to be 
		directed, successively, from Mr. Rodolfo Baquerizo Moreno, its first
