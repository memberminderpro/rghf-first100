		<img class="auto-style26" src="tallberg.jpg" style="float: left">It is appropriate to start this 
		short history of Rotary in Finland from the first club, The Rotary Club 
		of Helsinki- Helsingfors.<br><br>How did it all start?<br><br>The first 
		unofficial rotary meeting was held in Helsinki on August 5 1926.<br><br>
		The invitation to that meeting was made by the president of the Rotary 
		Club of Stockholm, Mr Josef Norén.<br><br>In August 1926 a large YMCA 
		meeting was held in Helsinki-Helsingfors and since there where many 
		Rotarians among the YMCA leaders that had come together Norén wanted 
		them to also have a Rotary meeting and it took place at Hotel Kämp, one 
		of the finest if not the finest hotels and restaurant in town.<br><br>
		There where some 40 Rotarians from different parts of the world 
		attending.<br><br>The meeting was chaired by, Mr. Charles R. Hemingway 
		of Nottingham, England.<br><br>Mr. F.N. Menefee from Michigan, USA was 
		asked to act as secretary. <br><br>Josef Norén was a leading figure in 
		the YMCA-movement in Sweden and therefore also had many contacts to the 
		leaders of YMCA in Finland, among the professor Arthur Hjelt.<br><br>
		Professor Hjelt had recommended certain persons that he considered 
		suitable to become members of the new club to also be invited to the 
		August meeting.<br><br>It was at this August meeting that the torch was 
		lit and on December 1 1926 the founding meeting of the Rotary Club of 
		Helsingfors-Helsinki was held at the Hotel Kämp.<br><br>The meeting was 
		chaired by, Rotary Internationals Special Commissioner for Europe Mr. 
		Fred Warren Teele.<br><br>The first President was professor Bernhard 
		Wuolle and Mr. Paul Thorwall M.Sc. was elected to be the secretary.<br>
		<br>There was a total of 43 people present and they all signed the list 
		of participants in this important meeting. Interestingly the median age 
		of the first members was 45 years.<br><br>The first board was also 
		appointed and the first Club By-Laws were accepted.<br><br>Among the 
		charter members are many influential persons in business and culture.<br>
		<br>Names may not be so important to the reader but some deserve to be 
		mentioned.<br><br>In the first board was Mr. Risto Ryti a 37 year old 
		lawyer who was to become the President of Finland in the difficult year 
		of 1940 and he served until 1944 when he resigned to make way for a 
		other Rotarian namely Marshall of Finland, Baron Carl- Gustaf 
		Mannerheim.<br><br>
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/clubs-of-rips/helsinki/mannerheim.htm" target="_blank">
		<img alt="C.G.E. Mannerheim" class="auto-style27" src="mannerheim9.jpg" style="float: left"></a>Marshall Mannerheim was a honorary member of the 
		Rotary Club of Helsinki - Helsingfors until his death in 1951.<br><br>
		Other influential persons worth mentioning are Axel Solitander, Alvar 
		Niklander, Heikki Reenqvist (Reenpää) and Alfred Paloheimo and many 
		others who held and would later hold important positions in society.<br>
		<br>The Charter of The Rotary Club of Helsingfors- Helsinki is dated 
		January 26. 1927 and signed by then RI President Harry H. Rogers. The 
		Club number assigned to the new club is 2470.<br><br>Finland had become 
		the 34th country in which Rotary was active.<br><br>Naturally, the 
		Rotary idea spread quickly and Turu-Åbo, the old capital (until 1827) 
		had a club in 1929, Wiborg, a trade and industrial centre in the far 
		east part of the country in 1931 and Tampere , an industrial centre in 
		central Finland in 1933.<br><br>Before the outbreak of the Second World 
		War in 1939 a total of eight Rotary Clubs had been chartered and the 
		total membership was 270 Rotarians.<br><br>It may perhaps be interesting 
		to note that the early club in Wiborg or Viipuri was forced to terminate 
		in June of 1944 when the Soviet Union had troops in the city.<br><br>
		Wiborg was first over run by the Soviets in 1940 but reclaimed by the 
		Finns in the summer of 1941.<br><br>During the last summer of the war 
		the Soviet Union concentrated a huge force of men and guns on the 
		Finnish front in June of 1944 with the idea of actually overrunning the 
		country.<br><br>The force was enormous and many say that the 
		concentration of heavy guns was the densest ever collected. There was a 
		heavy gun for every five yards on the Carelian Isthmus.<br><br>The 
		bombardment started and the Finns had to retreat, but in well organised 
		manoeuvres and very heavy fighting. Finally the enemy was stopped just 
		west of the city of Wiborg.<br><br>The minutes of the last meeting on 
		June 12.1944 is laconic and reads as follows:<br><br>§1. There was a 
		discussion about the military situation on the Isthmus, where the enemy 
		had started a major general advance trust.<br><br>§2. There was no 
		presentation.<br><br>§3 The next meeting will be held on June 19 1944 
		with Rotarians Karttunen, Leskinen and Mali to give presentations.<br>
		<br>Not even the signature of the secretary could be obtained to this 
		last protocol.<br><br>The next meeting was never held because the 
		armoured troops of the enemy had rolled into town and the population had 
		been evacuated to other parts of Finland.<br><br>The war ended in 
		September 1944 in a separate peace with The Soviet Union and parts of 
		Eastern-Finland had to be seeded.<br><br>The Rotary Club of Viipuri took 
		up work in Helsinki on January 2 1945 with all the previous members who 
		had not joined other clubs in their new hometowns accepted automatically 
		as members.<br><br>The Rotary Club of Wiborg- Viipuri appeared in the 
		Official Directory for 1945-1946 but with the old address in the then 
		seeded city of Wiborg.<br><br>However Rotary International was of the 
		opinion that, since the Wiborg club had lost its domicile it would not 
		be considered a legal club. Therefore the club decided to send a letter 
		informing RI that it had decided to terminate the membership on May 5 
		1947.<br><br>Strangely RI had also determined that it was not possible 
		to start a new club in Helsinki- Helsingfors and that the former members 
		of Wiborg would have to join the Helsinki Club.<br><br>The development 
		then turned around and in 1948 steps where taken to start a new club 
		under the name of Töölön- Rotaryklubi - Tölö Rotary Club. Again the 
		charter members came from the old club in Wiborg. On May 16 1949 the 
		first meeting of the new club was held and with 18 members present. The 
		charter is dated May 30.1949 and the club has number 10013. The new club 
		was the 48th club in Finland and the second in the city of 
		Helsinki-Helsingfors.<br><br>Of the 29 charter members, 21 had been 
		members of the old club in Wiborg, most of the other charter members 
		also had their roots there.<br><br>This is interesting also from the 
		point of view that a new club was chartered in post war Finland and 
		serves to prove that the Republic was a sovereign state and not a puppet 
		state of the Soviet Union.<br><br>It may perhaps be of interest to the 
		reader to note that Finland was one of the few countries that 
		participated in the Second World War that was not occupied by enemy 
		forces.<br><br>Almost all other countries in Europe and Asia got foreign 
		troops on their soil, (Austria, France, Poland, Italy, Holland, Belgium, 
		Norway, Denmark, Germany, Chechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Jugoslavia, 
		Japan, just to name a few. Of the nations that participated in the war 
		only four capitals, London, Moscow, Helsinki and Washington remained 
		unoccupied.<br><br>It is interesting to note that in the thirties there 
		was a group of people who wanted to stop Rotary in Finland because 
		Rotary was not looked upon favourably in Germany after 1933 when the 
		National Socialists (Nazi) under the leadership of Hitler had 
		established a new type of dictatorial regime.<br><br>Past Governor 
		Herbert Tillander who was Governor in Finland in 1949-50 has noted that 
		no actual motion in that direction was made.<br><br>The war years 
		naturally had a strong impact on Rotary in Finland.<br><br>Many of the 
		members actually had to go into uniform and defend the nation, first in 
		the bloody Winter War of 1939-1940 and then in the second War of 
		1942-1945.<br><br>The war started on November 30 1939 with a major air 
		bombardment of Helsinki and Kotka as well as Turku (ÅBO).<br><br>The 
		Helsinki- Helsingfors club had a meeting on December 5 1939 with only 
		four members attending and the next meeting had only one member in 
		attendance –out of 78 members.<br><br>The club in Turku (ÅBO) had a 
		meeting on January 9.1940 which lasted a record long time, some four 
		hours of which three had to spent in the shelters.<br><br>Finland was a 
		nation that had to mobilize every last grain of resources that could be 
		found.<br><br>When the war started the population was less than four 
		million.<br><br>The South-Eastern district of Carelia was lost in the 
		winter war of 1939-40 and some 415,000 people out of a total population 
		of 3,6 million people had to evacuated and given a new home in the 
		remaining part of the country.<br><br>The army was a pure conscript army 
		and as many as 17 percent of the whole population was mobilised in the 
		defence, that is the highest percentage in the world!<br><br>Good 
		Activity in difficult circumstances<br><br>Even if normal meetings could 
		not be held at all times, Rotary was very active during the war years 
		and after the war.<br><br>The clubs in no way went into hibernation or 
		disbanded, quite on the contrary. The clubs collected supplies and 
		distributed them to people who had lost everything.<br><br>In 1942 the 
		Helsinki Club took 10 children as their godchildren and helped them 
		financially to go to school and later into active work.<br><br>Also a 
		ring of guarantors was created to help gifted but penniless student to 
		pursue their academic studies. This form of help spread quickly to 
		almost all Rotary Clubs in the country.<br><br>It must be born in mind 
		that the nation was in severe difficulties for many years after the war 
		because of the heavy war reparations (300 million US dollars in 1938 
		money) that had to be paid to the Soviet Union. The sum was later 
		reduced to 226,5 million dollars, but calculated on the basis of actual 
		prices and currency values the sum was 445 million dollars.<br><br>This 
		strangled the economy and it was not until the sixties that a well 
		functioning system of economic assistance and an efficient Scandinavian 
		style social security net could be created, on the national level.<br>
		<br>On the other hand the need to create new industry, especially in the 
		field of mechanical engineering, shipbuilding and paper and pulp 
		machinery made a change from a predominantly agricultural society to an 
		industrial and later a post- industrial society possible.<br><br>The 
		problems where compounded by the fact that also a lot of paper and pulp 
		products had to be delivered. That meant that a large part of the 
		traditional foreign trade revenue was lost, there was no money to buy 
		raw materials so badly needed for the reconstruction work of the 
		country.<br><br>The CARE-Program.<br><br>What was the CARE programme?<br>
		<br>CARE comes from, Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe<br>
		<br>After the end of the war in Europe in 1945 The Rotary Foundation and 
		many Clubs and Districts in America helped their European Rotary Fellows 
		by sending many sorts of supplies.<br><br>The Americans had hoped that 
		the material sent should be distributed among the members of the Clubs 
		receiving the parcels and that they should be given gratis.<br><br>What 
		did the Rotary Club of Rovaniemi in the then devastated far north of the 
		country do?<br><br>Yes, they distributed the goods so that all readymade 
		clothes and shoes where given to the municipal home for the elderly and 
		all foodstuffs such as chocolate, tea, coffee and wool yarn and soap war 
		divided into 18 heaps of which each member got one lot.<br><br>The 
		writer can remember the distribution in Heinola a small rural town in 
		Central Finland.<br><br>The Club in Heinola (Chartered 23.01.1946) 
		received a similar parcel.<br><br>I had never seen pineapple, let alone 
		banana and fruit conserves and coconut milk.<br><br>However there was no 
		talk of distributing among the members of the club but everything was 
		given to those who had suffered the most hardships. The Grandmother 
		managed to convince her husband that one of the parcels should be given 
		to the housemaster/driver in the household. OK That was done and if the 
		son of the house had to sneak away to the housemasters´ modest home to 
		see the wonders of the west, and even got to taste the pineapple.<br>
		<br>There is also a story from real life on what was done with the 
		parcels.<br><br>At Kristeinestad RC the parcels got auctioned away at 
		the club meetings.<br><br>Nobody knew beforehand at which meeting the 
		auction was to held and this naturally resulted in a very good 
		attendance.<br><br>Because of this activity the club had considerable 
		monies and could buy many articles that the less fortunate really 
		needed. That was mostly warm clothing and less sweets and chocolate. <br>
		<br>J. SibeliusThe Finns thanked the American Rotarians by many letters 
		but then it was decided that a statue of the famous Finnish composer and 
		Rotarian Jean Sibelius should be placed in the front hall of the Rotary 
		Head Quarters in Chicago. The statue carried a very important symbolic 
		message:<br><br>“THANK YOU ROTARIANS IN AMERICA”. <br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="sibelius.jpg" style="float: left">When on April 
		27 1945 the last German troops had been driven out of the country in the 
		far north, (the Germans retreated into Norway and then gave up on May 5 
		1945 when the war ended in the German capitulation). THE WAR WAS OVER!<br>
		<br>The period from 1945-1955 was a time of rapid expansion of Rotary in 
		Finland.<br><br>When hostilities had stopped there was a period of brisk 
		development of Rotary in Finland.<br><br>On February 1 1945 Jakobstad 
		Rotary Club was chartered followed by Borgå-Porvoo on March 7 1945 and 
		Rauma Rotary Club on April 1 1945. Then there was a new Rotary club 
		almost every month so that in 1949-1950 there where a total of 52 clubs 
		in one district in Finland. <br>In July 1945 Rotary International had 
		5413 clubs and an estimated 245 000 Rotarians in the clubs.<br><br>May 
		1950 it was decided that there should be two districts in Finland. Mr. 
		Oskar Sumelius from Tampere RC was the new District Governor for the 
		western district and Mr. Paapvo Waris from Helsinki became the Governor 
		for the eastern district. Mr. Herbet Tillander a master jeweller was a 
		Past Governor at age 41!<br><br>At the same district conference in 
		Vaasa-Vasa 13-14 May 1950. Marshal of Finland Carl-Gustaf Mannerheim was 
		elected Honorary Governor. Are there any others who have that title?<br>
		<br>In 1949 Rotary International had some 300 000 members worldwide.<br>
		<br>When Rotary International published a Directory for 1945-1946, 
		Finland was the only country to be mentioned of those that had been 
		co-belligerent with Germany in the war that had just ended.<br><br>Of 
		the Nordic countries, Clubs in Sweden and Denmark are also listed but 
		not in Norway or Iceland.<br><br>I have used the term co-belligerent and 
		that may need a bit of explanation but we shall have to leave that to 
		another article. The fact is that Finland was at war with the Soviet 
		Union but did not have any kind of pact or formal alliance with Germany. 
		The factual situation was different and weapons and material were bought 
		from Germany and strategic minerals such as nickel and copper, plus 
		paper and pulp were delivered all the time. German troops also operated 
		in the northern regions of Lappland and Kainuu and troops where 
		transported from the ports in the south to Norway.<br><br>The Germans 
		even had a permanent representative at the High Command in Mikkeli from 
		1941 on.<br><br>We in Finland have tended to downplay the importance of 
		the German troops but especially in the hot summer of 1944 the special 
		air force squadron under the command of Kurt Kuhlmay was very important 
		and highly efficient.<br><br>It is not so well known that the Soviet war 
		effort was assisted by the Americans, particularly from 1942 onwards.<br>
		<br>The US sent guns, ammunition, motor vehicles, food, even boots, some 
		of which ended up in the rucksacks of the Finns when they hit behind the 
		lines.<br><br>Why was there such a large interest in starting Rotary 
		Clubs?<br><br>One should perhaps try to find the answer in the situation 
		after the war.<br><br>When the armistice came, a so called “Control 
		Commission” under the leadership of General Andrei Zdanow arrived on 
		October 5 1944. (Zdanow was one of the most trusted men of Stalin and 
		had a iron will and was absolutely unscrupulous.)<br><br>This commission 
		had members from the UK, France and US among its members.<br><br>The 
		mission was to check to make certain that the Finnish army was disarmed, 
		despite the war still going on in the north against the Germans. <br>
		<br>However the commission also had a tendency to express opinions about 
		the domestic policy,<br>a totally internal Finnish matter.<br><br>It was 
		widely suspected that the Russian delegates also tried to help a 
		communist uprising and change of regime from a democratic western system 
		to a totalitarian soviet regime.<br><br>The years from 1944 to 1948 are 
		often referred to as “The years of Peril” or “Years of Danger”.<br><br>
		The Rotary movement, with its strong roots in the United States and in 
		early entry in Britain, was seen as a gateway to the west, a possibility 
		to create contacts, and to keep a door open to the west- come hell or 
		hale!<br><br>Naturally the ideological basis of Rotary: Freedom, 
		Liberty, Honesty, Truth, Friendship and Brotherhood, all appealed to a 
		nation and to a people who had laid the foundation of their nation on 
		that basis and fought to defend their ideals.<br><br>Helsinki 1952. 
		External view of the Olympic Stadium.It is not an insignificant fact 
		that the hosting of the Olympic Games of 1952 had been given to 
		Helsinki. That happened in 1948 and that put Finland back on the world 
		map again.<br><br>The games of 1940 had been given to Finland but 
		because of the war those could not be arranged.<br><br>Times had changed 
		also in other respects.<br><br>Before the war much of the higher 
		education was brought from Germany.<br><br>Especially that was the case 
		with technology of all sorts, chemistry, mechanical engineering, 
		aviation, machine building etc.<br><br>

		1893. Also literature and the arts was dependent on the contacts to 
		Germany, even if the painters of the “Golden Age of Finnish painting” 
		mostly went to Paris and sometimes also to Holland and Britain.<br><br>
		Now the scales had turned to the Anglo-American side. The victors!<br>
		<br>People wanted to learn to speak English and to make new contacts.
