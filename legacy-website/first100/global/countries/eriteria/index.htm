		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19"  width: 50%>THE BEGINNING (1957 
		&gt;1979)<br><br>Stretching back to mid-Twentieth Century, Rotary has a 
		long history in Eritrea. The first ever movement to organize a Club in 
		Asmara, started soon after the first Club in the region, was established 
		in Addis Ababa, in 1955.<br><br>On 9th May 1957, movement in Eritrea 
		culminated in the founding of the Rotary Club of Asmara and on 18th 
		December of the same year, it was chartered by the Rotary International. 
		The Club had 30 charter Members, and was part of District 220.<br><br>
		THE BANNER<br><br>The Club had adopted a banner with the design to suit 
		the times: Rotary Wheel at the top center, with a then emblem of the 
		Municipality of Asmara, printed between the wordings- ROTARY CLUB OF 
		ASMARA ETHIOPIA- written in red; Trigrigna between the wheel and the 
		emblem, and English below the emblem. The emblem of the Municipality 
		itself, was having a Crown sitting on the heraldry Crest of sea and 
		mountains with an image of the Lion of Juddah at the bottom. On each 
		side of the Crown and the Crest, were branches of maize and berries. 
		Green, yellow and red ribbons that represented the Ethiopian flag 
		surrounded the banner printed on a white background.<br><br>THE MEETINGS<br>
		<br>The Club had its humble beginnings in 1957, at the C.I.A.A.O Hotel ( 
		later Selam Hotel) and regularly held weekly meetings on Thursdays at 
		1:15 p.m. ( 13:15 hrs. ) with a three course sit-down luncheon.<br><br>
		In 1968, the venue of the meetings was shifted to the newly built 
		Imperial Hotel ( later Amba Soira Hotel) and met on the same days and 
		time.<br><br>Since Rotary in those days did not allow female gender to 
		become members, from 1966 onwards the Club decided to hold last meeting 
		of each month, for a dinner with ladies starting at 8:45 p.m. and the 
		rest of the weekly meetings were held at usual times for lunch.<br><br>
		Such meetings with ladies, became quite popular with more than 100 
		people sitting down together for a dinner each month.<br><br>GALA 
		DINNER-DANCE NIGHTS<br><br>Twice a year, the Club organized gala 
		dinner-dances, in a formal Black-Tie attire with live music band. 
		Besides being entertaining, the purpose used to serve to raise some 
		funds for the Club’s various projects through lotteries and auctions.<br>
		<br>The President usually gave a speech on the Club’s achievements, but 
		not other regular meeting features were carried out. Rotary 
		dinner-dances used to be extremely popular and would usually end in the 
		wee-hours of the morning.<br><br>It was recorded in the Club bulletin 
		that the Dinner-Dance held at KAGNEW station in May 1966 had total 
		attendance of 335 people and revelry went on till 3:30 in the morning.<br>
		<br>THE MEMBERSHIP<br><br>From the modest membership of 30 in 1957, the 
		Club grew rapidly. By early 1960s, it doubled to 60. In December 1965, 
		it stood close to 100 and within next one year it surpassed 104.<br><br>
		The membership reached its pinnacle with 126 members in July 1973, the 
		highest among 42 Clubs in District 220.<br><br>The Club had a good 
		cross-section of all communities represented from the business and 
		professional sectors and different nationalities. Italian nationals 
		formed a majority membership with Eritreans following it.<br><br>
		Moreover, there were Americans, British, Indians, Greeks, French and 
		Germans as well - that made the Club a truly international assemblage.<br>
		<br>Owing to such a large membership, District 220 constantly persuaded 
		the Club to split in two or more Rotary Clubs within the city of Asmara. 
		The Club however, resisted such proposals. In 1973/74, the matter was 
		put to the floor for a vote by the members and was overwhelmingly 
		rejected.<br><br>Curiously enough from the statistical point of view, 
		the global membership of RI in 1966, was 12,521 Clubs with 600,200 
		Rotarians in 133 countries. While by early 1974, there were 15,800 Clubs 
		with 747,000 Rotarians in 150 countries.<br><br>WEEKLY MEETINGS<br><br>
		One of the most distinguished speakers of the time, invited by the Club 
		was the famous French marine explorer and inventor of the under-water 
		‘Aqualung’ gear, Monsieur Jacques Coustaux. He gave a fascinating speech 
		on his research and exploration of the Red Sea marine life in 1968. Upon 
		his invitation, Rotarians visited his famous ship ‘Calypso’ anchored in 
		Massawa.<br><br>Among other speakers and programmes, the Club organized 
		film and slide shows, painting exhibitions, concerts, outings to some 
		industries and to the U.S. Base T.V station, children’s Christmas 
		parties etc.<br><br>CHARITY PROJECTS<br><br>Little of the history of the 
		Club survives to record all the humanitarian projects carried out by the 
		Club in 20 years of its existence. I is however, well recorded in the 
		surviving Club bulletins some of the projects carried out by the Club.<br>
		<br>* Funds were given to Y.W.C.A., the Blinds School and the Children’s 
		Home.<br><br>* Donations were made for the construction of Maereba 
		School and doors/windows were provided to a school in Seraie.<br><br>* 
		Contribution was made for the Blood Bank in Asmara. One blind person was 
		sent to Italy at the Club’s expenses for an eye operation, while five 
		children were sent to U.S.A. at Rotary’s expenses for correctional 
		open-heart surgery.<br><br>* More than 8,000 U.S. Dollars worth 
		contribution was mad for the Famine Relief in 1974.<br><br>* 
		International Service Committee launched a project ‘Bounty of Knowledge’ 
		importing library books from around the world, and donated to the 
		libraries in Asmara.<br><br>* The Club invited a world-class pianist 
		Prof. Julien Bern ( a professor of music from Cornel college, U.S.A.) 
		and organized a Piano concert in Odeon cinema to raise fund for the 
		benefit of the blind children of Eritrea. The event was a highlight of 
		the time.<br><br>THE ROTARY CLUB OF MASSAWA<br><br>By about 1966/67, it 
		was felt that the timing and climate was right to establish another Club 
		in Eritrea. Thus, the rotary Club of Massawa was sponsored by the Asmara 
		Club and was given charter by the RI.<br><br>The Club met at the Red Sea 
		Hotel and held regular weekly meetings day other than Thursdays so that 
		the Rotarians of both the clubs of Asmara and Massawa could ‘make-up’ 
		their lost attendances in other Club.<br><br>No records are available to 
		verify when exactly the Club was established and when it was closed 
		down. It is presumed that Rotary Club of Massawa was abandoned around 
		the same time the Club in Asmara was discontinued.<br><br>END OF AN ERA<br>
		<br>Due to atrocities that began by the Ethiopa’s Dergue regime, 
		starting February 1975, the Club suffered loss of membership and 
		intermittent cancellations of meetings. Remnant of members tried to 
		continue the Club’s activities with its meagre resources. The Club as an 
		entity was finally abandoned some time in 1977. The last President known 
		to have presided was Rtn. Beyene Debessai. Owing to lack of information, 
		RI struck-out the membership of the Rotary Club of Asmara, Ethiopia, 
		from its registers and the Charter was withdrawn on March 31, 1979.<br>
		<br>All that was done and achieved by the Club was wiped out. The 
		Records and property of the Club were lost forever due to displacement 
		of members and material. For the next 20 years, Rotary remained 
		non-existent in Eritrea.<br><br>EPILOGUE<br><br>The rotary Club of 
		Asmara, Eritrea, is indebted to members of the previous Club, Rtn. 
		Kflemariam Zerom, Rtn. Beyene Debessai, Rtn. Embaie Ifter, Rtn. Yohannes 
		Berhane, Rtn. Manue Premjee and many others who were the sources of 
		information, based on which the history of the Totary Club of Asmara, 
		Ethioia was pieced together.<br><br>The Club’s particular thanks go to 
		Rtn. Kiflemariam Zerom and Rtn Manu Premjee, who steadfastly and 
		relentlessly had a strong forsight keeping a number of former Club 
		Bulletins, some photographs and other documents in their possession. For 
		more than 20 years it was Rtn. Manu Psremjee’s intuitions and conviction 
		that many lost items of the Club’s properties were recovered from what 
		seemed to be a lost case.<br><br>THE NEW BEGINNING (1977)<br><br>After 
		independence on May 28, 1992, a group of former Rotarians met at Amba 
		Soira Hotel, discussed and agreed to revive the RCA. These were:<br>1. 
		Ato Embaye Ifter, former President;<br>2. Ato Beyene Debessai, former 
		President;<br>3. Dr. Yohannes Berhane, former Director “A”;<br>4. Kegn 
		Gheremedhin Tesemma, former Director “C”;<br>5. Kegn Araya Hagos, former 
		Chairman Membership Committee;<br>6. Ato Tesfai Woldemichael, former 
		Chairman Public Relation Committee.<br>To this effect several contacts 
		were made with the Rotary Clubs of Nairobi, Zurich and Rotary 
		International till July 30, 1993.<br><br>Intensive correspondence was 
		made between Ato Beyene Yifter representing the organizing committee for 
		the formation of Rotary Club in Asmara and Ibrahim Ahmado chairman, 
		Rotary club of Utumishi, Nairobi.<br><br>Ahmado was special 
		representative for the formation of Rotary Club of Asmara appointed by 
		DG Abdul Samji of District 9200 (1992 – 1993). Ahmado visited Asmara in 
		April 1993 and had a couple of meetings with the ex-Rotarians whose 
		names listed above including Ato Kiflemariam Zerom.<br><br>On March 6, 
		1996 Rotarian Stephen R. Brown, DG 5340 ( 1996 – 1997), having some 
		information about the existence of a Rotary Club in Asmara long before 
		liberation, wrote to Ato Kiflemariam Zerom asking him for some helpful 
		information in order to establish the Club, including names and 
		addresses of prospective members. On June 8, 1996 Rtn. Brown came to 
		Asmara and held a meeting with some potential members at Ambassador 
		Hotel.<br><br>All these combined efforts contributed to the return of 
		Rotary to Eritrea.<br><br>The first Official Club Meeting to establish 
		RCA was held on April 22, 1997 at Selam Hotel. At that time The Club 
		Constitution was adopted and Charter Officers of the Club were elected 
		as follows:<br>1. Berhe Tekie President<br>2. Girmay Haile Secretary<br>
		3. Omer Berhanu Treasurer<br>4. Beyene Debessai Director, CSA<br>5. 
		Eyassu Asfah Director, VSC<br>6. Daniel Haile Director, CSC<br>7. 
		Yohannes Berhane Director, ISC<br>8. Dawit Mahray Assistant Secretary<br>
		<br>On April 30, 1997, the Board of Directors of RCA laid down all the 
		legal and technical procedures required for the official recognition of 
		the RCA by the Government of Eritrea.<br><br>The RCA was officially 
		recognized by the Government on May 19, 1997 and by the Rotary 
		International on August 11 the same year. RCA was admitted to Rotary 
		International (RI) on Sept. 14, 1997 as number 157 in the RI register.<br>
		<br>It was sponsored by the Rotary Club of Mombassa, Kenya.<br><br>On 
		November 4, 1997 the Club by-laws were adopted. It was then that the 
		weekly Club meeting time was changed from 12:30 to 7:00 P.M. On November 
		16, 1997 charter ceremony of RCA was held at the Sham-Rock Café with the 
		presence of DG 9200, three PDGS, one DGN 9200, 15 members RC of 
		Mombassa, visiting and RCA rotary Anns, government ministers, Lord Mayor 
		of Asmara and other invited guests.<br><br>At this time the Club banner 
		was also launched.<br><br>FORMER MEMBER RETURNS TO ERITREA<br><br>In may 
		1997, one of the former members, past Rotarian Manu Premjee returned to 
		free Eritrea. He happened to be an active member of that Club from 1960 
		till 1975. He had served the former Club in various capacities; more 
		than once as Director, as Chairman in different Committees, as an 
		Assistant Secretary, twice as Secretary and once as Vice President 
		during his 15 years of Club’s membership. He was also an initiator and 
		editor of the monthly Club bulletin – ASMARA ROTOR.<br><br>UREKA<br><br>
		In his personal capacity, Manu quietly initiated an inquiry with the 
		Emba Soira Hotel’s management. He met the Manager and asked for his 
		goodwill to allow him inspect various strange places of the hotel. It 
		took several days of insistent coaxing to gain<br>entry to ‘staff only’ 
		area of the hotel. Finally, Manu was led by the manager to the down 
		stairs facilities.<br><br>The patient negotiations paid–off when he 
		found ‘ROTARY MEETS HERE’ wall plague - out of all places, from the 
		laundry room. The manager was now more cooperative and Manu more 
		aggressive towards the cause.<br><br>He told the manager, “If one item 
		is found all other items must be located from other stores”.<br><br>
		Further investigation revealed that a few years earlier, unwanted items 
		of the hotel was shifted to Selam Hotel. The store keeper in charge of 
		Selam Hotel was introduced but, he was reluctant to allow inspection by 
		any outsiders.<br><br>It took a month to obtain his approval. Towards 
		the end of July ’97, he accompanied Manu to Selam Hotel.<br><br>There, a 
		small shack with two rooms located in the back-yard corner of the hotel 
		was opened. Rooms were unlit and mish-mash of items heaped to the 
		ceiling in disorderly manner, impossible to inspect.<br><br>Manu looked 
		for a tell-tale sign for anything ROTARY and soon saw yellow/blue end of 
		the RI drapery, partly hanging out of a carton.<br><br>Ten IR drapes 
		ordered from USA in 1960s were found in excellent condition.<br><br>
		Another carton revealed some one hundred ‘dusty’ membership Badges – 
		still with name tags of all Rotarians of the past.<br><br>Without lights 
		and manpower needed to sift through the mess, further investigation was 
		impossible. The store-keeper was least interested to allow further 
		intrusion for a systematic scrutiny of the messy rooms.<br><br>The 
		Rotary Club of Asmara continues to prosper to this day.<br><br>This 
		history extracted from the Club's web site with appreciation to the 
		members.</td>
