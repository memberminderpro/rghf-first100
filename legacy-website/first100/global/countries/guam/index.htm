						<font size="2">The first Rotary Club in the world was 
						organized by Paul P. Harris, a young lawyer, on February 
						23, 1905, in Chicago, with the object of encouraging and 
						fostering the ideal of service as a basis of worthy 
						enterprise. From its humble birth, Rotary quickly found 
						appeal to business men in countries outside the United 
						States, while it continued to develop and expand within 
						the United States of America.
						<p>In 1910, Rotary spread to Canada, and in 1911-12 to 
						England, Ireland and Scotland, in 1916-18 to Cuba and 
						Puerto Rico, and in 1919 to the Philippines. </p>
						<p>It seems only fitting that in 1939, twenty years 
						after Rotary had spread to the Philippines, that on 8 
						June 1939, Messrs Justice Jose M. Flores and C.C. 
						Butler, two prominent businessmen of Guam, met with 
						Carlos P. Romulo, director and Past Vice-President of 
						Rotary International on his way from the Philippines to 
						the Rotary International Convention in Cleveland, Ogio 
						to make a preliminary survey of the possibilities for 
						organizing a Rotary Club on Guam. This was after 
						preliminary inquiries had been made with local business 
						leaders in 1938, as to whether there would be an 
						interest in establishing a Rotary Club on Guam. </p>
						<p>Past Vice-President of Rotary International, Carlos 
						P. Romulo, reported the results of the survey to the 
						Board of Directors of Rotary International, and, on his 
						return trip to Manila on 4 July 1939, the provisional 
						Rotary Club of Guam was organized by him in the house of 
						Justice Jose M. Flores with Mr. C. C. Butler as Acting 
						of &quot;Ray&quot; Reynolds of the Manila Club, all necessary 
						papers were perfected and the application for membership 
						was sent to Rotary International in Chicago by Pan 
						American Clipper. </p>
						<p>On 30 August 1939, the Rotary Club of Guam was 
						admitted as a member of Rotary International as Club No. 
						5105, and the original Charter was issued and signed by 
						Walter D. Head, President of Rotary International and 
						Chester R. Perry, Secretary of Rotary International, on 
						that date. </p>
						<p align="center">
						<img alt="Rotary Charter Ceremony" src="1939c.jpg" border="0" width="438" height="296"></p>
						<p>The presentation of the Charter to the Rotary Club of 
						Guam was made on the 21st of October 1939 by then 
						Justice of the Philippine Supreme Court, George Malcolm, 
						an active Rotarian from Manila, who was enroute from the 
						Philippines to the U.S. mainland via the now famous 
						California Clipper; this day accordingly, became Charter 
						Day for the Rotary Club of Guam. </p>
						<p>While details of the Charter Day presentation, like 
						so many of the early records of the club have been 
						destroyed by ravages of time, the devastation of war and 
						the severe typhoons which visit our island, it is easy 
						for anyone who has had the privilege of attending a 
						local fiesta, rich Spanish and Chamorro tradition to 
						visualize what a gala occasion this must have been. </p>
						<p>From the records which have come down to us, we know 
						that the ceremonies included a presentation speech by 
						Justice Malcolm, a response by Mr. C. C. Butler, the 
						first President of the Guam Rotary Club and a banquet at 
						the then George Washington Auditorium at Maite, 
						featuring local entertainment. </p>
						<p>From the initial 20 charter members, the membership 
						grew to 29 when Guam was occupied by the Japanese on 8 
						December 1941. </font></td>

						you desire to be one of the outstanding business men, be 
						optimistic. Have faith and confidence in the 
						administration of the Naval Government of Guam. It is 
						amazing what it has done here in the past 40 years. 
						Knowing what it has done gives me confidence.
						<p>&quot;As I look back of the 29 years I have been in Guam, 
						I can see wonderful changes, especially in the business 
						field. I remember when I first came here, there were 
						very few Chamorro people in business. A German, by the 
						name of Costenoble, had a chain of stores - eight, I 
						believe in all - and, there were a few Japanese people 
						with stores. Today, most all of the business houses are 
						conducted by citizens of Guam. Education brought this 
						about. In the old days, Spanish coppers and Mexican 
						dollars were in circulation. The exchange value on the 
						coppers were 4 for one American penny, and the Mexican 
						dollar 50 cents. One seldom sees these coppers and 'Mex' 
						dollars now. And at that time one could exchange a plug 
						of old Navy chewing tobacco for twice its value in 
						merchandise. That was in the bartering days. The old 
						coins have gradually disappeared and the Navy tobacco is 
						slowly disappearing from the stores. </p>
						<p>&quot;During those days, Army Transports brought out 
						commercial cargo every month, free of charge, and the 
						shipments came in a very good condition, with the 
						exception of an occasional barrel of beer being lost. 
						But at that it was very convenient for the few merchants 
						to receive shipments, and they could depend on it 
						monthly. </p>
						<p>&quot;There were no automobiles or trucks. Bull carts and 
						one or two dray wagons were the only means of 
						transportation from Piti to Agana, and bull carts, as 
						you all know, are slow. But of course there was not much 
						cargo brought in at that time. It would look odd, 
						indeed, to see bull carts hauling freight now. </p>
						<p>&quot;The old Customs house, built in 1911, housed both 
						Government and commercial freight. The present Customs 
						house, when built, was believed to be amply large enough 
						to stow all shipments for many years to come. But it was 
						not long before this Customs house became too small for 
						commercial goods. Sooner or later an addition will have 
						to be added to this one. </p>
						<p>&quot;As I look at business today, I recall all these 
						facts of the past. But I can see prosperous years ahead. 
						In fact, I have seen nothing but prosperous years since 
						I have been in Guam. It can be nothing else -- barring 
						wars and catastrophes. Why? Because, besides the 
						government's close cooperation with businessmen, 
						health conditions have improved, so much so that 
						epidemic of dysentery, measles, typhoid fever and the 
						like, that formally (sic) killed people off by the 
						hundreds, are almost a thing of the past. And this is 
						all to the credit of the Naval Government. The 
						population of Guam has been on the increase, year by 
						year. The population has more that doubled during the 
						past 20 years. </p>
						<p>&quot;An increase in population encourages the opening of 
						new business enterprises. In ten years from now, I 
						believe we are going to see unbelievable business 
						improvement. Memories recall many commercial ventures 
						some of which are, The Bank of Guam; Pedro's Ice and 
						Cold Storage Plant; Bordallo's Cold Storage Plant; 
						Torres' Soap Factory; Photo Shops; Restaurants; 
						Refreshment places; Barber Shops; Bakeries; Taxi Cabs; 
						Bus Lines; a Saw Mill; the Globe Wireless, the Weaving 
						Industry, the Tile Factory, up-to-date dry goods and 
						grocery stores, (such as Flores Trading Co., Calvo's 
						stores and Atkins Kroll &amp; Co.); Pan American Airways and 
						naturally last but not least my bottling plant. </p>
						<p>&quot;And there are other enterprises which are bound to 
						grow up here in time to come. Let me mention a few. 
						There is the dairy business, a laundry and dry cleaning 
						establishment, an electric light plant, a hotel, a 
						brewery, a steamship company, a telephone co., a life 
						insurance co., a dentist and perhaps an eye, ear, nose 
						and throat specialist. There are but a few, but, I 
						believe there are openings for these few at this time. 
						We have the Bank of Guam ready to finance anyone with a 
						good proposition, and the people of Guam should be the 
						ones to start these enterprises before outsiders 
						discover their possibilities. </p>
						<p>&quot;As the population increases, people will find ways 
						and means of earning a living. That is but natural. 
						Believe in your government and don't worry over hard 
						times. As new business firms are established there is 
						opened up new classification for membership, and 
						naturally, the Rotary Club will benefit. And the island 
						will benefit the merchants and all concerned. </p>
						<p>&quot;I believe it is up to the Rotarians to promote new 
						enterprises -- there being no Chamber of Commerce here 
						to do it. As a business and professional men we must 
						feel it our duty to work for the community interests, 
						and a new line of business is of interest to this 
						community.&quot; </font></td>
