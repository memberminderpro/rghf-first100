		The Establishment<br>
		<br>The story of how the Rotary Club of Dili came into being, crosses 
		the whole gamut of Human experiences: - Warfare, International Intrigue, 
		Diplomacy, Human Suffering, but above all Rotary International's 
		definition &quot;of an organization of business and professional leaders 
		united Worldwide who provide humanitarian service&quot;. All of the above 
		played a significant part in welcoming Timor Leste (East Timor) into the 
		Rotary Family.<br><br>A pre-amble to this must include some reference to 
		the Peoples of this Country. At a time when the Bretons of France and 
		Great Briton were raising their stone Monuments to the sky, a another 
		race of Megalithic Stone Builders had made their way down to the Island 
		at the end of an archipelago that we now call Timor.<br><br>Successive 
		migrations infused the People of this Island with great skills such as 
		Weaving, Forging Metal, Agriculture, as well as maintaining seafaring 
		skills that saw trade with Australian Aboriginals carried out on an 
		annual Basis.<br><br>Dutch and Portuguese traders arrived in the 16th 
		Century and by 1564 had established settlements and trading posts. This 
		growth in Trade over a period of several hundred years ultimately led to 
		the domination and subjugation of these people. It was from Timor that 
		the Dutch and Portuguese Explorers learned of the great empty land to 
		the South East and from here that they set out to chart it. It was also 
		at Kupang, West Timor that Captain William Bligh made his landfall after 
		completing his epic journey of <br>3000 km after being set adrift by the 
		crew of the Bounty.<br><br>The problems of the last few years are a 
		continuation of the pre-colonial proud warrior culture and the 
		domination by Colonial powers over the last 500 Years. Hopefully the 
		Peoples of Timor Leste can now take their place peacefully among the 
		Nations of the World.<br><br>The catalyst that provided an opportunity 
		to achieve independence arose with the decision by the Indonesian 
		Government to allow a poll to decide if Self-Government was desirable. 
		An overwhelming yes vote was recorded, laying the groundwork for Months 
		of bitter and bloody fighting.<br><br>Prior to Australian and New 
		Zealand Forces restoring order under Major General Peter Cosgrove, 
		Elements of pro Indonesian sympathizers laid waste to People and 
		Property. This damage was reciprocated when control was restored, 
		resulting in up to 80% of buildings both Administrative and Domestic 
		being totally destroyed.<br><br>My first endeavor to introduce Rotary 
		into Timor Leste occurred at the International Assembly, Anaheim, 
		California, February 2000. This was conveyed to the then President of RI 
		Carlo Ravizza by our Zone Director. I was told in no uncertain terms not 
		to &quot;touch it with a 10 foot pole&quot; as Rotary had plans for further 
		introduction into Moslem Countries, and they didn't want a mere District 
		Governor upsetting the applecart.<br><br>Further correspondence from the 
		&quot;South West Service Centre&quot; gave further proof that the issue of Timor 
		Leste, was of an extremely sensitive nature and, that seeing this 
		Country was still within District 3400, Indonesia, it was inappropriate 
		for Rotarians from another District, to be attempting to form a Club in 
		another's Territory.<br><br>Being someone who believed in doing things 
		rather than be told why they couldn't be done, numerous discussions with 
		the Wibowa Kusamadi District Governor of 3400, Indonesia 2000-2001, 
		resulted in a letter dated 10th July 2000, stating that he approved of 
		my idea to establish a new Rotary Club in Dili, and such Club be 
		assigned to District 9550, Australia.<br><br>After completion of visits 
		to Rotary Clubs in the Darwin Area, I flew to East Timor accompanied by 
		Three (3) Rotarians from Darwin. On the evening 30th July 2000, I 
		addressed a Meeting of approximately 20 People, comprising Business, 
		Medical, Aid Service Personnel and Interested Local leaders.<br><br>
		After explaining the Goals and Ideals of Rotary International, I then 
		proceeded to outline what Rotary could do to help alleviate the 
		suffering that had occurred in Timor Leste and the benefits that would 
		accrue from joining this International Family. The response was 
		favourable and immediate. An interest Rotary Club would be formed with 
		the goal of coordinating incoming aid, with the long-term goal being to 
		provide a Service Club for Timorese run by Timorese.<br><br>An 
		interesting aside to our trip to Timor Leste was provided by the fact 
		that the Light Plane we flew in, crashed 2 Weeks after killing the sole 
		occupant. No reason has been advanced for this tragic accident, apart 
		from the fact that control was lost at a height of about 10,000 ft. 
		There were some very relieved Rotarians who fully appreciated just how 
		tenuous life could be.<br><br>Next followed the problem of how to bring 
		this to fruition. The simplest solution would be to enact a change of 
		boundaries, Re-districting being in vogue during this period, but not 
		favoured by RI at the time. What followed was to some extent, a 
		combination of both treating it as an extension into a non Rotary 
		Country and at the same time gaining permission from D3400 to allow a 
		new Club to be created within their District.<br><br>Over the next nine 
		months there followed numerous discussions and reams of correspondence 
		with my counterpart in Indonesia, Wibowa Kusamadi, RI Director Kenneth 
		Collins, The Board of Rotary International, Secretary of RI Edwin H. 
		Futa, The Rotary Club of Darwin, My Extension Representative, Ray 
		Fauntleroy, The Honourable Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, 
		Alexander Downer and the Transitional Administrator of United Nations 
		Transitional Authority East Timor.<br><br>Arising from all this, We had 
		gained the wholehearted support from D3400 Indonesia, 100% support from 
		all Rotary Clubs in D9550, Australia, a Letter from UNTAET welcoming the 
		establishment of a Rotary Club in Dili, Support from the Australian 
		Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Vigorous support from RI 
		Director Kenneth Collins and events appeared to be going favourably.<br>
		<br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/countries/timor/timorlesteppconroyfrankandgwendarveviza.jpg" style="float: left">Amongst the rules governing the extension of Rotary into new 
		Countries are several criteria that have to be met prior to approval 
		being given. First and foremost amongst these are that there has to be a 
		Democratically Elected Government, secondly Rotary has to be invited in 
		by the head of such Government.<br><br>At this stage, I think RI was 
		becoming a bit concerned about developments between D9550 and Timor 
		Leste. Our District Conference at Mission Beach was honoured to have as 
		the personal Representative of R.I President Frank Devlyn, RI Vice 
		President Louis Piconi.<br><br>Witnessing the total support and approval 
		expressed at Conference for my Actions with regard to the formation of a 
		RC in Dili, Louis Piconi became an ardent supporter and I believe was 
		largely instrumental in forthcoming events.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/countries/timor/timorlestedilifirstmeeting.jpg" style="float: left">Initial Approval was 
		given in the dying stages of 2000-2001 by the Board of Rotary 
		International to agree to the Chartering of a Rotary Club in Dili, Timor 
		Leste when all necessary criteria was addressed.<br><br>Despite being 
		welcomed by the UN Transitional Government, We had to wait until results 
		were posted following General Elections 21st August 2001. This being 
		effected, the UN ceased its administrative role in early 2002.<br><br>
		All that remained was for the newly Independent Government to elect a 
		Head and when Xanama Gusmao filled that position, the long awaited 
		invitation went out to Rotary International and it is now history that 
		the Rotary Club of Dili, received its Charter on September 11th 2002 
		with 32 Members.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/countries/timor/TimorLestechildren.jpg" style="float: left">Although some 29 Months elapsed between Genesis 
		and Chartering, I believe that Rotary International are to be 
		congratulated for the controlled manner in which it was done. I would 
		like to pay Tribute to RI President Bichai Rattakul for expediting this 
		approval, To PRIP Clem Renouf for his support, to RI Director Kenneth 
		Collins and VPRI Louis Piconi all of whom played a significant part in 
		the Chartering of the RC Dili.<br><br>Lastly I must pay Tribute to the 
		then Governor of D3400, Wibowa Kusamadi who had the unenviable task of 
		gaining his District's approval to excise Timor Leste from their 
		Territory. To my personal representative on the ground, PP Darwin Club 
		Ray Fauntleroy who worked unstintingly to achieve the Charter and to my 
		two successors PDG Terry Lees and DG Jeffrey Crofts who both took over 
		the baton and carried it to the finishing line with great success, Jeff 
		had the privilege of presenting the Charter on November 30th 2002.<br>
		<br>The prolonged gestation period was due to the fact that although 
		Timor Leste was an Independent Nation it did so under the auspices of 
		the United Nations, and until it achieved a Government and Recognised 
		leader, the Members of the Interest Club of Dili operated as Rotarians 
		in everything but name.<br><br>President of Rotary International 
		2000-2003, Frank Devlyn asked Rotarians the World over to Create 
		Awareness and take Action. Given his inspired Leadership, all Rotarians 
		involved in the Charter of the Rotary Club of Dili, Timor Leste, 
		fulfilled this obligation by Creative Action and putting Service above 
		Self.<br><br><br>Past District Governor 9550 <br>Frank Darveniza
