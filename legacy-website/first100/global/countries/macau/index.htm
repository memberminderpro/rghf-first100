				MACAU AND ITS ACHIEVEMENT</center></font><hr></center>
				<font size="2">
				<p align="left">The idea of setting up a Rotary Club in Macau 
				was raised for the first time in 1938. However, due to the 
				Pacific War, the idea did not become a reality at that time. In 
				1946 when Macau and Hong Kong began to recover from the effects 
				of the 2nd World War, the idea of forming a club in Macau was 
				resurrected. </p>
				<center>
				<p align="left">Henrique Nolasco Jr., a resident of Macau, was 
				invited to attend the weekly meeting of the Hong Kong Rotary 
				Club. He was very impressed by the fellowship and the ideals of 
				Rotary. On his return to Macau, urged on by his enthusiasm, 
				meetings were held with the then District Governor (DG) Arthur 
				Woo and others who gave their assistance and advice for setting 
				up a Club. On 11th January, 1947, a dinner was held at the Fat 
				Siu Lau Restaurant at which the 36 founding members appointed 
				their first Board of Directors. The Rotary Club of Macau was 
				thus formed and began functioning as a provisional club. </p>
				<center>
				<p align="left">Though still lacking official recognition by 
				Rotary International, the provisional club set its course to 
				fulfill the ideals of Rotary by creating ³The Welfare Fund of 
				the Rotary Club of Macau² which was to help many worthy causes 
				in our community such as Homes for the Destitute and Aged, the 
				Portuguese Red Cross, the inhabitants of Taipa and Coloane, the 
				Canossian Institute, The Salesian Orphanage, Peng Man School, 
				Kiang Wu Hospital, The Tong Sin Tong Association, primary and 
				commercial schools and the S. Rafeal Hosptial Maternity Wing. 
				The Rotary Children¹s Library was also set up for the primary 
				school children. </p>
				<center>
				<p align="left">On 16th June 1947 the Rotary Club of Macau 
				received official recognition from the Rotary International and 
				was chartered as Club No. 6662 with the then District 57. On 
				12th and 14th March, 1949, Macau had the honour of being the 
				venue of a District Conference which was attended by hundreds of 
				Rotarians from the 12 clubs in the Far East. During the 1950-51 
				Rotary Year, The Rotary Club of Macau had the privilege of 
				having its Past President Pedro G. Lobato elected District 
				Governor. In this capacity he attended the Rotary International 
				Convention in Detroit, USA. </p>
				<center>
				<p align="left">In 1951, as of result of the concerted efforts 
				of all Rotarians united in the ideal of service, the Rotary Club 
				of Macau opened the ³Lara Reis Anti-Cancer Clinic². It was 
				located at ³Sol Poente², the residence of the late Rotarian 
				Fernando Lara Reis who had bequeathed it in his will to the 
				Portuguese Welfare Organization Santa Casa da Misericórdia which 
				subsequently administered the Clinic. </p>
				<center>
				<p align="left">In the beginning of the 1951-52 Rotary Year, 
				political changes in China affected all the Rotary Clubs in the 
				area District 57. Only four clubs from District 57 remained ­ 
				Hong Kong, Kowloon, Macau and Taipei. Being too few in number to 
				form a district, they composed an area under an Administrative 
				Advisor nominated by Rotary International. The situation was 
				brought back to normal when District 345, to which Macau 
				belonged, was created several years later. In 1988, District 
				3450 was formed, with Hong Kong and Macau being a separate 
				district from Taiwan. </p>
				<center>
				<p align="left">The Rotary Club of Macau has been the meeting 
				place for a wide cross section of Macau society, encompassing 
				people of various professions and nationalities. A survey of 
				members indicates that the Club¹s members today are made up of 
				11 nationalities, who can speak a total of 16 languages. This is 
				why, for many years now, English has been adopted as the working 
				language for the Club meetings and proceeding. </p>
				<center>
				<p align="left">In the 70¹s, the development of Macau led to 
				growth in the Rotary movement here. New clubs were established, 
				the Rotary Club of Hou Kuong was chartered in 1979, the Rotary 
				Club of Macau Central in 1984, the Rotary Club of Amagao in 
				1986, the Rotary Club of Guia in 1993 and Rotary Club of Macau 
				Islands in 1997. </p>
				<center>
				<p align="left">As mentioned earlier, the Rotary Club of Macau 
				has always shown a strong awareness of the needs of Macau and 
				has contributed much of its capabilities to meet those needs 
				through community projects. In the 60¹s, assistance was given in 
				building a reservoir at the Ka Ho Leper Colony and in building 
				and setting up of fully equipped vocational training workshops 
				at the Boy¹s Home which at the time was being run by the Macau 
				Police Force. In the 70²s and 80¹s, the Club was involved in the 
				construction of new shower rooms for the orphan¹s dormitories at 
				the São Jos? School in Ka Ho. Many smaller projects have also 
				been carried out including the provision of bus shelters, 
				children¹s playgrounds, donations and scholarships to students 
				in need, subsidies to school canteens, old people¹s homes and 
				refugee centers, and dental health programme for students. </p>
				<center>
				<p align="left">³Preserve Planet Earth², which has become Rotary 
				International¹s motto since 1990, has been implemented in Macau, 
				with our club closely cooperating with local environmental 
				activists, by supporting their purchase of equipment to measure 
				pollution, developing a civic education campaign for keeping the 
				city clean and beautiful and also by organizing tree planting 
				activities. Other community service included a van donated to 
				Caritas for the distribution of meals to elderly people living 
				alone. Vegetarian meals were offered to the blind and elderly 
				people at Chinese New Year when ³Lai See² were also offered. 
				Special equipment was sent to the Concordia School for the 
				hearing impared. </p>
				<center>
				<p align="left">The Rotary Club of Macau does not only confine 
				its activities to those in need in Macau, it also plays its part 
				in helping the world at large in the true spirit of Rotary 
				International. The Club has taken an active part in the campaign 
				against famine in Ethiopia, and in disaster relief in Columbia, 
				Bangladesh and China. In 1997, we donated funds through our 
				District to provide water storage facilities in outlying 
				provinces in China that suffer from a short rainy season and a 
				consequent water supply problem. </p>
				<center>
				<p align="left">In 1999-2000, the Rotary Club of Macau together 
				with the Rotary Club of Kowloon North, the Rotary Club of Taipei 
				North, the Ama Rotary Club in Nagoya, and the Macau Catholic 
				Social Services, built three primary schools in remote mountain 
				villages in Du¹An, Guangxi province. The 2001-2002 Rotary Year, 
				in a joint project with the Rotary Club of Kowloon North, two 
				more primary schools were built, the Yan Ma and the Jian Qiao 
				primary schools. In addition, the completion of the unfinished 
				building and the construction of new facilities and a dormitory 
				for the Experimental Middle School n Du¹An Town had its 
				ceremonial inauguration that August. We have also provided funds 
				for the disaster relief that have been administered through both 
				the Catholic Social Service and through Rotary District 3450. We 
				will continue to make funds available for such emergency relief.
				</p>
				<center>
				<p align="left">Our Club is honoured with 34 Paul Harris Fellow 
				and 4 Benefactors, who have made contributions to the Rotary 
				Foundation, and through which the Rotary Club of Macau has 
				sponsored promising young men and women to further their studies 
				abroad in order to better serve Macau on their return. In 1978, 
				Dr. Alfredo Ritchie was awarded a scholarship to study endoscopy 
				in the USA and on his return, he was pioneer of this technique 
				in Macau and later became the head of the Endoscopy Department 
				in the Macau Government Hospital. Dr. Ritchie became a Rotarian 
				in 1983 and was the President for the 1987-88 Rotary year and 
				2001-02 Rotary year. Another scholarship was awarded to Dr. Tito 
				Lopes who went to Australia to specialize in geriatrics, a 
				specialty much in demand in Macau. For the Rotary year 2001-02, 
				our Club sponsored Dr. Mok Toi Meng, who went to Melbourne as an 
				ambassadorial scholar and furthered her studies in the field of 
				cardiology. </p>
				<center>
				<p align="left">With the increase of females in the professional 
				world, our Club inducted its first female member in 1992 and by 
				this year our Club has 9 active female members. Out of the 9 
				female members, Stella Kan became the first female President for 
				the Rotary year 1996-97, followed by Synthia Chan as this year¹s 
				President and Fatima Ferreira as President Elect for the year 
				2004-05. </p>
				<center>
				<p align="left">To commemorate our 50th Anniversary, a special 
				post mark and specially designed envelope was introduced to the 
				public on our birthday, 16th June, 1997, in Macau. Another event 
				to mark the 50 years movement in Macau, the ³Blind-Aid Charity 
				Concert² was held on 13th December, 1997, at the Macau Stadium, 
				Taipa, to help blind persons in Macau and China. The concert was 
				co-organized by the Macau Catholic Social Services and the Orbis 
				Charity, with the support of Macau Government. The effort put 
				into this concert by our Club led to the award of ³The Best 
				Achievement in International Service² that year. </p>
				<center>
				<p align="left">For 3 consecutive years since the Rotary year 
				1999-2000, Rotary Club of Macau has organized Christmas Parties, 
				together with the 3 Centers of the Macau Association for the 
				Mentally Handicapped, where we share during this festive seasons 
				our love and care to these special children and their families. 
				In the Rotary year 2001-02, the 5 Rotary Clubs in Macau with the 
				cooperation of the Blood Transfusion Center, joined together to 
				formed the first Blood Donation Day on 13th January, 2002 where 
				88 persons donated blood on that single day. Last year, the 2nd 
				Blood Donation Day was held on 23rd March, 2003 where there was 
				an increase in the donors. Hence, this has become an annual 
				event for the 5 Rotary Clubs in Macau and shall continue to be 
				so. </p>
				<center>
				<p align="left">Now, Rotary Club of Macau has began its 57th 
				year where we are certainly looking forward to continuing 
				serving and ³Lend A Hand² to the local and international 
				communities in the best Rotary Spirit ­ ³Service is the 
				commitment we shall always be faithful to².</p>
