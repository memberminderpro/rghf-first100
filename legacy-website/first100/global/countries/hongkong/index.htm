									<td><font size="2">On 20th March 1930, 
									Honorary General Commissioner Rtn James W. 
									Davidson wrote to Rotary International 
									concerning the promotion of a Rotary Club in 
									Hong Kong. He was introduced to the 
									Governor, Sir William Peel, by Robert, later 
									Sir supporters of, the Rotary Movement. Sir 
									William was immediately sympathetic and 
									helpful. He was aware of the need for more 
									communication and understanding between the 
									various ethnic and social groupings in the 
									community. With this backing, and with the 
									help of such leading citizens as Robert 
									Kotewell, William Hornell, Vice Chancellor 
									of the University of Hong Kong, Dr. Aurther 
									Woo and W.E.L. Shanton, Senior Partner of 
									the Firm Deacons, Solicitors, Rtn Davidson 
									was able to send a cable to Rotary 
									International on 23rd November 1930, with 
									the news that the Rotary Club of Hong Kong 
									would be organized on 8th December 1930.<br>
									<br>
									Rtn Davidson had almost literally rounded up 
									a total of 79 of the leading citizens of 
									Hong Kong as Founder Members. There were 31 
									Chinese, one Indian, one Japanese and 46 
									Americans and Europeans.<br>
									<br>
									The new club met regularly from 8th December 
									1930 on Tuesdays at Lane Crawford's 
									Restaurant, such meetings were of course 
									provisional until Charter No. 3413 was 
									granted by Rotary International on 20th 
									February 1931.<br>
									<br>
									Meanwhile Rtn James W. Davidson and his 
									family had left Hong Kong to return to 
									Chicago. After revisiting Shanghai and Japan 
									he left Yokohama on 12th March to Vancouver. 
									Having filed his report in Chicago he 
									returned to his home in Canada. His health 
									had been declining for some time, partly at 
									least as a result of the hardship and 
									tropical sickness on his journey through 
									southern Asia, and he died shortly after 
									returning home.<br>
									<br>
									Rotary in Hong Kong owes it to Rtn Davidson 
									to record the following quotation from an 
									address by Rtn Julean Arnold of Shanghai 
									when he visited the Rotary Club of Hong Kong 
									on 17th November 1931:<br>
									<br>
									<i>&quot;Hong Kong was supposed to be the hardest 
									place in the world in which to start a 
									Rotary Club. Jim (Davidson) was a great 
									organizer, and I was not surprised at his 
									trying to crack this hard nut. His great joy 
									when he came back to Shanghai after a tour 
									devoted to starting Rotary clubs was his 
									accomplishment in organizing the Hong Kong 
									Rotary Club in which he took great pride.&quot;</i><br>
									<br>
									In 1935 Rotary International decided to form 
									a District No. 81 to unite member clubs in 
									Hong Kong, China and the Philippines. The 
									club celebrated its tenth anniversary in 
									February 1941 with a dinner in the Rooftop 
									Garden Restaurant at the Hong Kong Hotel.<br>
									<br>
									The gathering storm clouds of war over the 
									whole of Asia must have cast a somber shadow 
									on the mood of Rotary gatherings as the 
									thirties gave way to the forties.<br>
									Yet few members could have realized that the 
									meeting on 2nd December 1941, when they 
									heard Mr James Lee give a talk with slides 
									on &quot;The Splendor of Peking&quot;, would be their 
									last chance to meet in freedom and in 
									fellowship for four years.<br>
									<br>
									In July 1945 came the liberation of Hong 
									Kong and the city's long process of 
									rebuilding a normal pattern of life. In 
									November of that year, a Past President, Dr 
									Arthur W. Woo, called a party of friends 
									together for lunch at the Cafe de Chine. 
									Many happy atmosphere reminded him of Rotary 
									activities in the &quot;old days&quot;. This was 
									evidently the cue Dr Woo had been awaiting. 
									In reply he suggested that the work of 
									Rotary be revived.<br>
									<br>
									E.J.R. Mitchell undertook to plan a 
									programme of events, beginning with a 
									meeting which was, in effect, the 
									re-inauguration of the club. In January 1946 
									the first postwar Rotary lunch in Hong Kong 
									took place at the Gloucester Hotel's 
									restaurant. A motion passed noted that the 
									Club had &quot;been in abeyance&quot; since 1941 and 
									stated that it had now been restarted.</font><p>
									<font size="2">It was revealed the club 
									still had $7,000 in the bank, but this was 
									frozen under wartime rules and so funds were 
									urgently needed. Members were asked to pay 
									their half-yearly fee of $15 immediately, 
									which they did. The Club came back to life. 
									It was resolved that future meetings would 
									take place at the same venue.<br>
									<br>
									There were, of course, some other 
									formalities still to be undergone. Rotary 
									International's headquarters was contacted 
									with an application for readmission, a 
									request that was readily approved on the 
									basis that the Club had never really ceased 
									to exist. A duplicate copy of the Charter 
									was dispatched from the US. Many of the Club 
									records, previously assumed to have been 
									destroyed, were found in a metal box at the 
									former Sports Club in King's Building, 
									Connaught Road.<br>
									<br>
									The postwar years were a time of challenge 
									of Hong Kong. A massive increase in 
									population, caused in the main by an influx 
									of refugees from China, stretched community 
									and welfare services to breaking point. It 
									was a time of particular need fro the type 
									of help groups such as Rotary could provide. 
									The decision was made to have not just one 
									but many Rotary Clubs in the Territory.<br>
									<br>
									The result of this was that from 1947, when 
									the Rotary Club of Macau was formed, until 
									the present day, the spirit of Rotary is now 
									witnessed in no fewer than 48 clubs in what 
									has become District 3450.<br>
									<br>
									In the context of Hong Kong, Rotary can be 
									said to have created greater Cohesion within 
									the community. As the former Hong Kong 
									Governor, Sir Alexander Gratham commented 
									when he addressed the Club in 1956: &quot;If I 
									were asked what one thing more than any 
									other brought the Chinese and non-Chinese 
									together, as we now take it for granted, it 
									was the establishment of The Rotary Club of 
									Hong Kong&quot;.<br>
									<br>
									Today, The Rotary Club of Hong Kong is known 
									as the &quot;Mother Club&quot; of Rotary International 
									District 3450, and it is from our Club that 
									the Rotary movement branched out in this 
									District.<br>
									Thus, the Mother and Premier Club continues 
									to play an important role in community, 
									vocational and international services; 
									always bearing in mind the Rotary motto of 
									Service Above Self. members of the Club are 
									called upon to expound &quot;The Four Way Test&quot;: 
									Is it TRUTH? Is it FAIR to all concerned? 
									Will it build GOODWILL and BETTER 
									FRIENDSHIP&quot; Will it be BENEFICIAL to all 
									concerned?<br>
									<br>
									Membership of the Club comprises many of 
									Hong Kong's most distinguished citizens who 
									came together in a desire to serve. 
									Rotarians are expected to perform diligently 
									their share of service to the Club, to their 
									vocations, to the community, and towards 
									better international understanding. They are 
									bound by the Club's Constitution and By-Laws 
									under Rotary International.<br>
									<br>
									The Club has celebrated its Golden Jubilee, 
									and subsequently its Diamond Jubilee. The 
									services it accomplished are numerous and 
									vast, and extended to all sectors of our 
									society. In recent years, we have worked on 
									programmes that benefited the people of the 
									People's Republic of China. The Club's 
									projects are too varied to recount, and they 
									include, scholarships, student exchange 
									programmes, orphanages, polioplus campaign 
									(to eradicate polio by the year 2000), 3-H 
									programme (that of hunger, health and 
									humanity), elderly homes, hospice care, and 
									so on.<br>
									<br>
									Since Tuesday, 18th June 1996, a group of 
									Rtns from the Club together with Rotarians 
									from Rotary Clubs from around the world, 
									have been holding informal meetings in 
									Beijing on a weekly basis. In May 1996, Rtns 
									hosted a splendid 100 year's birthday party 
									for PP of the former Rotary Club of Shanghai 
									(1934-35), Rtn Percy Chu.<br>
									<br>
									Thus bound by our ideal of service and 
									fellowship, the Club has surged forth to the 
									New Millennium to serve the Community.</font></td>
