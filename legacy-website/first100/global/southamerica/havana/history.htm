			The Spanish American War</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19"  width: 50%>The revolution started 
		by Jose Martin in 1895 led in 1898 to the Spanish American War of 100 
		days &quot; and Cuban independence in 1902. This war, in spite of its 
		tremendous implications for the United States, Spain, Cuba, and other 
		places, never received much attention. After the American Civil War 
		(1861-1865), a conflict of truly epic proportions, with a loss of 
		approximately three-quarters of a million men, in the war of 1898 &quot;only&quot; 
		three thousand men were lost. Some may have heard the statement 
		&quot;Remember the MAINE&quot;. In response to a small protest by Spanish 
		officers, not affecting the United States, Washington sent the USS MAINE 
		to Cuba on a &quot;friendly&quot; visit. In the evening of February 15, the MAINE 
		was shattered by two explosions and rapidly sank. Two hundred and 
		fifty-two men were killed. After the disaster, U.S. newspapers were 
		quick to place responsibility for the loss on Spain, while later studies 
		have indicated that the ship probably sunk as a result of a coal bunker 
		fire adjacent to its ammunition magazines. Despite of his efforts to 
		avoid war, President McKinley finally decided to military intervene in 
		Cuba to end the ongoing unrest and liberate Cuba from Spanish rule. In 
		American history, the Spanish American War is mostly considered as a 
		silly lark taken by a group of over-eager men with no real gain, though 
		this goes against historical fact in many respects.<br><br>Rotary ante 
		portas<br><br>In the same year, 1898, 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1910harris/paulharris/gateway/index.htm">Paul Harris</a> entered into a 
		partnership as the senior to form the law firm of 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1910harris/paulharris/law/index.htm">Harris and Dodds</a>.While 
		we can only speculate if the idea of a Rotary club was already on his 
		mind, two later prominent Rotarians fought in the Spanish American War. 
		<br><br><a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/schiele/">Silvester Schiele</a> had volunteered to serve with the United States armed 
		forces, and also fought in the Santiago de Cuba campaign. More details 
		are known about 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/secretariat/perry/index1.htm">Chesley Perry</a> from the rolls of the Illinois volunteers, 
		who also went to Cuba in 1898 as a soldier and as a correspondent for 
		the Chicago Times Herald. He enrolled as a 2nd Lieutenant in April 1898, 
		was promoted to 1st Lieutenant, and was on special duty as officer in 
		charge of regimental exchange until March 1899. In Cuba Perry met 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/cities/clubs/24-pagetwo.htm">Wesley 
		King</a>, who in 1911 founded the Rotary club of Salt Lake City.<br><br>

		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/southamerica/havana/index.htm">Havana - Club City of the World</a><br>
		<br>In 1918, more than one-third of the total population of Habana of 
		approximately 350,000 were members of various clubs. So it was quite 
		natural that Habana was the first city in a non&#8209;English speaking country 
		to have a Rotary club.Also the Rotary club idea was essentially 
		different from all of the many club ideas which had found root in 
		Habana, the city was so accustomed to clubs of all kinds that Rotary was 
		readily accepted. The leading clubs of the city, considered from the 
		standpoint of number of members and wealth of their treasuries, were the 
		various organizations known as Centros. These were originally organized 
		by Spanish residents of the city whose purpose was to unite in a social 
		organization those of their compatriots who came from the same section 
		of Spain. In addition to its social and recreative functions, the 
		Centros soon developed certain mutual aid and benefit features, which 
		became a real necessity in the lives of the people of Habana. Some of 
		the Centros, such as the Balear and Castellano, admitted women as well 
		as men to membership. Most Centros were chiefly composed of Spanish born 
		or the immediate descendants of such. The exception to this rule was the 
		Centro de Dependientes, founded in 1881, one of the three largest and 
		wealthiest of these organizations, to which most of the Cubans and 
		residents of foreign birth belonged.<br><br>Club Rotario de la Habana &quot; 
		the Foundation.<br><br>In the April issue of The Rotarian, a short note 
		&quot;Rotary and Latin-America&quot; is followed by the names of the members of 
		the General Committee on Extension of Rotary in Latin-America. The 
		organization of the Rotary Club of Havana, the first non-English 
		speaking Rotary Club, was sponsored by the Rotary Club of Tampa, 
		Florida, and the committee was composed of A. L. Cuesta, Sr., John A. 
		Turner and Ernest Berger.<br><br>

		on April 29th, 1916. Among its charter members were Angel Gonzales del 
		Valle, in 1922 president and sketched in &quot;La Rueda&quot;, the magazine of the 
		Rotary Club of Havana, by the famous Cuban cartoonist Massaguer, and 
		Ramon Arguelles, owner of the famous &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; cigar factory.<br>

		100 members. The club had obtained the establishment of traffic laws for 
		its city. It developed a comprehensive city plan and had a remarkable 
		program of civic enterprise. The civic program of the club included for 
		instance:<br><br>- The acquisition for the city of the surrounding 
		heights&nbsp;&nbsp; which on account of their location may be suitable 
		for parks and other public uses.<br>- To acquire also suitable grounds 
		in the most populated districts with the object of dedicating them to 
		the public as playgrounds, gymnasia and bathing places&nbsp; &quot;.<br>

		eight years of the founding of the Havana club, other clubs were added 
		at Matanzas, Sagua la Grande, Cienfuegos, Guantanamo, Trinidad, 
		Camagüey, Santiago, Caibarien, Santa Clara, and Sancti Spritus. All of 
		them flourished, and found many opportunities to serve their respective 
		communities. The objectives concentrated mainly on sanitation, with 
		special emphasis on the extermination of the mosquito.<br><br>The Ladder 
		That Came in Handy<br><br>Havana, Cuba. &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Rotarians had 
		an interesting and rather exciting &quot; experience at a meeting of the
		Havana Rotary. The meeting was held in the roof garden of the Paza 
		Hotel. And while a flashlight picture was being taken some of the 
		decorations were ignited by the exploding magnesium powder. A panic 
		was averted by the prompt arrival of the fire department and a new
		extension ladder recently presented to the department by the Havana 
		Rotarians came in handy.<br><br>[The Rotarian, August 1925]<br><br>

		whose honor the meeting was arranged [The Rotarian, May 1927].<br><br>In 
		1928, the Rotary Club of Havana was responsible for the initiation and 
		successful conducting of the first National Congress of the welfare of 
		the child. The statements in the resolution adopted sound rather modern, 
		for instance:<br><br>- The child has the right to be born under social 
		and physical conditions which will lead to a normal life.<br>- The 
		child has the right to receive from society all the means for a free 
		development, mentally, morally and spiritually.<br><br>In a 
		letter to the secretariat of Rotary International, past Director Luis 
		Machado (no relation to Cuba's former president) wrote:<br><br>&quot;In order 
		to prevent civil war, which was imminent between the various political 
		divisions, the Rotary Club of Havana appointed a committee of five, of 
		which I am the chairman, to act as mediator between the government on 
		one side and the opposition on the other, in an effort to find a 
		friendly solution to all the political problems&nbsp; &quot;. [The Rotarian, 
		November, 1933].<br><br>However, in September, 1933, in an uprising

		1937, during the opening session of the First Rotary Regional Conference 
		of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, held in Havana, Cuba's 
		President, Senor Laredo Bru, offered R.I. President Will R. Manier, Jr., 
		the Cross of the Order of Carlos Manuel de Cespedes &quot; the highest Cuban 
		decoration &quot; as a recognition of the valuable service Rotary is 
		rendering to humanity.<br><br>

		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/conventions/1940/index.htm">The 1940 
		Convention</a><br><br>Originally, the 1940 World Convention was to take 
		place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, but was held in Havana probably because 
		of WWII. R.I. President Walter D. Head wrote in The Rotarian in March 
		1940:<br><br>&quot;It is my thought that the keynote of the Havana Convention 
		might be the renewal of Rotary fellowship amid Old World surroundings. 
		This is not a year for elaborate festivity. We are too keenly conscious 
		of the fact that many of our fellow Rotarians are citizens of countries 
		which are, to a greater or lesser extent, involved in the numerous 
		conflicts now taking place&nbsp; &quot;.<br><br>Paul Harris could not attend 
		the because of sickness, but he was able to return from the hospital to 
		his home during the Convention. His message was read to the Convention. 
		He wrote about Rotary's efforts to promote the brotherhood of men, which 
		&quot;in the light of current events and in the light of history, seem to 
		many nothing more than an empty dream&nbsp; &quot; and continued:<br><br>The 
		best way to proof that a miracle can be performed is to perform the 
		miracle. Rotary has performed its miracle. Rotary has actually become 
		part of the civic life of sixty nations. Rotary stands; though the 
		tempest rage about &quot; Rotary still stands. Why and how? Because it is 
		grounded not on fear, rivalry and suspicion, but on the eternal and 
		indestructible rocks of friendliness, tolerance, and usefulness&quot;.<br><br>

		splendid success. The Convention Proceeding comment on the event:<br>
		<br>&quot;Looking back on convention week, it seems that each night brought 
		with it a new high in entertainment. Perhaps it was the spell wielded by 
		the tropic nights, a magic of deep, ebon-black skies and bright stars, 
		gently waving palms, and a soft caressing breeze bespeaking mystery and 
		romance, that made each event a never-to-be-forgotten experience&quot;.<br>
		<br>But credit the success also to the ingenuity of the host club.<br>
		<br>A special stamp with the Rotary wheel and a number of beautiful 
		first day issues were printed on this occasion.<br><br>

		1940, a Constitution was established by the national assembly of Cuba. 
		The document struck a balance between the rich and the working class, it 
		protected individual and social rights, supported full employment and a 
		minimum wage, extended social security, called for equal pay for equal 
		work and outlawed the huge plantations known as latifundias. General 
		Fulcenio Batista was elected Cuba's 14th president.<br><br>In January 
		1946, Cuba had 44 Clubs with approximately 1,400 Rotarians. It had by 
		then furnished four Directors of Rotary International &quot; Mario Nunez Meza 
		(1922-23), Luis Machado (1931-32), and Dr. Manuel Galigarcia (1942-43), 
		all of the Rotary Club of Havana, and Felipe Silva (1936-37) of the 
		Rotary Club of Cienfuegos.<br><br>The Revolution<br><br>The 
		fifties were a decisive decade in Cuba's turbulent history. In March 
		1952, Batista took over again in a bloodless coup d' etat. The 
		elections, three month away, were cancelled. The United States 
		recognized Batista's government. <br><br>In July, 1953, Fidel Castro 
		lead a revolt in which 100 men and women attacked army barracks near 
		Santiago de Cuba. The attack failed, Castro was arrested and sentenced 
		to 15 years in prison. In 1955, he and his revolutionaries were released 
		from prison in a general amnesty.<br><br>In November 1957, Cuba was the 
		second time host to the Caribbean-Gulf of Mexico Regional Conference of 
		Rotary International. Cuba had 58 Rotary Clubs with 1,800 members.<br>
		<br>The battle of Jigüe in July 1958 marked the turning point in the 
		war between the government and the revolutionary forces. The government 
		troops were surrounded by the Rebel units. Unable to break out, the 
		battalion ran out of food and surrendered. In January 1959, the 
		revolutionary forces took control of Havana. The U.S. government 
		officially recognized the new Cuban government. Cuba's constitution of 
		1940, suspended in 1952 by General Batista, was reinstated.<br><br>

		International of November 14th, 1978, reads:<br><br>&quot;After due 
		consideration of the guidelines established by the board at its 
		October-November, 1978, meeting for the termination of membership in 
		Rotary International of Rotary clubs located in countries in which 
		Rotary clubs may not be able to function, the board, effective 31 
		January, 1979, terminates the membership in Rotary International of the 
		clubs in Afghanistan, Burma, Cuba, Laos, and Vietnam and declares the 
		charters issued to the clubs to be null and void&quot;.<br><br>The American 
		journalist Walter Lippmann wrote in 1959:<br><br>&quot;For the thing we 
		should never do in dealing with revolutionary countries, in which the 
		world abounds, is to push them behind an iron curtain raised by 
		ourselves. On the contrary,[ ) the right thing to do is to keep the way 
		open for their return&quot;.<br><br>The contents of this article are mainly 
		based on information from The Rotarian. Between 1916 and 1980 Rotary in 
		Cuba is mentioned in over a hundred short notes and in a few articles, 
		some in Spanish. The information about Cuba's history are taken from the 
		internet site <a href="http://www.historyofcuba.com/">www.historyofcuba.com</a>, written and compiled by J. A.
