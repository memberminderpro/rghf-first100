		As with the growth of Rotary in Australia, the main catalysts for 
		Rotary’s beginnings in New Zealand lie with the two Canadian 
		commissioners Jim Davidson and Layton Ralston.<br>
		<br>
		<img class="auto-style25" src="/first100/global/australia/newzealand/history/index_files/image001.jpg" style="float: left">Yet, the first seeds of growth were sown by the Hon. (later, Sir) 
		George Fowlds. George, a Scot by birth, was a prosperous draper and 
		visited both Canada and the USA between August and November 1920. Fowlds 
		often appeared at Rotary and Kiwanis meetings as guest speaker but did 
		not actively consider Rotary for himself until he appeared at the Rotary 
		Club of Victoria, BC, Canada. Fowlds was a former Minister of Education 
		for New Zealand which would have made him an obvious choice for Rotary 
		club speaker. Among Fowlds other achievements; he was President of the 
		University of Auckland and President of the Board of Trustees of the 
		University of New Zealand. From the Victoria club, Fowlds received 
		information from the club secretary and this inspired him to call in at 
		Rotary headquarters in Chicago.<br><br>(Forward by New Zealand Prime 
		Minister, S. G. Holland, 14 January 1955)<br><br><br><br>
		<a href="/first100/global/australia/newzealand/images/pmnz1955.JPG" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style26" src="/first100/global/australia/newzealand/history/pmnz1955_small.JPG" style="float: left"></a>In March 1921, a gentleman from Victoria (named 
		Jones) arrived in Auckland with a letter of introduction from the 
		secretary of the Victoria club. As Fowlds himself remembered: “I 
		utilised his presence in Auckland to issue invitations to about fifty of 
		our citizens to a luncheon in the Pacific Club, to meet Mr Jones and 
		listen to a talk about Rotary. I got a splendid response, and at the 
		close of the luncheon a small committee was appointed to consider the 
		question of forming a Rotary Club in Auckland.”<br><br>This meeting took 
		place on April 4th 1921 and was the first step taken to establish Rotary 
		in New Zealand.<br><br>The Wellington Club was the first club 
		established in New Zealand in June 7th 1921 with the Auckland Club 
		formed a week later with Fowlds the first club President. Davidson 
		recalled the day he reached Auckland on May 30th. He had already been 
		cabled by Ches Perry with Fowlds name. Davidson found Fowlds “very 
		public spirited and highly respected”.<br><br>Davidson had also been 
		informed that the two club Charters had already been signed in Chicago 
		and he was ‘instructed’ to make sure the capital city was club number 
		one. Therefore, Ralston was given a weeks start to charter the 
		Wellington club. Davidson’s main problem at this time was the fact that 
		the eager Aucklanders were determined to charter their club in three 
		days –35 charter members were needed but Auckland already had forty!<br><br>
		&quot;The root idea of the clubs is human service...The aim of Rotarians is 
		to do things, to do them willingly and unselfishly and to fit themselves 
		to render better service to their town, their province and their nation&quot;<br>
		<br>Jim Davidson addressing the inaugural meeting of the Auckland club 
		on June 13th 1921.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style25" src="/first100/global/australia/newzealand/history/index_files/image002.jpg" style="float: left">It was Fowlds and Charles Rhodes (future RI 
		Director 1923-24) who would continue expanding Rotary throughout New 
		Zealand as special commissioners. Rhodes, managing director of the Waihi 
		Gold Mining Company, would travel to the St. Louis Convention in 1923 
		where he was introduced by Past President Arch Klumph. He addressed 
		delegates with a noted speech in which he praised the work of Davidson 
		and Ralston. At the end of the Convention Rhodes was the ninth RI 
		Director.<br><br>Fowlds would follow Rhodes the coming year as he 
		travelled back to Canada -to the Toronto Convention-and greeted 
		delegates with a speech entitled “We are happy to be in Toronto.” Both 
		men were absolutely convinced that Rotarians did not know anything about 
		New Zealand!<br><br>One of Fowlds ambitions was to capture the 1928 
		Convention for Auckland which did not succeed.<br><br>Fowlds and Rhodes 
		rapidly expanded Rotary in New Zealand. The first success was the 
		Christchurch club established in April 1922 after an initial meeting on 
		November 17th 1921. The Dunedin, Hamilton, Invercargill, Wanganui, 
		Napier, Hastings, Palmerston North, Hawera, New Plymouth, Oamaru and 
		Whangarei clubs followed soon after. At the end of Fowlds’ three year 
		term, the Emeritus President of Rotary International wrote to Fowlds “I 
		am sure I do not know how it would be possible for any country to 
		accomplish more than new Zealand has accomplished during the few years 
		of Rotary existence there.”<br><br>The first Australasian Conference 
		took place in September 1924 in Sydney with many New Zealanders present. 
		At the time, New Zealand had TWICE as many clubs as Australia.<br><br>It 
		was now time for a Rotary District in New Zealand with its own Governor.<br>
