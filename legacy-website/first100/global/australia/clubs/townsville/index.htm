		Townsville was a port city of 25,000 people when the Rotary Club of 
		Townsville was chartered in 1926. It served the needs of the pastoral, 
		agricultural and mining industries in the north and north-west of 
		Queensland.<br><br>The idea of a community service club as an 
		organization for the carrying out of specific jobs of some public 
		benefit developed fairly slowly. Fellowship and the social side seemed 
		to predominate in the early years.<br><br>However, when the depression 
		of the 1930's hit Australia, the club was quick to respond to the needs 
		of the community. It raised funds for the social services, (social 
		security as we know it today was non-existent then), for Christmas gifts 
		for distressed people and for meals for the unemployed and their 
		families.<br><br>In the early World War II years, (1939-1941) the club 
		concentrated it's efforts on fund-raising for the Red Cross Society and 
		in supporting the purchase of war bonds.<br><br>Townsville was one of 
		the largest military bases in the South-West Pacific region during the 
		war with Japan. The civilian population of 30,000 was increased by up to 
		100,000 Australian and United States troops in the years 1942 and 1943. 
		The U.S. Army 5th Air Firce was formed in Townsville and from it's 
		current base in Japan has responsibility for the Pacific and South-East 
		Asia zone.<br><br>Many of the club's members enlisted with the armed 
		forces or were assigned by the Government to essential war-based 
		activities. Nevertheless, the club still remained active in raising 
		funds fo rthe Red Cross, Comforts Fund and the Armed Services Clubs, 
		obtaining blankets for war victims and in entertaining the troops.<br>
		<br>Upon cessation of hostilities the club thrrew it's support behind 
		the 'Food for Britian' appeal, sending thousands of food parcels to 
		designated depots in Britian. The club also backed the Government's 
		&quot;Bring out a Briton' scheme.<br><br>The club purchased, renovated and 
		equipped ex-Army buildings at Rowes bay for the establishment of a Bush 
		Children's Home on Crown land. The health of children from the outback 
		had always been a club favourite and now a newly-formed Bush Children's 
		Home Committee could organize annual holidays with medical care.<br><br>
		It also purchased a war surplus building for use by the 
		newly-established branch of the YMCA in Townsville.<br><br>In 1962, the club formed the 
		&quot;Townsville Senior Citizens Welfare Association&quot; and raised funds for 
		the erection of suitable buildings on a seaside location, leased from 
		the Harbour Board. The Association was so successful that more buildings 
		had to be erected by the club to meet the needs of our seniors. The 
		Association is now self-supporting.<br><br>A major project for the youth 
		of the City was the building of a Traffic Training Centre and playground 
		on land donated by the City Council. The project was completed in 1975 
		and extended in 1981. It is highly valued by educational authorities for 
		the training it provides to schoolchildren.<br><br>In 1978, the club was 
		invited to join the Red Cross Society and the Townsville and District 
		Rugby Union in poineering &quot;Bingo City&quot; as a major fund-raising venture, 
		proceeds and costs to be shared equally among the three bodies. During 
		the 22 years that &quot;Bingo City&quot; has been in operation, the Rotary Club 
		has distributed $1.7M to charity and community groups as it's share of 
		the net proceeds from Bingo.<br><br>The club introduced a Community 
		Chest Motor Car Art Union in 1985. The club provides all prizes and all 
		expenses (tickets, permits etc), conducts and accounts for the Art Union 
		with all participating groups retaining the full proceeds of their 
		ticket sales. Distribution from the 16 Annual Car Art Unions total 
		$1.15M for a total cost to the club of $397,762 (from it's bingo 
		fund-raising).<br><br>One of the main beneficiaries from the Bingo 
		fund-raising was the Good Shephard Nursing Home which received $350,000 
		over a period of years.<br><br>Although Bingo fund-raising and the Car 
		Art Union take a lot of the members time, other projects are not 
		neglected. The Townsville club was one of the first in Australia to 
		conduct Bowelscan (in 1993) and has done so annually since. Polio Plus 
		was a special project, with it's own fund-raising – our four-year target 
		was reached in the first year.<br><br>The twin cities of Townsville and 
		Thuringowa now have a population of 150,000, with 10 Rotary clubs. They 
		are thriving communities with many industries, including the largest 
		zinc refinery (Sun Metals) in the world and with major defense 
		installation of the Army and Air Force.<br><br>Rotary continues to serve 
		Townsville well!&nbsp;</td>
