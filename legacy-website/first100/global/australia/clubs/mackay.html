		<img class="auto-style26" src="mackay/mackay-banner.jpg" style="float: left">In 
		July 1926 Rotarian Tom McWilliam of Brisbane Rotary Club arrived in 
		Mackay with a commission from Ches. Perry of Rotary International to 
		investigate the possibility of a Rotary Club being formed in Mackay and 
		to submit a report. He called on a number of citizens and explained the 
		purpose of his visit. He subsequently invited these gentlemen to have 
		lunch with him at the Grand Hotel Cnr. Victoria, Brisbane St. (where AAA 
		Stationery now stands.) After telling his guests what Rotary was about, 
		there followed a frank discussion.<br><br>A preliminary meeting was held 
		at the Imperial Hotel, Victoria St. Tuesday 27th July 1926. Mr W. A. 
		Amiet occupied the chair. A committee of seven was elected and thus the 
		Rotary Club of Mackay was formed, pending the granting of a Charter. The 
		Charter dated 16th October 1926 No.2418 was received in December 1926.<br>
		<br>1920-30s<br><br>Boy Scout Movement.<br><br>In the 1926-29 period, 
		considerable assistance was given to the Boy Scout movement in Mackay. 
		Rotarian John Michelmore Snr. made an acre of ground available to grow 
		vegetables under the supervision of himself and other Rotarians, who 
		also supervised the marketing of the produce. The proceeds of this went 
		towards the building of a Scout Den in Victoria Park. In later years, 
		Glendarragh Campsite, later named at the opening of Rowallan Park, 
		became a Club project and many working bees have taken place there. The 
		late Rotarian Dave Pratt made this his special project. Mayor Ian Wood 
		officially opened Rowallan Park 12th September 1953.<br><br>1940s<br>
		<br>Clothes for Britain.<br><br>The Red Cross called on Rotary to 
		conduct an appeal for “Clothes for Britain” lasting over a period of two 
		weeks. Clothes were collected by Boy Scouts, cleaned free of charge by 
		Rotarian Walter Beatty's steam laundry, sorted by the CWA, and packed 
		and cased by Rotarians - 160 cases of clothing covering boys, girls, men 
		and women were assembled and dispatched.<br><br>Troops in Transit.<br>
		<br>During the war years special trains were running daily, closely 
		following on each other conveying many thousands of tons of war material 
		and equipment to northern areas. A 24-hour service, seven days a week 
		was instituted so that men and women in uniform were provided with hot 
		meals and refreshments at a nominal cost. Rotarians were prominent in 
		organising this continuous service. Owing to excessive wet weather 
		causing floods and hold-ups the troops were frequently stranded at 
		Mackay in increasing numbers. The Rotary Club of Mackay was instrumental 
		in establishing and conducting a Billeting Committee who arranged for 
		thousands of those in the services to be billeted in private homes. In 
		one instance 1000 American troops were billeted for the three days they 
		were delayed. During this period, The Rotary Club of Mackay: Organised 
		the local effort in the first Victory War Loan Pledge scheme. Promoted a 
		scheme whereby parcels were sent to relatives of members or to Rotarians 
		on Active Service. Maintained an open welcome to all on War Service as 
		guests of Rotarians. Made Food for Britain contributions of £106. Was 
		responsible for launching the War Savings Campaign. Posted notices in 
		H.O. American Air Force and American Red Cross in Mackay extending 
		hospitality at Club meetings. Were instrumental in establishing Air Raid 
		Wardens in Mackay - the principal officers being Rotarians<br><br>

		56th District Assembly at Mackay on 6 &amp; 7 September, 1946 was only the 
		second district assembly to be held in Queensland. Delegates pictured

		<br>1960s<br><br>Queensland's Last Steam Train.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="130" src="mackay/mackay-last-steam-train.gif" style="float: left" width="190">History 
		was made in Mackay on Sunday 21st December 1969 when the last official 
		journey by a steam train in Queensland was made. Thanks to the 
		cooperation of the Railway Department, the Rotary Club of Mackay 
		sponsored the project, all proceeds from which will benefit the Mackay 
		Ambulance Brigade.<br><br>University Centre.<br><br>The club and 
		individual members gave financial and general help to the Mackay 
		University Centre and were largely responsible for the raising of 
		$18,000 for North Queensland University Residential Colleges located in 
		Townsville.<br><br>1970s<br><br>RYLA.<br><br>The club participated in 
		the first Rotary Youth Leadership Award (RYLA) project held by Rotary 
		District 255. The Club's awardees were Mr G Stockie for his work in the 
		Boy Scouts movement and Mr E Bryant for his work with the Junior Rugby 
		League. They reported that the week's seminar was very informative and 
		rewarding.<br><br>1980s<br><br>Sale of Paintings by Australian Outback 
		Artists.<br><br>This was a joint venture project in conjunction with 
		Mackay West Rotary Club. A joint planning committee of the two clubs was 
		formed and commenced meeting in early October 1987. A very satisfactory 
		result was achieved from the exhibition, which took place in April at 
		the Mackay Entertainment Centre. From a total of 75 paintings received 
		for the exhibition, 50 were sold as well as 14 prints, and in addition 
		an Art Union was arranged in which all 2000 tickets were sold. The 
		overall result was that $18,000.00 was raised for distribution between 
		the two clubs, and has allowed our Club to make some generous donations 
		to charitable and like bodies.<br><br>&quot;The Best of the Australian 
		Outback Artists&quot; Exhibition.<br><br>The exhibition was conducted for a 
		second time from 17th-21st May at the Mackay Entertainment Centre. It 
		was a joint project by the Mackay and Mackay West Rotary Clubs and 
		supervised by the following committee members: - Frank Hurley, Mike 
		Loveday, Ian Angus (Mackay West) Stewart Boyd, Rick Beasley, Stan 
		Fursman (Mackay). The sources of funds for the project were 
		sponsorships, sale of paintings and prints, an art union and sale of 
		catalogues. 113 Paintings were received together with a number of framed 
		and unframed prints and books on the artists. Sales totalled $74,320.<br>
		<br>1990s<br><br>Environmental Projects.<br><br>In March the Club 
		participated in the National Campaign to Cleanup Australia as the major 
		project for the year. The Club was a control point co-ordinator through 
		the Mackay City Council's area. Responsibilities included registration 
		of participants, provision of refreshments, distribution of collection 
		bags, provision of safety advice and sharps containers and arrangements 
		for the disposal of the collected rubbish. The project was very 
		successful with 60 children and 30 adults formally registering as 
		participants. In all, over 100 bags of rubbish were collected.<br><br>
		2000s<br><br>Snow's Place - Nebo.<br><br>Conceived and led throughout by 
		Wyn Cook, ably assisted by Warren Bridson and Marcella Massie, our club 
		signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Nebo Shire Council to provide 
		on-going support with the development of Snow's Place - a tourist and 
		cultural centre project. Nebo is a small country town 90 km from Mackay, 
		too small to sustain a Rotary Club, but in need of the support Rotary 
		can offer as it builds economic sustainability for its community.<br>
		<br>We have been involved in a number of meetings with Council and 
		others. The first round of community consultation has been completed, 
		and we are now involved in a series of meetings from which a concept 
		plan will be developed. At this stage, it is envisaged that the 
		centrepiece of Snow's Place will be Snow's cottage, supported by a range 
		of activities, including food concessions and amenities, probably the 
		Nebo Shire museum and may also include the Shire library. A very 
		significant long-term project for Nebo Shire, and for our club. To 
		demonstrate our commitment our club this year has committed $5,000 to 
		Snow's Place, to be held in trust until such time as we are called upon 
		to make our first financial contribution.<br><br>It is anticipated that 
		this project may well take three (or more) years to reach fruition. Our 
		congratulations to Wyn Cook for identifying and following through this 
		very significant and long-term community service project, a project 
		where our club, in partnership with the Nebo Shire Council, can make a 
		real long-term difference to a rural community. The overall project is 
		valued at more than $2.5 million dollars.<br><br>Rotary Club of Mackay<br>
