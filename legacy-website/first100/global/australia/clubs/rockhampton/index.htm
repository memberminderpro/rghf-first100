		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/australia/clubs/rockhampton/rockhampton12jan1926.jpg" style="float: left">The 
		Rotary Club of Rockhampton was chartered on 12 January 1926, being the 
		11th club established in Australia and the first in Queensland after 
		Brisbane.<br><br>The accompanying Family Tree (PDF file) of the Rotary 
		clubs of Central Queensland shows that Rockhampton was the progenitor of 
		37 clubs of which eight were directly sponsored by this Club with the 
		rest as ‘grandchildren’.<br><br>Historical records of the club are deposited 
		in the Capricornia Collection of the Library of Central Queensland 
		University. It is there noted that the early professional and business 
		community, as a group of rugged individualists, was not perhaps 
		initially ideal ground for planting the Four Way Test. It was only after 
		some years that members gradually responded to a recommendation to 
		address each other by first names.<br><br>Among the Foundation Members, 
		the first President, JJ Kenna established the accountancy firm that 
		bears his name, the recent Principal of which, Past President Ray 
		Tidbury, was a leading light in organizing celebrations of the 75th 
		anniversary of the Club. The founding Secretary, JJ Macaulay later 
		became President, as did his son Tom in 1969 and his grandson John in 
		1993. The third President ultimately became Lt-Col A Raff Woolcock DSO, 
		C de G, Commanding Officer of the 42nd Battalion, The Royal Queensland 
		Regiment. In 1998 the club established with the Officers Mess, The 
		Woolcock Dinner, a formal joint event recognizing annually the long and 
		continuing service of the Battalion to the community.<br><br>In the 
		1930s the club proposed development of a scenic drive along the 
		Athelstane Range and in 1946 moved to have an area of land on the Range 
		set out as a multi-purpose Park. In 1962 the club built a lookout on the 
		prime site. The club has since developed and beautified the area with 
		landscaping and a mural transforming an unsightly reservoir. In the 
		early 1990s the government agreed to transfer the surrounding site to 
		the City.<br><br>The club established the Crippled Children’s Society in 
		the 1930s, launched with support that made it independent of further 
		fund-raising for some time. The Bush Children’s Health Scheme was also 
		helped.<br><br>During the War and post-War the club ran big events to 
		raise funds for the Red Cross, Food for Britain etc. In an appeal for 
		Clothes for Britain a couple of hundred neck-ties were included. There 
		was a prompt message of thanks, with a hint that no more ties be sent on 
		account of an incident alleged to have occurred outside the Bank of 
		England where a respected burgher was held up at the point of an 
		umbrella by an irate lady who demanded: “By what right, Sir, do you wear 
		the tie of the Rockhampton Girls’ Grammar School Old Girl’s Association, 
		of which I am a Past President?”<br><br>In 1965 the club offered major 
		support to an appeal for funds for a Residential College which led by 
		progressive phases to today’s Central Queensland University.<br><br>In 
		1971 the club launched the Rockhampton Art Competition which ran 
		successfully for a number of years before it was adopted by Art 
		Societies and the City. The Mayor’s drive for a new gallery and funding 
		for major art acquisitions was supported by the club.<br><br>The club’s 
		organization of an annual concert for Senior Citizens, launched in 1970, 
		with personal transport and supper provided, remains a highlight of 
		every year. The former radio personality of Rockhampton, Charles 
		Patterson, has compared every year and has been made a Paul Harris 
		Fellow.<br><br>The club’s 75th Anniversary was celebrated with a major 
		gathering from near and far on 24 February 2001. Historical segments 
		were displayed and re-enacted. A Time Capsule to be opened on 12 January 
		2026 was set up adjacent to the Rotary Lookout.<br><br>The club is proud 
		of its relatively early action in admitting female members and pays 
		tribute to the strength and quality they have injected.&nbsp;</td>
