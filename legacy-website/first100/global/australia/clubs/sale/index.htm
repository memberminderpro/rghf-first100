		<img class="auto-style26" src="rotbann.gif" style="float: left">The Rotary Club of Sale 
		formed in 1928, its sponsor being the Rotary Club of Melbourne. At that 
		time Sale, with an urban population of around 4000, was the largest town 
		in the far-flung province of Gippsland, South East Victoria. The 
		importance of Sale at the time of the formation of the Sale Rotary Club 
		related directly to:<br><br>· Its status as a See town both for the 
		Anglican and Catholic churches.<br><br>· Its schools, particularly its 
		large boarding schools.<br><br>· Its hub position for transport systems 
		including water carriage through the famous Gippsland Lakes.<br><br>· 
		Its Gippsland Base Hospital.<br><br>· Its location adjacent to a rich 
		dairying, grazing and crop growing district.<br><br>· Its manufacturing 
		industries including foundry, flour mill, woollen mill and butter 
		factory.<br><br>Sale's town population has now grown to around 14,000. 
		Its agriculture has been strengthened by irrigation, its manufacture 
		enhanced by the offshore discovery of oil and natural gas in the nearby 
		Gippsland Basin, its service sector expanded by a large Royal Australian 
		Air Force training base at East Sale.<br><br>Membership of Rotary in 
		Sale has reflected the population changes of the town. In turn, Rotary 
		has contributed in a significant way to the shaping of the town's 
		amenities and to promoting its residents’ wellbeing.<br><br>From a 
		charter group of sixteen, the club had grown to over 70 members by the 
		early 1970s. A second club, the Rotary Club of Sale Central, was formed 
		in 1977-1978. In 2000, the combined strength of the two Sale Rotary 
		Clubs had settled to around the seventy mark.<br><br>Sale Rotary's 
		inaugural president, Bishop George Cranswick, was also its main founder. 
		As Bishop of Gippsland, Cranswick was well read, much travelled, and 
		thoroughly acquainted with the ideals of Rotary. He encouraged real 
		estate agent, Frank Chalmer, storekeeper Peter Jensen and others to 
		recruit prospective Sale Rotarians.<br><br>Fittingly, successive Bishops 
		of Gippsland have graced the Rotary Club of Sale over the decades, 
		including Bishops Blackwood, Sheumack, and most recently, Arthur Jones.<br>
		<br>Sale has had a strong tradition of sons of Rotarians and even a 
		son-in-law, following into Rotary. Inaugural member W.C.(Bill) Leslie 
		was followed by his son John. Hardware store proprietor Rex Castles was 
		followed by sons Bruce and Brian. All three Castles were members when 
		Rex was honoured as a Paul Harris Fellow in 1981. <br><br>Founding vice 
		president and second president R.M.(Bob) Rolland was followed by his 
		son-in-law Rob Cowie.<br><br>Rob Cowie, himself a president of Sale 
		Rotary, symbolised courage in the face of quite devastating adversity. 
		An horrific car accident took the life of his wife Helen (nee Rolland) 
		and left him severely crippled. Following rehabilitation, Rob returned 
		to the club, retaining an interest in all things Rotary. His spirit 
		inspired our whole Rotary family.<br><br>High achievers amongst Sale 
		Rotarians include Doug Riding, Officer Commanding RAAF Base East Sale 
		and later Deputy Chief of the Air Force; Neil McInnes, parliamentarian, 
		pilot and Royal Humane Society recipient; Peter Ryan, MLA, solicitor and 
		currently, leader of the National Party in Victoria; John Leslie, Mayor 
		of Sale, advisor and benefactor to the arts in Victoria; Honorary member 
		Dr. Clive Disher, a brigadier (retired list) who served in both world 
		wars.<br><br>The Rotary Club of Sale has conferred Paul Harris Fellows 
		on Rex Castles (1981), Cliff Gamlin (1982), Dr. Joe Crosbie (1983), Eric 
		Frith (1984), Ted Peirce (1986), John Leslie OBE (1987), Bill Stephenson 
		OBE (1988), Helen Cowie (1990), John Lewis (1992), Rob Cowie (1994), 
		Bishop Colin Sheumack (1995), Don Ripper (1996), Noel Langley (1996), 
		Max Morrison (1999), David Tulloch (1999).<br><br>The club's records 
		attest to allegiance to the four avenues of Rotary Service. Outstanding 
		achievements include: · Promoting the spread of Rotary in Gippsland, 
		notably through sponsoring Bairnsdale and Maffra Rotary Clubs.<br><br>· 
		Sponsoring the Rotary Club of Sale Central.<br><br>· Establishing the 
		Sale Apex Club.<br><br>· Forming both Mens and Ladies Probus Clubs in 
		Sale.<br><br>· Establishing the Sale Elderly Citizens' Village.<br><br>· 
		Setting up a Life Education caravan for Gippsland primary schools (lead 
		role).<br><br>· Achieving Rotary Reserve, Sale.<br><br>· Achieving the 
		restoration of the Sale Powder Magazine.<br><br>· Promoting Rotary Youth 
		Exchange.<br><br>A stand-out achievement has been the Sale Elderly 
		Citizens' Village. This project was officially opened by the Minister 
		for Social Services, the Hon. W. Wentworth (pictured) in 1972. Sale 
		Rotarians have had a major managerial role at this village over the past 
		thirty years.<br><br>Information provided by Peter Synan, 2002.&nbsp;</td>
