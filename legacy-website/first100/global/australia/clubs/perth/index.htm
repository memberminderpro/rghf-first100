		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/australia/clubs/perth/perth12apr1927_small.JPG" style="float: left">The 
		founding of Rotary on 23rd February 1905 in Chicago, was followed by the 
		movement becoming International in the Rotary year of 1911/12 with the 
		founding of a Club in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.<br><br>The first 
		Australian Clubs were the Melbourne Club (on 21st April 1921) and the 
		Sydney Club (on 7th May 1921).<br><br>It was not until 
		1926 that Perth was visited by the Special Commissioner for Australia, 
		Professor W. T. Osborne of Melbourne. Twenty five leading citizens of 
		Perth were invited to be inaugural members and the first luncheon was 
		held on 1st September 1926. The founding President was Sir William 
		Lathlain, a major Retailer in Perth and Mayor of Perth from 1919 – 1923.<br>
		<br>At a meeting on 22nd April 1927 the Club President Sir William 
		Lathlain, presented a cable from Chicago dated 20th April 1927, which 
		read as follows:<br>“Perth Club elected member Interotary April 
		Fifteenth Number Twenty Five Thirty Nine Congratulations.”<br><br>By 
		1928 all seventeen Clubs in Australia had become District 65 with Fred 
		Birks of the Rotary Club of Sydney as the first District Governor.<br>
		<br>The second President of the Rotary Club of Perth, Sinclair McGibbon, 
		became District Governor of the 65th District in 1932 – 33.<br><br>Thus 
		began the work of Service above Self in Western Australia, with over 
		1200 members passing through the ranks of the Rotary Club of Perth to 
		the present membership level of 120 business women and men.<br><br>Since 
		then the State of Western Australia has Clubs from Derby to Kununurra in 
		the North to Albany in the South and the State has seen the formation of 
		three Districts 9450 (Perth Club is in this District), 9460 and 9470.<br>
		<br>District 9450 has 41 Clubs with a total membership of 1241 as at 
		February 2001. The District Governor is as member of Port Hedland Club 
		which is approx 1700 road kms from Perth.<br><br>Perth Medical School<br><br>A Gala Dinner was held 
		in April 2002 to celebrate the 75th Birthday of the Perth Rotary Club, 
		with the Governor of Western Australia and Rotary Dignitaries in 
		attendance. <br><br>The celebration of 75 years of Rotary in Western 
		Australia recalled the many Club initiatives, with pride of place being 
		Rotary’s involvement in 1954/55 with the establishment of the Perth 
		Medical School. Previously all medical training was conducted interstate 
		or overseas. <br><br>On the International scene, since 1978 the Club has 
		been involved in the hosting of 36 overseas students and the sending of 
		37 Australian students overseas.<br><br>As another International 
		initiative the Rotary Club of Perth organised a project in Bangladesh to 
		introduce a Cyclone Early Warning System in an endeavor to save lives 
		from the effects of cyclones.<br><br>The project involved funds raised 
		by the Club and matching Grants from the Rotary Foundation and the 
		Australian Government. Management of the project was undertaken by the 
		Rotary Club of Dhaka.<br><br>In recent years the Club has established 
		(in partnership with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul) a centre in 
		Perth supporting youth from the streets. This house is named Bendat 
		House and was officially opened by Rotary International World President 
		James Lacey in 1999.<br><br>The Rotary Club of Perth has a sister 
		relationship with the Rotary Club of Singapore.<br><br>Passages Project 
		– Bendat House<br><br>ROTARY RETURNS TO CHINA<br><br>(Main article 
		appears in The Rotarian and Rotary Down Under April 2002)<br><br>&quot;When Rotarian Hermann 
		G. Heid, then Vice President of RC Hong Kong, visited our club in 1996, 
		he lobbied - as he had done many times with other Rotary Clubs - then 
		President David Reed for support in his efforts to re-establish Rotary 
		in China. Specifically, Hermann wanted to establish the Rotary Club of 
		Beijing.<br><br>While carefully trying to avoid collision with existing 
		written and unwritten Chinese Laws and Regulations on the one hand and 
		not to break any Rotary Rules, Heid knew that he needed to rally support 
		from as many Rotary corners as he could find. One of his strategies was 
		to have Rotarians and Rotary clubs from around the world lobby at RI 
		Headquarters for approval of a chartered Rotary Club.<br><br>Hermann 
		Heid, on behalf of RC Perth, presents PP Percy Chu the PHF needle and 
		medal.<br><br>
		David Reed immediately appointed then International Director Maurice 
		Rousset to liaise with Hermann Heid. In 1997 Hermann's fledging &quot;Beijing 
		Fellowship Group of Rotarians&quot;, as it was called then, honored the 
		oldest living Rotarian, Past President Percy Chu of Rotary Club Shanghai 
		(1934/35) at his 100th birthday. Percy had been introduced to Hermann by 
		David Reed. The Rotary Clubs Perth and Hong Kong both awarded PP Percy 
		Paul Harris Fellowships at the birthday event.<br><br>RC Perth 
		also arranged for Hermann to find a link to ROTARY DOWN UNDER which 
		published several articles and information about the China efforts in 
		its magazine. And through the introduction of RC Perth Hermann was 
		introduced to the newly elected RI Director Dr. Ken Collins who 
		ultimately became a vital supporter in Evanston of the Beijing 
		Fellowship Group.<br><br>When Hermann Heid left Beijing in 1999 he 
		became a member of the Rotary Club Perth. Even though physically removed 
		from China he continued his vigorous efforts to see that the Beijing 
		efforts remained on the agenda of Rotary International. In the process 
		he met and pleaded with many leading RI Directors and Presidents. The 
		break-through for recognition of the China groups within Rotary came 
		when Bhichai Rattakul was nominated to become RI President (2002-2003). 
		Hermann had built a solid relationship with Bhichai when he was Chairman 
		of Rotary's Asia Extension Committee.<br><br>In November 
		2000 a high ranking RI delegation, consisting of three RI Presidents - 
		Frank Devlyn, Rick King and Bhichai Rattakul - accompanied by several RI 
		Directors, including Ken Collins of Perth, and the General Secretary of 
		Rotary International, Ed Futa, visited China and met with Chinese 
		leaders. It was then that Hermann Heid knew that the return of Rotary to 
		China was imminent.<br><br>Upon return to Rotary Headquarters 
		and intensive deliberations the RI board unanimously extended 
		&quot;provisional&quot; status to the Rotary groups in Beijing and Shanghai. In 
		June 2001 both Chinese cities once again have Rotary Clubs 
		(Provisional). Full chartering is expected once the Chinese government 
		has passed laws governing non-governmental organisations.<br><br>For his 
		work for the return of Rotary to China Hermann was made a lifetime 
		honorary member of the RC Beijing and he received a PHF from RC Hong 
		Kong.&quot;<br><br>This entire section was prepared by Rotary Global 
		History board member, Australia project chair, the late PDG John Louttit
