		The decision to form the Rotary Club of North Sydney was made at a 
		meeting held in the Board Room of the North Shore Gas Company on 24 May 
		1928 in the presence of the President and several members of the Rotary 
		Club of Sydney formed just seven years earlier in 1921. The Club was 
		chartered on 16 August 1928 as Club No.2952 and the 19th Club chartered 
		in Australia as part of District 65 which covered the whole continent. 
		Sam Janes (later District Governor) was the first President with a club 
		membership of just 18 members. It formed the Inner Wheel Club of North 
		Sydney in December 1932, the second Inner Wheel Club to be formed in 
		Australia.<br><br>Current membership numbers about 75 having reached a 
		maximum membership of 130 in 1970. Between the end of World War II and 
		about 1975 it ceded territory to directly form 6 new clubs from which 
		all 68 clubs in District 9680 have been developed. Eight members have 
		served Rotary International as District Governors.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="405" src="1935paulharriswithmembers.jpg" style="float: left" width="500">On 14 March 
		1935 the Club welcomed Paul Harris, the Founder of Rotary, to its 
		meeting following which he planted a memorial tree (Queensland 
		fire-wheel) in nearby St Leonards Park, after which a photograph 
		recording the occasion was taken in the grandstand of North Sydney Oval 
		next door. In September 1949, when the tree was some 15 years old (it 
		still lives into the 21st century), and following the death of Paul 
		Harris in January 1947, a commemorative plaque was placed at the base of 
		the tree. A second fire-wheel tree was planted nearby in August 1978 by 
		the then R.I. President, 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1978renouf/">Clem Renouf</a>, on the occasion of the Club’s 
		Golden Anniversary.<br><br>After meeting at the Milsons Point Hotel for 
		the first 12 months the Club met for 30 years at the Crows Nest Hotel, 
		then for 15 years at the North Sydney Police Boys Club followed by 4 
		years at the Cammeray Golf Club and since 1978 the venue for all weekly 
		meetings has been the North Sydney Leagues Club, only five meeting 
		places, during the Club’s 75 years, since its charter was received.<br>
		<br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="279" src="1949plaqueatree.jpg" style="float: left" width="500">For the first six years until July 1934 the Club did not produce its 
		own weekly bulletin. During that time minutes of each meeting were kept 
		and members received, monthly, a copy of “Pinion” produced by its 
		“mother”, the Rotary Club of Sydney. Issue No.1 of “Cogs”, the Club’s 
		weekly bulletin in the form of a 4 page printed “magazine”, is dated 5 
		June 1934 and continued in that form for 7½ years, the last Issue being 
		No.356 dated 9 December 1941 when for reasons of war and paper shortage 
		publication was suspended. However, on 28 March 1944 Issue No.357 rolled 
		off the presses, again in a magazine format, which by and large has 
		continued since then for some 60 years. Except for public holidays and 
		special occasions “Cogs” has been produced weekly about 49 times each 
		year such that by mid 2002 when these history notes were prepared Issue 
		No.3215 was current. Commencing in the late 1970s the District has made 
		an annual award for Club Bulletins with North Sydney winning that award 
		on four occasions.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="691" src="1949dedicationofthetree.jpg" style="float: left" width="500">The Club has been a strong supporter of the 
		Rotary Foundation through several of its activities. It has nominated 
		successfully two Rotary Ambassadorial Scholars, provided three team 
		leaders for overseas Group Study Exchanges, actively participated in the 
		3H and Polio Plus Programmes and, through the Paul Harris Fellows scheme 
		has directly financed the recognition of more that 70 Paul Harris 
		Fellows, six of whom have also been recognised with a Sapphire Pin. 
		Approximately one third of those 70 have been non-Rotarians of whom 
		about half have been women.<br><br>In 1994 the Club established, with 
		matching grants from the Rotary Foundation, a facility in Uganda for the 
		manufacture and supply of low cost appliances such as calipers, clogs 
		and crutches to physically disabled children and teenagers. A second 
		grant was received some seven years later to expand this highly 
		successful venture.<br>After several years of hesitation following 
		R.I.’s decision to admit women into Rotary the Club elected its first 
		female member in 1989 who then served as President in 1995?1996. Since 
		then the Club has had a second lady President, in 2000-2001. Both are 
		Paul Harris Fellows, the second also receiving a Sapphire Pin in 2002.<br>
		<br>Earlier in the Club’s life the great depression created many 
		opportunities for service to the needy in the community then shortly 
		afterwards World War II provided a greater range of service 
		opportunities. One of the service to youth activities in that era was 
		the major participation in the establishment of a training centre (camp) 
		for Boy Scouts in north western Sydney. During the post war years of the 
		1950s and 1960s disadvantaged children were entertained at Sydney’s Luna 
		Park when the Club took over that venue on a Friday night twice each 
		year. A major air-show was organised in 1969 to raise funds for local 
		charities. This successfully increased the awareness of Rotary in the 
		community at that time.<br><br>In 1981 the Rotary Club of North Sydney 
		Benevolent Fund was established with some $300,000 since then 
		distributed to various charities and, in 1982, the Allan Stephens North 
		Sydney Rotary Trust was set in place to support research into cancer and 
		arthritis with more than $120,000 having been provided in its first 20 
		years. In 2001 the Club donated a bus for the Hope Healthcare Tom 
		O’Neill Centre to transport dementia sufferers and their carers.<br><br>
		In March 1983 the Club sponsored the Probus Club of North Sydney. In 
		1967 a Rotaract Club was formed and it flourished for about a dozen 
		years before a steady decline in member numbers led to its closure in 
		1982. Two unsuccessful attempts were made over the next decade to get it 
		going again.<br><br>Current on-going local community services include 
		for more than 25 years the management and co-ordination of the North 
		Sydney Regional Centre for the Annual Salvation Army Red Shield Appeal; 
		for some two decades the distribution of food hampers in July and at 
		Christmas to needy and elderly citizens in the North Sydney area; and 
		for ten years, the operation of the Rotary Markets at the Crowns Nest 
		Community Centre on the 3rd Saturday of each month.<br><br>In the late 
		1970s Rotary District 9680 established an award, the District Governor’s 
		Shield, to be presented annually to the club with the best “all round” 
		performance. The Rotary Club of North Sydney has since then won the 
		Shield twice, in 1982-1983 and in 2000-2001. It has a proven record and 
		completes 75 years of service in 2003 and looks forward with confidence 
		to continuing that service for another 25 years…at least. Malcolm S 
		Nicklin PHF Past President 1982-1983&nbsp;</td>
