		the formation of the Rotary Club of Sydney, in 1921, a group of Sydney 
		Rotarians visited Newcastle in May 1923 with the aim of sponsoring a 
		Rotary Club in the second city of the State of New South Wales. They 
		were successful in their effort and the inaugural meeting was held on 
		3rd September, at the George Hotel in Newcastle’s CBD. The Rotary Club 
		of Newcastle was chartered on 19th December 1923.<br><br>The Charter 
		President was General John Paton and there were a total of 20 charter 
		members. A number of these served with distinction in the First World 
		War, including the President, the foundation secretary, Dr. Idris Morgan 
		and the foundation treasurer, Colonel Brent Rodd.<br><br>Members 
		of the club quickly commenced various forms of community service. Brent 
		Rodd was involved in the Boy Scouts movement and became District 
		Commissioner, a post that he held for many years. During the Great 
		Depression, it was found that many Diggers would not be able to attend 
		Anzac Day parades because they only had shabby clothes. A collection of 
		clothes by Rotary members was distributed to those returned servicemen 
		in need.<br><br>In 1925, club members commenced an annual project of 
		providing Christmas cheer for needy families and, in 1931, 138 families 
		were helped in this way. In 1930 regular picnics were arranged for 
		hearing impaired children and children from other institutions. These 
		outings used members’ cars and continued till 1960.<br><br>An inter-city 
		conference, the first in the History in Australia, was held at the 
		Toronto Hotel, near Newcastle, in 1926. Ninety Rotarians from Sydney, 
		Parramatta and Newcastle took part and one of the proposals was to form 
		a Rotary District, under a district governor, in Australia.<br><br>The 
		Rotary Bell (or “Gong”), used at Club meetings, was the gift of the 
		Rotary Club of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK, and was presented to the Club in 
		April, 1932.<br><br>The Rotary Club of Newcastle set up an organisation 
		to identify and help physically handicapped children. A public meeting 
		was held in 1932 from which the Newcastle and District Association for 
		Crippled Children was launched. Rotarians filled all offices in the 
		Association for many years and they also contributed resources for the 
		operation of the organisation. Four hundred children were always under 
		the Association’s care. In 1949, a holiday home for crippled children 
		was purchased on the shores of Lake Macquarie. The Club continues to 
		support this facility today, with an annual Golf Day fundraiser.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="365" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/australia/clubs/newcastle/newcastletree.jpg" style="float: left" width="500">In 
		1935, Paul Harris visited Newcastle and planted a tree in Civic Park, 
		opposite the City Hall, to commemorate the District Conference that he 
		attended. The District Governor at the time was Tom Armstrong, a past 
		president of the Rotary Club of Newcastle. In his book, 
		“Peregrinations”, written after his Pacific journey, Paul Harris 
		referred to his visit to Newcastle in glowing terms.<br><br>Major 
		activities from 1935 to 1938 included a movement to establish a Cultural 
		Centre comprising library facilities, an art gallery and museum. After a 
		period of negotiation for use of a suitable building the onset of the 
		Second World War caused the project to be deferred. It was re-activated 
		in 1946 in conjunction with a move to have a branch of the Sydney 
		Conservatorium of Music established in Newcastle. The expanded project 
		eventuated as the War Memorial Cultural Centre with a floor devoted to 
		the Conservatorium.<br><br>The Rotary Club of Newcastle takes pride in 
		the clubs it has sponsored, as well as the many clubs that they in turn 
		have sponsored. The first club to be sponsored was Maitland, in 1931, 
		followed by Tamworth in 1932 and Armidale in 1933. Many others followed, 
		including further inner city clubs; Newcastle West and Newcastle 
		Sunrise. The bond with Maitland club has been fostered by an annual 
		inter-club visit where the Rotary meeting is followed by a lawn bowls 
		challenge between the clubs.<br><br>In 1962, after a visit to Brisbane, 
		PP Eric Armstrong suggested the adoption of the Rotary Youth Leadership 
		Award (R.Y.L.A.) programme as a project for the club. The programme was 
		developed from a fairly basic foundation established in Queensland and 
		has been used by our Rotary District ever since. It became a model for 
		adoption by other Rotary Districts in Australia. Newcastle Rotary Club 
		continues to assist with running this programme.<br><br>Newcastle Rotary 
		Club has always been involved in youth service. An early example was at 
		the height of the Great Depression, in 1931, when the plight of 
		unemployed youth was of great concern to Newcastle Rotarians who set out 
		to keep them occupied with recreational and instructional activities. 
		This led to the establishment of the Young Citizens’ League (Newcastle), 
		which provided for the educational, social and moral needs of unemployed 
		youth. Another example of youth service was the construction in 1970-71, 
		by members of the club, of a camp for Girl Guides in bush land near 
		Clarencetown, in the Williams River Valley, north of Newcastle. The Club 
		has also supported the Youth Exchange programme for many years.<br><br>
		The needs of retired professional and business people was recognised by 
		Rotary with formation of Probus Clubs and in 1984, the Newcastle 
		Rotarians launched Newcastle Probus Club. The most recent Probus Club to 
		be sponsored by Newcastle Rotary Club was the Merewether Probus Club in 
		1997.<br><br>On December 28th, 1989, Newcastle suffered a major 
		earthquake, the first in Australia to cause loss of life. Extensive 
		damage was done to shops, business premises and private homes in the 
		Central Business District and in the suburb of Hamilton. A special 
		committee was set up to address the needs of people severely affected by 
		the earthquake and $120,000 was raised, including donations from all 
		over the world, which was distributed through the major community 
		service groups.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="337" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/australia/clubs/newcastle/ubesister1.jpg" style="float: left" width="500">A 
		significant international service event occurred in 1990 when the 
		President of the Rotary Club of Ube, Japan, and the President of the 
		Rotary Club of Newcastle signed a Sister Club Agreement to foster 
		inter-club relationships. During his speech to the meeting, the Ube 
		President spoke of his involvement with the preparations for the raid by 
		Japanese midget submarines on Sydney and Newcastle during the Second 
		World War. The visit by members of Ube Rotary Club and the signing of 
		the sister club agreement demonstrated the goodwill that now exists 
		between these two sister cities.<br><br>Another example of international 
		service is the club’s support of the Ranfurly Library, a scheme to 
		collect second hand books for delivery to schools, libraries and welfare 
		agencies in developing countries of the South West Pacific Region.<br><br>The club’s vocational service 
		activities have included the “Teachers in Business” programme, 
		introduced in 1990, where club members arranged for the placement of 
		school teachers in their business for a period of three weeks, to gain 
		experience in a field of business which interests them and would assist 
		them in their teaching profession. Currently, the Club supports the 
		“Shell Livewire” mentoring programme for people establishing new small 
		businesses. In 1987, the Club commenced the annual presentation of 
		“Pride of Workmanship” awards to recognise excellence in vocational 
		service by members of the community<br><br>In 1997, a literacy programme 
		was commenced at Carrington Public School. Newcastle Rotarians and 
		friends visit the school once a week to assist young children to develop 
		reading skills.<br><br>The club is proud of its support for the Rotary 
		Foundation and, between 1976 and 2002, there have been 48 Paul Harris 
		Fellowships presented by the club.&nbsp;</td>
