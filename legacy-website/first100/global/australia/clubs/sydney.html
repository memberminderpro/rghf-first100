		was in 1921 that two Special Commissioners arrived in Australia with 
		credentials from the Board of the International Association of Rotary 
		Clubs in Chicago, to establish Rotary in Australia and New Zealand. They 
		were James W. Davidson, FRGS, Past President of the Rotary Club of 
		Calgary, and Lieutenant Colonel J. Layton Ralston, CMG. DSO. KC, 
		President of the Rotary Club of Halifax. The Canadian contribution, with 
		expertise and part cost, to the establishment of Rotary in Australasia 
		was very significant. At that time there were only 800 clubs in the 
		United States, Canada and the British Isles.<br><br>Graphic: &quot;The Rotary 
		Club of Sydney 1921-81&quot; by PDG Alex Mitchell<br><br>When the Rotary Club 
		of Sydney held its inaugural meeting on 7 May 1921, with 35 members, 
		they elected Sir Henry Braddon as the President. He was the Managing 
		Director of Dalgety &amp; Co., a major wool broking company and had gained 
		some knowledge of Rotary when he was in the office of the Trade 
		Commission of the Commonwealth of Australia in New York in 1919. Sir 
		Henry had the special distinction of having been “capped” by both the 
		Australian and New Zealand Rugby Unions.<br><br>The first Vice President 
		elected was Dr. Arthur E. Mills, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at 
		Sydney University. The members were a cross-section of professions and 
		business activities, and the criterion for eligibility of members was 
		broadly, one member from each vocational classification.<br><br>In 1935 
		Paul Harris planted a Friendship Tree at Sydney.<br><br>Observing the 
		many projects undertaken by the Club in later years – such as the 
		foundation of the NSW Crippled Children’s Society (now the Northcott 
		Society) and the Police Rotary Boys’ Club (now The Police and Community 
		Youth Clubs) – it was not surprising that the very first service 
		activity was to organise an outing to the seaside for 120 children and 
		their nurse from the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children in November 
		1921. There followed similar activities until in 1924 the first major 
		project, Boys’ Week, was undertaken. This culminated in considerable 
		support for the Boys’ Brigade and a new building at Pyrmont.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style28" src="sydney/sydneyclubpicnic.jpg" style="float: left">By 
		1926 the Rotary Club of Sydney was establishing Rotary Clubs widely 
		throughout New South Wales and Queensland. There has been considerable 
		growth in the Club and for most of the last 50 years the membership has 
		been over 300. It remains the largest Club in Australia. Its territory, 
		which initially comprised an area within an 80 mile radius of the city 
		centre, is now concentrated in the central business district of the city 
		and is shared with three new city clubs – Sydney Cove and Sydney CBD, 
		both chartered by the Rotary Club of Sydney, and Darling Harbour, 
		co-chartered with the Rotary Club of Sydney Cove.<br><br>The Club hosted 
		the 62nd Rotary International
		<a href="/first100/presidents/conventions/1971">
		Convention in May 1971</a>, some 17,220 delegates attended this first 
		Convention to be held in Australia.<br><br>Major projects initiated over 
		the years by the Rotary Club of Sydney include the Free Library 
		Movement, which led to a significant expansion of free lending libraries 
		throughout New South Wales; the Australian Administrative Staff College 
		at Mount Eliza (now the Mt Eliza Business School); the Old Peoples’ 
		Welfare Council (now the NSW Council for the Ageing); and the chartering 
		of the Probus Club of Sydney. In recent years the Club has contributed 
		large sums to the support of The Sydney Children’s Hospital ICU for 
		babies, to the Sir David Martin Foundation Triple Care Farm, for 
		disadvantaged youths who come before the Courts, and to the StreetSmart 
		Project, an outreach centre for young homeless people, in conjunction 
		with the Wesley Central Mission.<br><br>Contributions by way of personal 
		service and financial support have been made in substantial measure to 
		the Alzheimer’s Association, to the Sydney Eye Hospital, to the 
		Microsearch Foundation of Australia, a pioneering micro-surgery research 
		and training facility, to Habitat for Humanity, a church program to 
		build houses for poor families, to Dr. Barnardo’s Homes and to the 
		Spinesafe Education Program. Two recent major initiatives of the Club 
		were Business in the Community (now Business Enterprise Centres) and the 
		Ranfurly Library Service, which provides reading material for schools 
		and hospitals throughout the South Pacific.<br><br>A major ongoing 
		project each year is the “Your City Program”, which provides city 
		experience in all its diversity to senior country students. Other 
		ongoing projects include RYLA, RYPEN, GSE and Rotary Youth Exchange. The 
		“Adrian Golding Gift of Life Program”, established in honour of a 
		deceased member, sponsors young children from the Pacific Islands who 
		are facing severe surgical or medical problems untreatable in their own 
		countries to visit Australia for remedial treatment.<br><br>Over the 
		last two years, the Club has organised a Corporate and Business Leaders’ 
		Dinner at the Art Gallery of NSW to coincide with the Archibald 
		Exhibition. The purpose of this dinner is to introduce Sydney’s business 
		leaders to the Rotary Club of Sydney and to focus on partnerships with 
		the business community to develop worthwhile community projects. Funds 
		raised from these dinners exceeded $188,000, benefiting the Spastic 
		Centre of New South Wales’ Conductive Education Program for children 
		born with cerebral palsy.<br><br>There are also ongoing “service awards” 
		made each year to recognise leaders and achievers in the community, in 
		their vocation, in education and amongst handicapped people. These 
		awards honour the recipients’ contribution to society, exemplifying 
		Rotary’s motto “Service Above Self”.<br><br>In the year 2000, the City 
		of Sydney was the venue for the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games 
		and the Club contributed in various ways to the great success of the 
		occasion – eg. by initiating and developing a Home Hosting Program for 
		athletes and their families; by actively encouraging Rotary Clubs 
		throughout the State to sponsor local children to attend the 
		Paralympics; and by fund-raising to purchase Paralympics tickets for 
		donation to various charitable organisations.<br><br>
		<a href="/first100/clubs/cities/">Female members</a> 
		were first inducted into the Club in 1990 and for the year 2002-03 the 
		Club has elected its first female President.<br><br>
		<a href="sydney/sydneymembers.JPG" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="188" src="sydney/sydneymembers.JPG" style="float: left" width="126"></a>The 
		President’s Project for 2001-02 was for the provision of funds towards 
		development of the “Lifestart Program” a family-centred program and 
		family support facility for young children with an intellectual 
		disability or developmental delay for which $170,000 was raised.<br><br>
		The Club’s History has been written by PDG Alex Mitchell, CBE in two 
		volumes. The first, 1921-1981, is out of print but the second volume, 
		1982-1991, is available from the Club’s office. Both volumes are 
		available in NSW city libraries and the National Library, Canberra.<br>
