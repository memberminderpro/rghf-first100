		<img class="auto-style26" src="wollongong/wollongongbanner.jpg" style="float: left">Following the formation of Sydney Club in 1921, and the 
		subsequent sponsoring of Newcastle (1923) and Parramatta (1926), it 
		seemed only by natural sequence that the Rotary movement should extend 
		to Wollongong. About the beginning of 1927, Fred Burley, a very keen 
		Sydney Club Rotarian, enthused local identities Percy Pratt and Charles 
		Jackson with the potential of Rotary for the area covering Port Kembla, 
		Wollongong and surrounding towns.<br><br>The concept was received 
		enthusiastically and an informal luncheon was held at 1.00 pm on 1 June 
		1927 at Miss Davies’ Charlton Café, downstairs on the south side of 
		Crown Street, Wollongong. Present at the meeting were Bob Craig 
		(Australian Fertilisers Ltd), Robbie Musgrave (Illawarra Mercury), Billy 
		David (David’s Foundry), Vorn Wilson (Dentist), Waldo Lance (Lance’s), 
		Bob Bevan (Real Estate), Noel Kirkwood (GP), Harry Wright (Commonwealth 
		Bank), Jim Russell (Law), Jim Caddy (M.M. Ltd) and Sid Barber 
		(Wollongong High School). Ben Gelling, Fred Burley and Bill Holden from 
		Sydney Club guided the path of these intending members as there was no 
		Rotary District or District Governor.<br><br>Weekly meetings continued 
		to be held, an application for Rotary status was made in July, official 
		Rotary Charter was granted in September and preparations were made for 
		Charter Night, which took place on 10 December 1927 in St. Michael's 
		Parish Hall. On that night, ladies were present for the first time.<br>
		<br>Rotary in the 30s: This was a decade of rapid growth and momentous 
		occasions in the life of the Club. In 1932, the Club was instrumental in 
		the formation of Wollongong and District Children’s Society, and as each 
		Rotary Club has come into existence in the area, it has in turn 
		supported the Society. This commenced with the formation of Goulburn 
		Club in 1930 (in conjunction with Canberra) and Nowra Club in 1935.<br>
		<br>Rotary in the 40s: This was a decade of service above self to ease 
		the problems in a war torn world. In 1940, the sum of 12,000 pounds was 
		raised to buy a Spitfire to help in the Battle of Britain. A continuous 
		clothing drive took place over several years to dispatch clothing 
		overseas. In 1947, the City of Greater Wollongong ‘Food for Britain’ was 
		sponsored by Rotarians, and some 9 000 food parcels were packed and 
		dispatched to Britain. These were distributed to the aged and invalid 
		through Rotary International in Britain. Despite the problems of war, 
		Rotary continued to thrive in the local area with Bowral Club sponsored 
		in 1940, Port Kembla in 1946, Camden in 1947 and Bulli in 1948.<br><br>
		Rotary in the 50s: With the Australian immigration policy under way, the 
		Club rendered valuable to support the New Settler’s League in the 
		assimilation of ‘new’ Australians. In 1953, the Club felt very proud 
		when George Coghlan was elected District Governor nominee for the year 
		1953-54. In the same year, an appeal for a sub-normal children’s 
		association was made and 8000 pounds was raised.<br><br>In 1955, the 
		lookouts and roads for access to the summit of Mt. Keira commenced. 
		Built against formidable odds, these stand as one of the Club’s greatest 
		achievements. Bush walks and amenities were provided and the area is now 
		recognised as having some of the finest views in the world. The Rotary 
		family tree continued to grow with Kiama being sponsored in 1952 and 
		Dapto in 1959.<br><br>Rotary in the 60s: This was a decade during which 
		Rotary did a great deal for youth in the community with debating 
		competitions, Eisteddfod prizes, scholarship awards and careers 
		information programs all strongly supported. Presidents Bill Dyer, Bill 
		Kelly and Russ Jones saw in their respective years the introduction of 
		Interact, Code and Rotaract Clubs. Annual golf days became big charity 
		occasions. The International House appeal was very successful, and 
		Rotary Park became a major project. In 1964, the Rotary Club of West 
		Wollongong was sponsored.<br><br>Rotary in the 70s: The outstanding 
		event in this period was the launching of the Television Hiring Scheme 
		at Wollongong Hospital. It started with 10 fourteen-inch black and white 
		sets mounted on trolleys so that they could be wheeled from room to 
		room. The service continued for almost twenty years and raised nearly 
		$150,000 worth of equipment for the hospital. In addition through Radio 
		2WL, a highly successful radiothon was conducted raising $56 000 for the 
		complete refurbishment of the Children’s Ward at the Wollongong 
		Hospital. This also continued for a number of years.<br><br>Rotary in 
		the 80s and 90s: The achievements and progress of the Rotary Club of 
		Wollongong in the last twenty five years are best shown by the list of 
		major projects which cover the four avenues of service:-<br><br>· 
		Interact – formed at Keira High School and still in existence · Inner 
		Wheel – chartered in 1961 and providing further assistance to local 
		charities · Probus – direct involvement in formation of five Clubs with 
		associations to another ten · Group Study Exchange – involvement since 
		1980 with both incoming and outgoing teams · Youth Exchange – ten 
		overseas students hosted and nine outgoing students supported since 1968 
		· <br><br>Wollongong Hospital Auxiliary – operated for twenty years up 
		to 1994 · Mt Keira Access – provision of access to summit overlooking 
		south coast · Shopping Nights – operating since 1986 to provide special 
		Christmas shopping night for elderly and disabled · Scout Camp – 
		improvement and maintenance to buildings and surrounds · Girl Guide Camp 
		– development and maintenance of area particularly after recent flood 
		damage · Christmas Trailer Raffle – commenced in 1985 raising over 
		$15,000 per year · <br><br>Breakfast on the Beach – provision of a 
		community breakfast since 1993 · Customs House - renovation of historic 
		building on town foreshores · Carlennium – provision of breakfast for 
		entrants and participation in fund raising activities for Shepherd 
		Centre for deaf children · Tree Planting – McCabe Park, Bob Jessop Grove 
		and Summit Tank come to mind, though more recently the development of 
		Greenhouse Park as a major memorial to the Club’s 75th year in 2002/3 
		will convert a building tip to a green buffer zone between the 
		industrial and commercial centres.&nbsp;</td>
