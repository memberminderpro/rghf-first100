		<img class="auto-style26" height="82" src="parramatta/logo_parra_top.gif" style="float: left" width="97">Paul Harris' Essay on the International nature of Rotary, written at 
		Parramatta.<br><br>Parramatta was not the bustling city it is today in 1926 
		when Rotary came to the then market town. The highlight of Parramatta's 
		week was the weekly auction sales on Mondays and Thursdays of livestock, 
		vegetables, fruit and goods of all kinds. Businesses were locally owned 
		and business leaders lived in Parramatta making it a fertile place for 
		Rotary ideals.<br><br>
		Representatives from the Rotary Club of Sydney came in 1926 and met 
		prospective Rotarians at the historic Woolpack Hotel. Twelve prospective 
		Rotarians were identified and a further meeting was arranged for the 
		next week. HW Sheppard and JC Browning worked tirelessly during this 
		week and the twenty members required were achieved. A submission was 
		made to Rotary International and the Rotary Club of Parramatta was 
		officially admitted on 20 June 1926 with HW (Hank) Sheppard a well 
		respected local solicitor being Charter President. He was a man of high 
		ideals and ensured the Club became an ornament to Rotary's best 
		aspirations.<br><br>The Club supported local needs but its greatest 
		efforts during its early years were directed to supporting the Rotary 
		Club of Sydney's great initiative in establishing the NSW Crippled 
		Children's Society. The Parramatta Club established a class for crippled 
		children in Parramatta using the hall at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church 
		and volunteer Rotary drivers for transport. The Northcott School for 
		Crippled Children later absorbed this class.<br><br>One of its unique 
		features was the great fellowship and the singing of members. Two 
		members, Jack Ritchie and Harry Grainger, who had fine voices provided 
		leadership and it is recorded in notices that the Club choir met for 
		practise on Monday evenings in preparation for the Wednesday meetings.<br>
		<br>Another unique feature for the first twenty years was the services 
		to the Club by Miss L Kaylock. This lady secretary to Rotarian Alexander 
		attended every meeting, wrote the minutes of every weekly meeting in 
		long hand and prepared a report for the local newspaper the Parramatta 
		Argus. Was she in spirit at least the first lady Rotarian? She certainly 
		exemplified the motto Service Above Self.<br><br>The Club did not live 
		unto itself. It soon sponsored new clubs at Bathurst and Burwood. 
		Despite this it grew to over one hundred members because of the large 
		area covered. It continued to support the growth of new clubs, two of 
		which are in Parramatta. Parramatta North (now Parramatta City) in 1972 
		and the joint sponsorship with Parramatta City of the Rotary Club of 
		Parramatta Daybreak in 1992.<br><br>There was no greater occasion in the 
		early life of the Rotary Club of Parramatta than 10 April 1935 when Paul 
		and Jean Harris visited the Club. The Carolean Reception Centre and Roxy 
		Theatre were the scenes for Rotarians and spouses (separate of course as 
		was the custom of the time) to greet Rotary's founder and his wife - it 
		was a grand occasion for all. A tree planted by Paul on that day in 
		Prince Alfred Park bears testimony to this visit.<br><br>After World War 
		11 the City of Parramatta changed from its earlier market day, 
		semi-rural image to a thriving financial, retail and administrative 
		centre. Many residences of earlier years were acquired and Rotarians 
		tended to move to adjoining northern suburbs. This has changed the 
		earlier residential family centred club to a more business centred club 
		with both male and female members. The Club has continued to sponsor 
		other clubs rather than maintain its once large membership.<br><br>All 
		aspects of service continue to be strongly emphasised with rewards for 
		vocational achievement, a steady flow of exchange students, interest in 
		the worthy causes of the city and meetings that are always worthy of the 
		Object of Rotary. One of the highlights of each year is the highly 
		respected Public Speaking Competition for the ES &amp; AM Clift Shield. The 
		late EM Clift, the donor of the shield, was a member of the Club 
		continuously for 63 years (1928-1991). This competition for secondary 
		students has greatly assisted many students in the art of public 
		speaking.<br><br>In 2001 the Rotary Club of Parramatta celebrated 
		seventy five years of service to the Parramatta community and worldwide 
		programs of Rotary with a special very well attended function, when a 
		host of memories were recalled and there was an opportunistic dedication 
		to future service. The Rotary Club of Parramatta has been an important 
		part of the life of the City of Parramatta and will continue, in 
		conjunction with the other two Parramatta Clubs to remain a positive and 
		enriching influence in that city's future and the wider programs of 
		Rotary.&nbsp;</td>
