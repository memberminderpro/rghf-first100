		<img class="auto-style26" src="charterpresidentjonesedit.jpg" style="float: left"></a>A visit by two Ambassadors from the Rotary Club of 
		Melbourne led to the formation of the Rotary Club of Hobart. Professor 
		Osborne of Melbourne University and Walter Drummond, Secretary of the 
		Melbourne Club, came to Hobart armed with a list of 25 names who were 
		regarded as prospective members of a new club<br><br>Among those listed 
		was Sir Henry Jones, a local industrialist who was the Chief of IXL 
		Limited, a company of international reputation. Sir Henry agreed to be 
		the founding President of the Club.<br><br>The first meeting of the Club 
		was held at the Imperial Hotel, Collins, Street, Hobart in the presence 
		of the original 23 charter members on 29th February 1924. The list of 
		charter members read like a record of the Hobart “establishment” which 
		was to ensure that the aims and ideals of the Rotary movement were in 
		good care to guarantee its success.<br><br>By the end of the first year, 
		membership had grown to 45 members. The Club had become very active 
		developing income to assist in providing amenities for the Blind, Deaf 
		and Dumb Society and giving support to the Boy Scout movement.<br><br>
		The 1927-28 year was notable for the fact that the Club was part of the 
		founding membership of the 65th Rotary District comprising 17 clubs from 
		Australia.<br><br>In March 1935 the Club was honoured to receive a visit 
		from Paul Harris, the founder of Rotary, and his wife, Jean. During his 
		visit Paul planted a tree in Hobart’s St David’s Park. The tree, which 
		bears a plaque recording the visit, still flourishes and has grown to 
		very large proportions.<br><br>Club activities continued to support 
		local projects too various in nature to enumerate. The intervention of 
		the Second World War had its affect on membership numbers. Nevertheless, 
		the club allied itself to the Australian Comforts Fund and played a 
		substantial role in the provision and packing of parcels for the support 
		of members of the armed forces.<br><br>After the Declaration of Peace 
		such efforts were directed towards support for the Food for Britain 
		Appeal to ease the plight of residents of “the Old Dart”.<br>When conditions were 
		normalized the Club developed a camp at Taroona to provide a holiday 
		facility for under privileged children. The camp operated for many years 
		until such time it outlived its usefulness. The property was sold for 
		$35,500.00 and the proceeds were invested to provide income to support 
		youth projects. The capital has grown considerably over the years and 
		the income is put to good use.<br><br>In 1963 the Club paid a leading 
		role in the establishment and building of the “Sixty and Over Club”. 
		This facility is located in the Hobart CBD and was the forerunner to 
		other amenities for the support of our elder citizens.<br><br>The Hobart 
		Club has participated in the extension of 6 other clubs in the area. Our 
		own membership, which peaked at 123 in 1985, now hovers around the 95 
		mark, which is more manageable for a lunchtime club.<br><br>In recent 
		years the Club pioneered the introduction of a programme to assist small 
		enterprises which need expert guidance to steer them through a difficult 
		period. This is achieved through assistance rendered by volunteers who 
		in the main are retired businessmen or women who freely give of their 
		time to those who are struggling. This mentoring has been taken up by 
		other states with equal success.<br><br>Another initiative of the Club 
		is the support given to surgeons from Pacific Island countries, wherein 
		the techniques of plastic surgery are passed on to them during a period 
		of residency in Hobart. Club member, Dr Miki Pohl, who is skilled in 
		this field, has played a leading role in this programme.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style27" src="http://www.rghf.xyz/first100/global/australia/clubs/hobart/lewisphfwithlouttitsandblender.JPG" style="float: left">In 
		taking a leading role in the introduction of new ideas and ongoing 
		support, the Hobart Rotary Club is very proud of its contribution it has 
		made to the local community in its 78 year history.<br><br>Active 
		participation by members in club projects is the very core of Rotary 
		ideals and we are grateful to those members who by their participation 
		have worked tirelessly for the benefit of all.<br><br>This entire 
		section was prepared by Rotary Global History board member, Australia 
		project chair, the late 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/historians/pastcommittee/louttit.htm">PDG John Louttit</a> 24 July 2003<br><br>Whilst in 
		Tasmania Paul commented in an address that despite living in Chicago 
		with its notoriety for crime, he had never been held up.<br><br>During 
		his journey from Hobart to Launceston, a number of Hobart Rotarians 
		suitably attired as desperadoes and brandishing pistols and shotguns, 
		obliged by holding up the founder of Rotary.<br><br>Thereafter on many 
		occasions on which he addressed gatherings he referred to the experience 
		of his one and only hold up occurring during his visit to Tasmania. The 
		photo, on the left records the event. (click &amp; enlarge the image)</td>
