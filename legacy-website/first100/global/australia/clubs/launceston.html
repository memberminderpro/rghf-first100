		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">When the Rotary Club of Launceston 
		Tasmania was chartered in August 1924 the island state of Australia had 
		a population of only 200,000 and was planning the centenary of 
		separation from New South Wales in 1825. It was only a decade after the 
		first aeroplane flight to Tasmania and 12 years before a submarine cable 
		would link the state to mainland Australia, enabling telephone 
		conversations from Tasmania to Victoria. A depression, so severe that 50 
		percent of breadwinners had no jobs, gripped the land and Sir Hubert 
		Opperman set a cycling record of five hours and fifty nine minutes along 
		a blue stone road from Launceston to Hobart ( more than 200 kilometres)<br>
		<br>The leaders of commerce and industry at that time were fine, 
		benevolent, industrious and God- fearing men who with their families 
		typically attended church on Sundays, dressed in their best tailored 
		suits, wore felt hats and most of them smoked pipes. It was observed in 
		a book written by a club member Sir Raymond Ferrall that in those days 
		“only men who smoked a pipe were considered steadfast and trustworthy”.<br>
		<br>So it was to a town of 30000 people that Professor W A Osborne and 
		Mr W A Drummond secretary of the then recently (1921) formed Rotary Club 
		of Melbourne Victoria brought the idea of forming a Rotary club in 
		Tasmania. They received little encouragement for several weeks until 
		they met (Sir) Doctor John Ramsay in Launceston and as a result of his 
		enthusiasm on February 18th 1924 the Rotary Club of Launceston came into 
		being and charter 1803 was granted in August of that year by Rotary 
		International.<br><br>Launceston had the honour of being the first 
		Rotary club in Tasmania and at the inaugural meeting a telegram was 
		received from Sir Henry Jones (the first president of the Rotary Club of 
		Hobart), “forgiving Launceston for robbing Hobart of its birthright”.<br>
		<br>The club started with 25 members, men accustomed to lead, not 
		follow, to make their own decisions, to raise their own banner. For them 
		their Rotary emblem must be unique, different and memorable. A special 
		meeting was called and the platypus was unanimously adopted as the 
		centrepiece of the Rotary emblem for the Rotary Club of Launceston.<br>
		<br>It was enthusiastically displayed and printed at every opportunity 
		and when the Club’s first president Dr. John Ramsay became Past 
		President for the second time, having served two terms 1924/25 and again 
		in 1926/27, his wife, to mark the occasion presented a Past Presidents 
		jewel and ribbon incorporating the platypus emblem. The jewel 
		disappeared for some time and in 1931 a second such jewel was presented 
		to the outgoing President at that time, Charles F Monds.<br><br>Rotary 
		International for some time wrestled with the problem of how to deal 
		with an “improper” Rotary emblem being used by a Rotary Club on a remote 
		island off the South Coast of Australia and the Rotary convention of 
		1932 issued a decree forbidding the “mutilation” of the official emblem.<br>
		<br>Fortunately, mail travelled slowly by steamer in those days and the 
		new Past Presidents jewel had been engraved and had begun circulating by 
		the time the word arrived. Almost half a century later the original 
		platypus surfaced again, about the time the affairs of Lady Ramsay’s 
		estate were being wound up. The first Rotary Club of Tasmania therefore 
		has two unique and precious heirlooms, one of which must be chosen and 
		worn as their badge of office by each new Past President.<br><br>Sir 
		John Ramsay served twice as president, the only person to do so and was 
		one of the 30 founders of the Royal Australian College of Surgeons. He 
		was a Master of Surgery and Surgeon Superintendent of Launceston General 
		Hospital. In many diverse fields he was a born leader. When one of his 
		patients “died” on the operating table he plunged his hands into the 
		open chest cavity and performed the first heart massage which brought 
		the patient back to life. Although short in stature, Sir John Ramsay was 
		in every other sense of the term, a “big” man.<br><br>Membership grew to 
		34 by the end of the first year and the pattern for steady growth for 
		the Rotary Club of Launceston had commenced.<br><br>The year 1926/27 saw 
		Rotarian A C Ferrall and son Raymond attend the Pan-Pacific conference 
		and then proceed to Denver Colorado US for the RI convention In 1928 the 
		Rotary Club of Devonport was formed under the sponsorship of Launceston. 
		Since then the Club has been responsible for the formation of nine other 
		Rotary clubs and assisted in the establishment of several others.<br>
		<br>Early in 1929 Launceston was hit by the most disastrous floods in 
		its history and Rotary organised the collection and distribution of 
		clothing for people made homeless.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="/first100/presidents/rip-images/31-32pascall.jpg" style="float: left">It 
		was in the year 1931/32 that RI President
		<a href="/first100/presidents/1931pascall">
		Sydney W Pascall</a> visited the Club and p<a href="/first100/library/trees/pascall/index.htm">lanted 
		a tree of friendship</a> in Royal Park . Paul Harris also visited and 
		planted a similar tree in the
		<a href="/first100/library/trees/australia/index.htm">
		same park in 1935</a>.<br><br>With the great depression still hurting, 
		Rotary commenced a tradition of youth work with the Salvation Army, the 
		Children’s Hospital and Toc H. The second decade of Rotary was dominated 
		by relief work and help given to Red Cross and Red Shield. Clothing and 
		food parcels were sent to Britain during World War 11.<br><br>The Post- War decades saw youth work continued with youth 
		camps, a free kindergarten, establishment of recreational and picnic 
		areas and the positioning of a steam railway engine in a park to give 
		countless children a place to play.<br><br>The Bring Out A Britain 
		scheme was set up by Rotary in Tasmania in 1956/57 and by 1974 the Club 
		had assisted 144 people to settle in the State.<br><br>Many other 
		projects, too numerous to record here, have been undertaken since then 
		and continue to be carried out. The Club has produced five Rotary 
		District Governors and 10 Mayors of the City of Launceston .Many more 
		members have served as Aldermen and held other prominent positions 
		within the City in various avenues of service.<br><br>To serve with the 
		Rotary Club of Launceston is an experience of personal development 
		unable to be found elsewhere. The Club’s good works have multiplied as 
		today’s Rotarians continue to write their own pages into the Launceston 
		history.</td>
