				<span lang="it"><strong><span class="w">THE BIRTH OF ROTARY IN ITALY (years from 
				1923 to 1930)</span><br>
				<br>
				</strong>
				</span><span lang="en-gb">The Rotary movement in Italy began in Milan, in June 
				1923, when Mr. <a href="italy_details.htm#Henderson">James Henderson</a> and Mr. Leo Culleton, two 
				prominent British business men who had resided for years in this 
				country, gathered a small group of Italian business men to form 
				the nucleus of a Rotary Club.</span><p><span lang="en-gb">
				<a href="images/fondazione_milano.jpg" target="_blank">
				<img alt="Foundation of the R.C. Milano" src="images/tn_fondazione_milano.jpg" width="200" height="148" style="float: left" class="style15"></a>To the first group, which already included some 
				of the most 
				noted men in the city, other good elements were gradually added. 
				Regular weekly meetings were held and proper organization 
				secured, so that on December 20th, 1923, with the intervention 
				of special Commissioner F. W. Teele, the 
				<a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/global/countries/italy/index.htm" class="style4">
				<span class="style5"><strong>Rotary Club of Milan</strong></span></a> 
				was formally inaugurated, thus adding Italy's name to the 
				already long list of countries where Rotary existed.</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-gb">Milan was most fitted to understand Rotary and to bring its 
				message to the Nation. Its leading position in the financial, 
				industrial and commercial life of the country, its frequents 
				contacts with business circles abroad, the presence of a large 
				and influential class of progressive and public spirited 
				business men, made of this city the ideal ground for Rotary 
				experience.<br>
				Very soon the meetings of the Milan Club were the object of 
				interest and attention on the part of the press; the addresses 
				given to the Club by some of the nation's leading business men 
				were amply quoted, and a general interest was aroused in the 
				country for Rotary and for its programs. As an outcome of this 
				interest, small organizing groups were soon formed in other 
				important cities, an in a few months were ready to be officially 
				inaugurated. If 1923 had seen the inauguration of the one Club 
				of Milan, 1924 brought with it the inauguration of sever other 
				Clubs: Trieste, Genoa, Rome, Naples, Palermo and Venice. The 
				largest cities in Italy were thus given the privilege of having 
				a Rotary Club</span><span lang="it"> </span><span lang="en-gb">and the prominence of the men who accepted to 
				preside these new Clubs and the high standard of membership soon 
				secured Rotary a very high prestige in public opinion.<br>
				Also in 1924 the Rotary Club of Italy started the publication 
				of their monthly magazine: &quot;<a target="_blank" href="images/rivistaRotary.jpg">Il Rotary</a>&quot;.<br>
				<br>
				</span><span lang="it">
				<a href="images/federico&#32;guasti.jpg" target="_blank">
				<img alt="Federico Guasti" src="images/tn_federico&#32;guasti.jpg" width="158" height="200" style="float: left" class="style12"></a></span><span lang="en-gb">The following year, 1925, was a decisive one in the history of 
				Rotary in Italy. Not only the number of the Clubs was 
				substantially increased with the official inauguration of the 
				Clubs of Florence, Leghorn, Bergamo, Parma and Cuneo, but also 
				the Italian clubs were finally grouped in the new 46th. District, 
				Mr. J. Henderson being elected to the office of Governor.<br>
				</span><span lang="en-gb">The benefits arising from the creation of a District were 
				increased by the official recognition on the part of the Board 
				of Directors of Rotary International of the <em>
				<a href="italy_details.htm#THE_ITALIAN_NATIONAL_COUNCIL">Italian National 
				Council</a>, </em>whose composition, functions and privileges were 
				clearly defined and which became, with District Governor, the 
				leading force of the Rotary movement in Italy.</span><span lang="it"> 
				The District Treasurer was <strong>Federico Guasti</strong>, 
				from year 1926 until year 1938.</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-gb">Another important step was taken by the 
				National Council in organizing a permanent District Office in 
				Milan, and in electing a Secretary General to assist the 
				Governor in his work and also to coordinate the activities of 
				the Clubs. Rotarian Achille 
				Bossi of Milan, was elected to this office.</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-gb">President Everett Hill and Chesley Perry were given a vivid 
				evidence of the progress accomplished, when they attend the 
				first District Governor of the Italian Clubs held in Milan in 
				April 1925.</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-gb">A large number of delegates from the 10 Clubs already 
				inaugurated and from the others then in course of organization 
				took part in the Conference, which lasted two days and left a 
				deep impression on all who attended it. This conference elected 
				to the office of Governor for 1925-1926 Rotarian 
				<a href="../regions.html#Mylius&quot;&gt;">Giorgio Mylius</a> 
				whose able and active governorship was to give a further impulse 
				to extension work.</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-gb">In November 1925 the Italian Clubs </span><span lang="it">took 
				part </span><span lang="en-gb">with a large 
				delegation in the Meeting of the Executives of European 
				Continental Clubs which was held in Br<span lang="it">u</span>xelles. Among those who 
				attended, we may mention, besides <a href="italy_details.htm#Mylius">Giorgio Mylius</a> and Achille 
				Bossi, Felice Seghezza and Prince Piero Ginori Conti who later 
				were to became Governors of the 46th District.<br>
				<br>
				The following year was largely devoted to the proper 
				organization of the existing clubs. Only two new clubs were 
				inaugurated: those of Cremona and Piacenza; but the number of 
				Rotarians steadily increased, and the frequent intercourse 
				between the members of various clubs contributed materially to 
				develop that spirit of national fellowship which is a typical 
				feature of Rotary in Italy.</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-gb">The District Conference of 1926 was again held in Milan on April 
				21, 22, 23 and by its success far surpassed the previous one. 
				President Donald Adams and Past President Crawford Mac Cullough 
				were present, and had an opportunity to address a large number 
				of Rotarians who had come to Milan from all parts of Italy.</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-gb"><a href="italy_details.htm#Pirelli">Piero Pirelli</a> was elected by this Conference to succeed Giorgio Mylius, who closed his year 
				of splendid work for Rotary as 
				Governor, representing the 46th District at the Denver 
				Convention.</span></p>

				the Rotary Clubs of Italy.</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-gb">At the same time other events came to show how Rotary stood in 
				the country. H.R.H. the Duke of Aosta honoured Rotary by 
				accepting the honorary membership of the R.C. of Naples, and at 
				the banquet offered him by his Club made a notable speech 
				showing his appreciation of Rotary and of its contribution to 
				the progress of the nation. A few months later the two brothers 
				of the Duke entered Rotary, the Duke of the Abruzzi becoming an 
				honorary member of the R.C. Genoa, and the Count of Turin an 
				honorary member of the R.C. of Florence.</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-gb">In April 1927 the Crown Prince Umberto </span><span lang="it">
				of</span><span lang="en-gb"> Savoia most 
				graciously accepted the nomination as Honorary Member of the

				district he was born, and which for centuries was one of the 
				strongest bulwarks of the dynasty of Savoy.</span><span lang="it"><br>
				<br>
				The </span>District Conference for 1927 was held in Leghorn (Livorno), 
				in the early days of May, and the importance of its work and the 
				large attendance proved how great a progress Rotary had made 
				during the year.</p>
				<p>It was a privilege for European Rotarians to have the 
				<a target="_self" href="../../presidents/conventions/1927/index.htm" class="style4">
				<strong>1927 
				Rotary Convention in Ostend</strong></a>. The Italian Clubs took full 
				advantage of this opportunity. The<span lang="it">y</span> were all represented, and the 
				Italian delegation amounted to 61 members.</p>
				<p>
				<img alt="Felice Seghezza" src="images/tn_felice&#32;seghezza.jpg" width="129" height="200" style="float: left" class="style13"><strong>Director Seghezza</strong> had no sooner returned from an extensive trip 
				visiting Rotary Clubs in America, when&nbsp; he was informed of 
				his election to the office of Governor of the 46th District for 
				1927-1928. After having presided for two years the R.C. of 
				Genoa, and after one year intensive work as Director, Seghezza 
				was surely entitled to some rest, and only his deep sense of 
				duty could induce him to accept the nomination.&nbsp;</p>
				<p><span lang="it">On </span>September 6th 1927 the Crown Prince was 
				officially received at the R.C. of Cuneo, Governor Seghezza and 
				Immediate Past Governor Pirelli being present together with the 
				Presidents of all the Italian Clubs. A few days later, on 
				September 19th the Executives Meeting of the Italian District 
				was held in Como, under the presidency of President Sapp and 
				with the intervention of Chesley Perry and Past President Frank 
				Mulholland. The luncheon was honored by the presence of the 
				Crown Prince who spent most of the time in lively conversation 
				with President Sapp.</p>
				<p>After the Como meeting, President Sapp and Chesley Perry went to 
				Milan and then to Rome, where, together with Governor Seghezza, 
				they were received in private audience by Mr. Mussolini. The official communication issued to the press by the Premier's 
				Press Bureau contained the following interesting statement: <em>
				&quot;The Head of the Government very much appreciated the greetings 
				addressed to him, and showing himself well acquainted with the 
				object Rotary pursues by creating friendly intercourse and 
				cooperation between the most prominent representatives of the 
				various business and intellectual activities of the world, 
				expressed his cordial satisfaction, reciprocating with his 
				sentiments of good will&quot;.<span lang="it"><br>
				<br>
				</span></em>
				<span lang="it">On </span>New Year's day 1928, Governator 
				Seghezza announced in his message to the Italian Clubs that H.M. 
				the King had deigned to accept honorary membership of the Club 
				of Rome and to become Honorary Governor of the Italian District. 
				This had been the greatest desire of Italian Rotarians, and the 
				event was celebrated with enthusiastic manifestations in all of 
				the Clubs.<br>
				The strong personality of the King, and his prominent influence 
				in the history and progress of Italy are so well known that we 
				hardly need to point out the value of such an high recognition. 
				Few men in this time embody the Rotary ideals as Victor Emmanuel 
				the Third. </p>
				<p>On January&nbsp; 17th 1928 the King received in private audience 
				Governor Felice Seghezza, Achille Bossi (Secretary General) and 
				the officers of the Rome Rotary Club who expressed to H.M. the 
				gratitude and appreciation of all Rotarians.</p>
				<p>Extension work was actively resumed in the early months of the 
				year. The Club of Messina was officially inaugurated, and the 
				organization of other Clubs properly started. </p>
				<p>The fourth District's Conference was held in Turin in May, and 
				by its success far surpassed all the former ones.<br>
				The Conference was inaugurated by H.R.H. the Crown Prince at the 
				presence of H.R.H. the Prince of Udine (also a Rotarian) and of 
				all the civil and military authorities. The Prince was visibly 
				pleased with the words of greetings addressed to him by Governor 
				Seghezza and by Stanley Leverton on behalf of Rotary 
				International, and followed with great interest an address given 
				by a prominent writer, Rotarian Ugo Ojetti, on &quot;Art, Science and 
				Rotary&quot;.</p>
				<p>The second meeting was presided by the Duke of Aosta. Some of 
				Italy's leading men in business, literature and arts addressed 
				the Conference, both on subjects of national interest and on 
				subject strictly relating to Rotary, and the press gave very 
				diffused accounts of the proceedings.</p>
				<p>In June 1928 the Italian clubs attended the 
				<a href="../../presidents/conventions/1928/index.htm" class="style4">
				<strong>Minneapolis

				Commissioner for the Province of Naples. The Conference 
				discussed several matters of strictly Rotarian character, and a 
				group of competent speakers dealt with the demographic problem, 
				which is one of the<span lang="it">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>subjects
				&nbsp;on which public opinion is most interested in Italy. But 
				the most important action of the Conference was the voting of a 
				resolution intended to state the position of Rotary with 
				reference to a Rotarian's relation to his country. The 
				resolution was shortly afterwards submitted by the Italian clubs 
				to the
				<a href="../../presidents/conventions/1929/index.htm" class="style4">
				<strong>Convention of Dallas</strong></a>, where it was finally adopted. As 
				this resolution clearly reflects the attitude of the Italian 
				Rotarians on some fundamental aspects of Rotary. Here's its

				<br>
				</strong>The Board of Directors of Rotary International, 
				approved in 1925 the creation of a National Council, to assist 
				the Governor of the 46th District in the administration of 
				Rotary in Italy. The Council was composed of delegates from the 
				various Clubs of the District, each Club having the right to 
				appoint one delegate for every 25 members or major fraction. <br>
				The Council is essentially a consultative body, and its 
				resolutions may be carried out only through the Governor and 
				with the consent of the Governor who can also <em>veto</em> any 
				resolution not consistent with the Constitution and By Laws of 
				Rotary International.<br>

				National Council has proved very useful in creating frequent and 
				close contacts between the leading men of the different Clubs, 
				in unifying ideas and pratical policies, in enabling the 
				Governor to keep in touch with the tendencies and opinions of 
				the various Clubs of Italy into a definite body with a national 
				field of action and a national character.<br>
				The Council met three time every year: in spring, fall and 
				winter and its members were elected every year by the various 
				Clubs. The General Secretary , the Assistant General Secretary 
				and the Treasurer of the District (it was 46th), were elected 
				every year by the National Council its self. The picture 
				represent a meeting of the National Council in 1927, Park Hotel
