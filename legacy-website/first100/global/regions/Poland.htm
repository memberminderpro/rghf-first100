				19 1931. Other clubs followed at regular intervals, the nine 
				pre-war clubs being:-<br>
				<br>

				Bydgoszcz on December 30 1935<br>
				Pabianice on August 22 1938<br>
				<br>
				As happened elsewhere, some clubs experienced opposition from 
				the Roman Catholic church. The Bydgoszcz Club in particular 
				recorded that the Church had effectively prevented the creation 
				of a Rotary club in Poznan and elsewhere. It seems that the 
				Church believed that Rotary was a form of Freemasonry, an 
				organisation which it felt was in opposition to the teaching and 
				practices of the Church. While it was true that many Rotarians 
				were masons and vice versa, the two movements were always quite 
				separate.<br>
				<br>
				When the Germans invaded Poland in September 1939, Rotary, as it 
				did in other parts of Occupied Europe, came to a standstill and 
				on October 10, 1940 all the clubs had their charters terminated. 
				When the Germans were driven out, Rotary fared no better under 
				the Communists. One Polish Rotarian, Casimir Zienkiewicz of the 
				Katowice Club, escaped to London and there helped to start the

				<br>

				<p><br>
				When Rotary was originally established in Poland in 1931, it was 
				reported that it was an inspiring event in Poland, our beloved 
				country, restored in 1918, following the Great War, to new 
				independent life. This came after 125 years of Russian control 
				in a country which was one of the first in history to have a 
				liberal system of government. Therefore, at the proper moment, 
				the great Rotarian movement was able to find unselfish followers 
				in Poland .The principle of 'Service Above Self' was ever close 
				to the Polish spirit.<br>
				<br>
				In 1989, it was reported that. &quot;there is again a favourable 
				atmosphere in Poland ..to come back to the ideals of service, 
				fellowship, goodwill and peace&quot;. In this context the possibility 
				of re-establishing Rotary was just one more evidence of a 
				dramatic change and of progress towards an open, democratic 
				society. The achievement of world peace and understanding is one 
				of the major goals of Rotary. Coincidentally this goal was also 
				undertaken in June 1984, when, under the auspices of the 
				Australian Institute of International Affairs, my wife and I 
				participated in a study tour of four communist countries in 
				Eastern Europe including Poland.<br>
				<br>
				As it turned out, when returning by train from Crackow to 
				Warsaw, I met for the first time Marek Sredniawa, a young 
				academic from the Warsaw Institute of Technology . During the 
				course of our conversation, Marek spoke of his professional aims 
				for the future and the difficulties and lack of opportunity. of 
				gaining world experience by visiting other countries. We 
				exchanged business cards and although I said nothing to him at 
				the time, his enthusiasm to help his country and his keenness to 
				improve his knowledge, struck a chord with me . On my return 
				home, I had the opportunity at my Rotary club of giving a three 
				minute talk on my visit overseas and finished up by saying 
				&quot;wouldn't it be wonderful if we could wave a magic wand and 
				bring this young man to Australia so that he can attend the 
				International Telecommunications Conference in Sydney&quot;. It is 
				now a matter of record that with the help of the Rotary network 
				in Canberra and Sydney, Marek's dream came true. He attended the 
				International Telecommunications Conference and, before 
				returning home, was introduced and enjoyed his first experience 
				of Rotary service and fellowship.<br>
				<br>
				This could have been the end of the story. Fortunately, however, 
				the spirit of Rotary service and its benefical effect within a 
				community was not lost on Marek. His astute mind quickly picked 
				up the idea and value of such an organization.<br>
				<br>
				Following the success of this visit, I maintained contact with 
				Marek in the hope of extending the hand of friendship to other 
				young academics from behind the Iron Curtain and during my 
				visits to Evanston as a member of the Rotary International 
				Finance Committee, actively pursued the idea of similar projects 
				for young people similarly placed .<br>
				<br>
				It was on one of my final visits to Evanston about 1987, 
				however, I learned that the Trustees of the Rotary Foundation 
				had appointed me to be leader of the first Group Study Exchange 
				program to be undertaken in a communist country, namely to 
				Poland. I immediately contacted Marek to arrange the GSE program 
				and in April 1988 visited Poland to discuss details of the 
				exchange. It was also an occasion to have some informal meetings 
				with the medium level representatives of Polish authorities to 
				discuss prospects of such visits by Rotary, for without state 
				approval no such international meetings would be possible.<br>
				<br>
				At that time Marek also recruited a group of six men of 
				different professions as a host team for the first leg of the 
				GSE visit to Australia . This team, incidentally, ultimately 
				became the nucleus of the future Warsaw club. The successful 
				result of talks gave us the stimulus to arrange a meeting at 
				senior government level and directly discuss the possibility of 
				reestablishing Rotary in Poland.<br>
				<br>
				Fortunately, at this time Michael Gorbachov's 'Glasnost' and 'Perestroka' 
				had begun to influence the thinking of people in Eastern Europe 
				.This was not only the watershed of communism but also the 
				turning point for the development of Rotary in Eastern Europe. 
				It was during this preparatory stage of the development of the 
				GSE program that I became increasingly aware of a genuine 
				interest by the Polish hierarchy in Rotary. Of course this was 
				not always straight sailing as evidenced by some of the 
				questions posed to me including &quot; What is this capitalist 
				organization all about?&quot; and &quot;What is meant by Rotary's motto 
				'He Profits most who Serves Best'&quot;?<br>
				<br>
				On my return home and being aware of Rotary's policy that no 
				steps could be undertaken for international extension without 
				approval from the Board of Rotary International. I immediately 
				contacted Royce Abbey who was soon to take up the appointment of 
				President of Rotary International. I told Royce of my experience 
				in Poland and of what I believed was the positive reception of 
				the idea of the re-establishment of Rotary. I also suggested 
				that I would be prepared to arrange a visit for him to meet the 
				appropriate authorities. Royce immediately agreed and during 
				July 1988, together with the General Secretary of R.I. Phillip 
				Lindsay, I returned to Warsaw where we were able to finalise not 
				only the GSE program, but to put in train the initial steps for 
				re-establishing the Rotary Club of Warsaw.<br>
				<br>
				In the words of Marek Sredniawa, &quot;In September 1988 we hosted a 
				GSE team from District 971 (now 9710), led by Jack Olsson. The 
				reciprocal visit of the Polish team to Australia took place in 
				February 1989.The GSE program was really successful and helped 
				very much in founding our club&quot;.<br>
				<br>
				Rotary International appointed the Rotary Club of Malmo Sweden 
				as the sponsoring club, and Past R.I President Ernst Brietholtz 
				to represent R.I. President Royce Abbey in presenting the 
				charter to the re-established Rotary Club of Warsaw.</p>
				<p>On November 9 1989 at the Royal Castle Warsaw, my wife and I 
				had the honour, together with 500 distinguished guests and 
				Rotarians from around the world, of being present on that most 
				historical occasion</p>
