		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">Is a Member State of the European 
		Union since 2004, with a population of about 1 million. It is an island 
		located at the Eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea, between 3 
		continents (Europe, Asia and Africa) and its history goes back to 10.000 
		years BC. Cyprus is part of Rotary International District 2452 and today 
		is a home of 19 Rotary Clubs.<br><br>The first Rotary Club was 
		established in 1938 in Nicosia, the RC of Nicosia, at the initiative of 
		a small group of distinguished Cypriot businessmen and professionals who 
		had seen Rotary work abroad. The group included Costas Manglis, Zenon 
		Pierides, Theodoros Artemis. Sir Mehmet Mounir, Stelios Georgallides, 
		George Poulias and others. The club charter was presented to the club by 
		the then Governor Arthur Merton and the first President was Rot. N. E. 
		Disney who continued to be President for the first 3 consecutive years.
		<br><br>Possibly because of the World War of 1940-45, there was a big 
		time-gap between the establishment of the first RC in Cyprus and the 
		second, which was the RC of Limassol established in 1951, followed by 
		the RC of Larnaca organised in 1953 by the then Rotarian Mayor of 
		Larnaca Zenon Pierides who had been one of the founder members of the 
		Nicosia club and who later served as District Governor (1956-1957) and 
		then Director of RI during the years 1963-1965. About the same timework 
		was started on the establishment of the RC of Famagusta, which received 
		its charter in 1954.<br><br>In 1957 Cyprus became part of District 195, 
		which included Egypt, Lebanon and certain other Countries of the Middle 
		East.<br><br>There followed another pause of 15 years and in 1969 Paphos 
		acquired its own Rotary Club, the RC of Paphos followed next year, in 
		1970, by Kyrenia, the RC of Kyrenia.<br><br>By Special Permission of 
		Rotary International the RC of Famagusta and the RC of Kyrenia extended 
		their territories to Limassol and Nicosia respectively since they have 
		lost their own Territories as a result of the Turkish invasion of 1974.<br>
		<br>In 1977 District 195 was called District 245.<br><br>After a lull 
		until 1982, started another round of 4 Rotary Clubs, making all 10 until 
		1991: Nicosia-Ledra (1982), Limassol-Amathusia (1985), Nicosia-Lefkothea 
		(1987), Larnaca-Kition (1991).<br><br>In 1991 our District 245 was 
		called District 2450. Another 5 Clubs were established, making all 15 
		until the end of the 20th century: Famagusta-Cavo Greco (1992), 
		Nicosia-Aspelia (1995), Nicosia-Salamis (1996) [which was formed with a 
		prime purpose to offer the opportunity mainly to refugees from Famagusta 
		living in Nicosia to serve through Rotary, since the RC of Famagusta was 
		based in Limassol], Limassol-Kourion (1997) and Paphos-Aphrodite (1997).<br>
		<br>In 2001 Limassol-Berengaria Cosmopolitan was chartered and then the 
		3 Turkish Cypriot Clubs followed: Nicosia-Sarayönü (2004), Kyrenia-Liman 
		(2004) and Kyrenia-St. Hilarion (2007), making all 19 Rotary Clubs of 
		Cyprus with a total membership of over 800 Rotarians, of whom a fair 
		number are women.<br><br>(For details of each Club 
		visit:www.rotary-cyprus.org).<br><br>By 2012-2013, the Members of 
		District 2450 were: Egypt, Cyprus, Lebanon, Jordan, Bahrain, United Arab 
		Emirates, Armenia, Georgia, Sudan and Palestine. <br><br>Cyprus through 
		75 years of Rotary History has given the District 11 Governors: Costas 
		Manglis (1952-1953), Zenon Pierides (1956-1957), Nicos Dimitriou 
		(1962-1963), Mikis Agrotis (1967-1968), Michael Theodossiou (1972-1973), 
		Phoebus Zachariades (1976-1977), Leandros Zachariades (1982-1983), 
		Christodoulos Karakannas (1990-1991), Doros Jeropoulos (1998-1999), John 
		Strongylos (2005-2006) and Kevork Mahdessian (2012-2013)the last DG of 
		District 2450).<br><br>The last 77th District 2450 Conference took place 
		in Limassol, Cyprus, 4-7 April 2013 as “The Last of the Best”. 951 
		members from all countries of the District participated. It was really a 
		unique success and the best closing of District 2450.<br><br>In Rotary 
		year 2013-2014, District 2450 split in 2 Districts:<br><br>(a) District 
		2451: Egypt only with 73 Clubs and<br>(b) District 2452: Cyprus (19 
		Clubs), Lebanon (24), Jordan (10), Bahrain (3), United Arab Emirates 
		(3), Armenia (4), Georgia (2), Sudan (1), and Palestine (1). <br><br>
		From time to time the RCs of Cyprus held joint meetings at which they 
		discuss matters of common interest under the guidance of a Coordinating 
		Committee, which includes the Past District Governors, the Deputy 
		District Governors, the Assistant Governors and all Club Presidents of 
		the year.<br><br>All the RCs of Cyprus are functioning quite well, 
		carrying out useful projects and rendering good service to their 
		communities. Examples of projects include an Old Age Hostel established 
		in Limassol, a Deaf School established in Nicosia, a Forest of 
		Friendship in Larnaca, Blood Banks, a Cord Blood Registry in Nicosia (as 
		a Centennial Project by Rotary Clubs of Cyprus), Alzheimer Day Care 
		Centers, Nursery Gardens, Libraries, Scholarships and many other smaller 
		projects. They also promoted various Island Campaigns, including a Road 
		Safety Campaign (the RC of Nicosia-Salamis being the first Rotary Club 
		to have signed the European Safety Charter), a Save our Forests 
		Campaign, a Preserve Planet Earth Campaign, a Donation of Human Tissue 
		Campaign.<br><br>In January 2014 under the stewardship of RC 
		Nicosia-Lefkothea a “Polio Fund-raiser” was organized by all Cyprus 
		Rotary clubs. The event was held at the Presidential Palace under the 
		auspices of the President of the Republic and was participated by 300 
		Rotarians and friends raising the total amount of €6.000 in favour of RI 
		Polio Project.<br><br>Cyprus Rotary Clubs are most frequently supported 
		in their Projects by their partners in Service, their sponsored Rotaract 
		Clubs and Interact Clubs frequented by the vibrant nest generation of 
		youth and hopefully Rotarians.<br><br>Inner Wheel Clubs are widely 
		popular in Cyprus awarding Rotarians’ wives the opportunity for service.<br>
		<br>Individually each Rotary club has to its credit a wealth of projects 
		carried out in its community and internationally.<br><br>Evidently 
		Rotary's ideal of Service to our fellow human beings seems to find a 
		warm place in the hearts of Cypriots who are by nature friendly and 
		hospitable people, and feel happy offering help and service to our 
		fellow human beings.<br><br>Regarding RGHF (Rotary Global History 
		Fellowship), Cyprus and Cyprus Rotary as a whole have achieved up to 
		2013 3 First World Records: (a) The First RGHF Country Association in 
		the World (2011-2012), (b) The first in the World RGHF Cyprus pin for 
		the 121 RGHF Cyprus members (2013), as well as for the new members to 
		join, (c) RC Nicosia-Lefkothea, the First 100% RGHF Rotary Club in the 
		World, with 72 members joining (2009).</td>
