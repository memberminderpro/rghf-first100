					<p><font size="4">The tiny republic of Moldova was once 
					known as BESSARABIA when in 1918 after the grand border 
					reshuffle, giving effect to a plebescite , it was obtained 
					by Rumania as an attachment to Rumanias Moldova Province .
					</font></p>
					<p><font size="4">In 1940 following the Molotov von 
					Ribbebtrop pact it was again annexed to Russia (more 
					literally the Ukraine ).</font></p>
					<p><font size="4">On the break up of the Soviet Union 
					,Moldova sought and obtained independence . This was the 
					smallest of the Soviet Republics (13,000 Sq Miles) which 
					lies immediately East of Moldova province of Rumania, east 
					of the Prut River and west of the Dniester River which 
					seperates Moldavia from the Ukraine. Its capital is CHISINAU 
					formerly known as Kishinev . The population though mixed 
					comprises a majority of Rumanian speaking Walachians (Vlachs). 
					There are at least 900,000 Russian speaking Russians and 
					Ukrainians in the population of 3,500,000 </font></p>
					<p><font size="4">Until 1998 there had not been Rotary 
					involvement in Moldova ,but of course there had been active 
					Rotary Clubs operating prior to World War 2 in the Kingdom 
					of Rumania of which it was then part. Specifically the Iasi 
					Rotary club of Rumania some 120 km away was then its closest 
					club . </font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font size="4">ROTARY CLUB OF CHISINAU (chartered 20 May 
				1998)</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font size="4">The Homepages of the Derbty South Rotary 
					Club D1220 of England tell us the story of how the Chisinau 
					Rotary club came into being .</font>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><font size="4">A brief synopsis of this as shown on the 
					email section of Rotarians on the Internet ROTI on 7 April 
					1999 is reprinted below .</font></p>
					<p><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><i>Dear fellows ,</i></font></p>
					<p><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><i>I have just read a most 
					wonderful story of initiative, compassion and enterprise all 
					at the hands of the Derby South Rotary Club of England D 
					1220. The club celebrated its 25th anniversary last year and 
					leading up to that it wanted to do something really special 
					. Now I note from its membership list that it has some 
					Rotarians clearly from foreign extraction, which probably 
					did help ...In Dec 1996 club members became aware of the 
					terrible plight of orphans in orphanages in Russia and in 
					former Russian states . In this case the children were in 
					the tiny former Soviet Republic of Moldova . Now this tiny 
					country was once known as Bessarabia and was gained by 
					Rumania as part of its Moldova province from the Russians in 
					1918 . They lost it again in 1940 when &quot;uncle Joe Stalin 
					&quot;annexed it together with the northern tip of Bukovina . </i>
					</font></p>
					<p><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><i>In 1990, when the 
					Soviet Union collapsed, this tiny state sought independence 
					.Firmly wedged between Rumania and the Ukraine, its future 
					does not seem awfully better than that of Russia.</i></font></p>
					<p><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><i>Anyway the Derby South 
					Club heard about the fate of some 600 children without 
					proper food ,without hygiene, blankets, hot water bottles, 
					warm clothes in a country where it is pretty cold over 
					Christmas. (-5 degrees and zero heating ) . In 10 days 
					Rotary had its community into gear. It got 2 strong vehicles 
					with 2 up built trailers and loaded same with milk powder, 
					food provisions, blankets, hot water bottles, medical 
					supplies, aquaboxes, baby feeding bottles etc etc and sent a 
					team of Rotarians there to drive the return journey of some 
					6,300 km through Belgium France Austria Germany Hungary and 
					through Rumania to their destination in Chisinau, capital of 
					Moldova. 7 days later they were back in Derby . The 
					children, huddled two to a cot sharing an old army blanket 
					between them on worn out and unhygienic mattresses ,which 
					ought to have been condemned years ago, the children made a 
					heart wrenching sight .Frequent power cuts left them in the 
					dark for hours on end ,appalling sanitation, dirty and 
					unhygienic toilet and washing facilities and minimal medical 
					care ,these children were the children which the world 
					seemed to have forgotten about ... </i></font></p>
					<p><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><i>So what could this 
					single Derby Rotary club do about this ?? Well they thought 
					that Rotary could make a difference . They intended to 
					repeat their labour of love and next time come with money 
					,but who would oversee this so far away ?...The nearest 
					Rotary club was the relatively new Iasi Rotary club just on 
					the border of Rumania with the Moldova Republic ..These too 
					were brand new Rotarians in a country like Moldova not long 
					truly independent .So the Derby boys thought why not aim at 
					the top and start Rotary in Moldova if for no other reason 
					than to administer our project with the orphanages there… 
					Spade work was done .RI was approached and the English DG 
					gave the move every bit of support...</i></font></p>
					<p><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><i>In November 1997, the 
					Club had raised locally with Rotaracters and the local High 
					schools help some 6000 Pounds Sterling($US9000 ) and it set 
					off again to Moldova .. On 20 May 1998 the Rotary club of 
					Chisinau ,the first Rotary club in the Republic of Moldova 
					received its charter ... And all that because a truly 
					courageous and enterprising British Rotary club set out to 
					prove that indeed Rotary can make a difference ! Well Basil 
					put out your chest...This one is really worth crowing about 
					!!! </i></font></p>
					<p><font color="#0000ff" size="4"><i>Henk of Kumeu NZ </i>
					</font></p>
					<p>&nbsp;<font size="4">It is obvious from this item that the 
					CHISINAU ROTARY CLUB in receiving its charter was 
					immediately charged with &quot;keeping an eye on the childrens' 
					homes&quot; ,which the Derby South Club sought out for a special 
					treat in 1996 and 1997.</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font size="4">NEW ZEALAND ROTARY INVOLVEMENT ROTARY CLUB OF 
				BULLS D 9940</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font size="4">Rotary Down Under in its March 1999 
					edition reported on the activities of the small rural NZ 
					Rotary Club of Bulls, which is situated at the bottom of the 
					North Island of New Zealand . Through P P Lyndon Tamblyn's 
					business activities in Moldova ,the club became aware of the 
					atrocious conditions in that country's orphanages . Lyndon 
					returned to New Zealand and told members of his club of the 
					great poverty in Moldova ,where the average monthly income 
					was $US 30 per month and the unemployment benefit runs at 
					$US 1 per month . There was tremendous unemployment reported 
					Lyndon .As the English members of the Derby South Rotary 
					club had also found ,the children were underfed and 
					underclothed in that country with very cold winters and cold 
					orphanages with temperatures of -20 degrees C . The Bulls 
					Rotary Club created WARM (Woollen Apparel Required for 
					Moldova ). The whole district 9940 came to help ,businessmen 
					and schools joined in ,the women knitted toy teddy bears and 
					other knitted toys ,and the club pressed 7000 kilos of 
					woollen clothing into wool bales ,a function with which the 
					locals would be very familiar in this heart of NZ farming 
					country ,and filled up an entire container ..</font>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><font size="4">In October 1998 13 Rotarians ,partners and 
					friends led by PP Lyndon and wife Birgit left NZ for Moldova 
					to receive and distribute their container load….</font>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><font size="4">The goods had been shipped to the port of 
					Constanza in Rumania ,the nearest port ……..and surprise 
					surprise …The Rumanians required duty to be paid of $US 40 
					cents per kg …a cool $US 2600… </font></p>
					<p><font size="4">Here the locals proved invaluable Two 
					persuasive Businessman members of the new Chisinau Rotary 
					Club traveled to Rumania with a truck to collect the goods 
					and struck a deal with the Rumanians . The Kiwis never 
					learned what the deal was ,but there was a lot of cheer on 
					the way back …</font>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><font size="4">The Chisinauans had prepared a 
					distribution plan and the team provided goodies to 70 
					orphanages .. Poor families as well as orphanages profited 
					..There were smiles on the kiddies faces and in one village 
					,the school had prepared pictures for the visitors ,made 
					music and sang for them and the village put on the lunch, 
					for poverty does not remove local pride . The local winery 
					put on the wine . </font></p>
					<p><font size="4">It was so satisfying to do this said PP 
					Lyndon …We are working already on the next container which 
					is scheduled to leave NZ for Moldova next September 1999.</font>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><font size="4">As for the Chisinau Rotarians ? It makes 
					us feel good to be able to do our part In helping to address 
					the colossal need in our country ..Besides we are making 
					many new good friends !!! </font></p>
