<br>1891-1896 Paul Harris, who was raised by his New England grandparents with 
values of tolerance toward all, gained his law degree in 1891. 1In his senior 
year, a former graduate told his class that they should &quot;Go to a small town for 
five years make a fool of themselves, then go to the big city!&quot; Paul decided to 
hit
<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1910harris/paulharris/restless/">the road for the entire world</a>. He worked as a reporter for the San Francisco 
Chronicle, 1891; manual laborer on a fruit ranch, then raisin packing plant, 
teacher at the L.A. Business College in 1892. Denver, Colorado, 1892: Actor in a 
stock company, reporter for the Rocky Mountain News, cowboy, reporter for The 
Republican. Jacksonville, Florida: St. James Hotel night clerk, traveling 
granite/marble salesman 1892/93, reporter on the Washington Star, cattleman on a 
ship 1893, haymaker and cannery worker 1893, sub-foreman of the gang of 
cattlemen 1893, (where he wrote that, on his first voyage, he experienced 
sub-human conditions); orange picker in Florida 1893, back to Jacksonville 
selling marble granite. His territory included the southern states, Cuba, the 
Bahamas and Europe. When he announced that he was going to Chicago to practice 
law his employer said, &quot;Whatever the advantages of settling in Chicago may be, I 
am satisfied you will make more money if you remain with me.&quot; To which Paul 
replied: &quot;I am sure you are right but I am not going to Chicago for the purpose 
of making money; I am going for the purpose of living a life.&quot; </p>

<p>
<br>1896-1905 
In 1896, he did go to Chicago to practice law. One evening, in 1900, Paul went 
with a professional friend to his suburban home. After dinner, as they strolled 
through the neighborhood, Paul's friend introduced him to tradesmen in their 
stores. This reminded Paul of his grandparent's home in New England. &quot;Why not 
have a fellowship composed of businessmen from different occupations, without 
restrictions of politics or religion?&quot; he thought.<br><br>1905-1908 2On February 
23, 1905, Paul Harris had dinner with his closest friend, Chicago coal dealer 
<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/schiele/index.htm">Silvester Schiele.</a> Afterwards they walked over the river to 
<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/index.php/and-more-histories/the-room-711">Room 711</a> of the 
Unity Building where they met their host, Gustavus Loehr, a mining engineer; and 
another friend, Hiram Shorey, a merchant tailor. Harris proposed that they form 
a club. No name was chosen for the group. The second meeting was March 9th. 
Three other men, Harry Ruggles, William Jenson, and A. L. White joined them. 
Ruggles was a printer, and created the &quot;name badge&quot; version of the Rotary &quot;wheel&quot; and also started singing in Rotary. In fact his singing kept the group 
from disbanding more than once. Paul Harris later wrote: &quot;The significant 
occurrence of the second meeting was the introduction of 
<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/ruggles/index.htm">Harry Ruggles</a>, the 
printer. Harry was destined to play an important part in the life of the Chicago 
club, for through his suggestion of club singing his influence has been made 
felt by the entire movement.&quot; Paul P. Harris, page 95 &quot;The Founder of Rotary 
1928. Two weeks later the group gathered at the office of Silvester Schiele, in 
his coal yard at Twelfth and State Streets. Six of the previous seven were 
present along with Charles Newton and Arthur B. Irwin.<br><br>1908-1910 1Paul 
was very interested in starting Rotary in other cities. The second Rotary club 
was founded by <a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/wood/">Homer Wood</a> in 
<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/cities/clubs/02sanfrancisco.htm">San Francisco in 1908.</a> 7Wood then quickly organized 
<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/cities/clubs/03oakland.htm">Oakland #3</a> (When did weekly meetings begin? 6According to the general secretary 
in 1948, it was Oakland #3 in 1909.) 
<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/cities/clubs/04seattle.htm">Seattle #4</a> and 
<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/cities/clubs/05losangeles.htm">Los Angeles #5</a>. In fact, 
before the end of 1909, there were seven clubs, including New York City #6 and 
Boston #7. That's right, in 1908 and 1909, Homer Wood started four clubs. In the 
rest of the United States there were two, and the San Francisco club is 
credited, by some, with starting New York.<br><br>GROWTH OF ROTARY AROUND THE 
WORLD Paul Harris had a vision of &quot;Around the World Rotary&quot; which was also 
opposed by many of his fellow Rotarians. It was not until he won the loyalty of 
the man who was to be Rotary's secretary from 1910 – 1942 that Rotary became 
organized and international. That man was Chesley Perry, whom Paul called the 
&quot;Builder of Rotary.&quot;<br><br>From www.onepagehistory.info by RGHF senior
