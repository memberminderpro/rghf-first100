		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Georgia">Such was the praise of an organization that had a humble beginning on 
		February 23, 1905. But &quot;even the world's mighty rivers have humble 
		beginnings&quot;, he adds. &quot;They start as tiny springs. As the rivulet 
		trickles down, it brings new life to everything it touches. Soon other 
		tiny streams join its path and together they unite as a river, ever more 
		confident and forceful&quot;. <br><br>Rotary too started as a trickle by a lonely lawyer named Paul P Harris. 
		On that chilly and windy wintry evening he and three of his friends 
		decided to form a club where they could meet and deal with one another 
		in friendship and trust. It was the stream that started a mighty river. 
		Today more than 1.2 million Rotarians are committed to the ideal of 
		service in about 33,000 clubs in more that 166 countries and 
		geographical territories around the globe.<br><br>Rotary came to Asia in 1919 with the establishment of the Rotary club of 
		Manila in the Philippines. Rotary Club of Calcutta was chartered during 
		the following Rotary year. Thus the global organization was introduced 
		to the subcontinent. Under the auspices of Calcutta Rotary club, elites 
		of <b>Dhaka</b> organized themselves on December 22, 1937 to form the <u><b>first Rotary club in Bangladesh</b></u>. It secured its charter on 
		February 26, 1938. It took fourteen years before the second club could 
		be organized in Chittagong on September 26, 1952. The real take off of 
		Rotary started after Bangladesh became a sovereign nation. Starting with 
		only seven clubs in 1971, there are now 132 Rotary clubs in Bangladesh 
		with a membership of almost 4,000 Rotarians. <br><br>Rotary's role is that of a Pathfinder. One can see passenger-sheds in 
		most bus stands in every city and town. Rotary built the first one in 
		front of the national press club, Dhaka, in the early fifties. Others 
		then followed. Such pioneering stories were repeated in cases of 
		'manually operated shallow tube well for irrigation', tree plantation 
		and similar other projects. <br><br>PolioPlus initiative has been Rotary's finest hour. It has given us a 
		lot to be proud of, and as Rotarians, we have all played a big part in 
		our successes. In Bangladesh, Rotarians gave millions of volunteer hours 
		in immunizing the children on all NID's. The country received about taka 
		1250 million in the form of polio vaccines and other logistics support 
		from The Rotary Foundation of RI. Thanks to the combined efforts of the 
		government, WHO, UNICEF, CDC and Rotary, Bangladesh has been polio free 
		since the year 2000. Dolly was the last detected case that year and our 
		promise is to halt the number there. <br><br>Perhaps the most successful service projects that have lasting and 
		beneficial impacts in the life and economy of Bangladesh were the Inland 
		Fisheries and the Integrated Farming Projects undertaken by Rotary Club 
		of Comilla. Under the leadership of Past District Governor late M Azizul 
		Huq (former minister), the club launched the first project in 1984. With 
		financial assistance of The Rotary foundation, 250 fish fry nurseries 
		and 53 fish fry hatcheries were established in Brahmanbaria, Chandpur, 
		Chittagong, Comilla, Feni, Noakhali and Habiganj districts. The second 
		project again with financial assistance from The Rotary Foundation 
		sought to add horticulture, silviculture, livestock and poultry as added 
		components of the fish fry project. Today this model of integrated 
		fishing and farming can be seen around the country, thanks to the 
		Comilla initiative which served as the nucleus. <br><br>Beef fattening is a common practice in many parts of the country today. 
		It was Rotary club of Mymensingh who pioneered this activity through a 
		Rotary Foundation supported project. Training, demonstration, 
		de-worming, treatment, nutrition and loan were organized and the results 
		are now well visible and vibrant around the country. There are many 
		similar ground breaking works initiated by Rotary that are having 
		lasting impact in our society in the areas of literacy, arsenic 
		mitigation, poverty alleviation and healthcare. <br><br>Rotary celebrated its 100th birthday on February 23, 2005. Any 
		anniversary, be it for a birthday, a wedding, or the founding of an 
		organization, is a time to reflect. We pause for a moment to reflect 
		upon the past and plan for the future. It is heartening to note that as 
		we celebrated our 100th birthday, we also accomplished a lot during the 
		current Rotary year in Bangladesh. <br><br>Rtn Panna Lal Saha, President of Rotary club of Agrabad who is a plastic 
		surgeon, vowed to complete 100 cleft lip surgeries before February 23, 
		2005 free of cost. He completed his mission on January last. Rotary club 
		of Brahmanbaria Titas established the first Rotary Geriatric Treatment 
		Center in Bangladesh on 16 th February, while Rotary club of Comilla 
		added a maternity wing to their eye hospital on February 10th. Rotary 
		Club of Gulshan, together with Rotary clubs of Banani, Dhaka Newcity and 
		Uttara organized a rally in Gulshan Dhaka to motivate others to join 
		Rotary. Rotary club of Dhaka North West also organized a huge rally on 
		February 25, 2005. <br><br>Another innovative project has been completed by my home club, Rotary 
		club of Metropolitan Dhaka. The club joined hands with Rotary club of 
		Metropolitan Calcutta to produce a CD of Tagore songs sung by artistes 
		of both Bangladesh and India. Sales proceeds of the CD in India went for 
		the benefit of children in India. Income within Bangladesh is being 
		donated today to HICARE, an organization dedicated to the welfare of the 
		hearing impaired. The first installment of Tk 750,000 was handed over on 
		February 23, 2005 through the hands of the President of Bangladesh. 
		Having seen Rotary's work, Dutch-Bangla Bank Foundation came forward to 
		donate Tk 1.5 million to HICARE. <br><br>With active encouragement of the district and financial assistance of 
		AMCHAM, Rotary clubs of Dhaka Central and Metropolitan Dhaka have been 
		working jointly to rehabilitate the flood displaced Jamdani Weavers. 
		Under this scheme, 300 looms have been provided and three low cost 
		houses, above flood level, are being built for three needy families 
		there. <br><br>Many other Rotary clubs have undertaken centennial projects in 
		Bangladesh, the cumulative effects of which will have positive impact on 
		our society. The free Friday clinic run by Rotary club of Chandpur, the 
		general hospital managed by Rotary club of Jessore, the orthopedic 
		rehabilitation center run by Rotary club of Jalalabad, the primary 
		schools for displaced children run by Jessore Central and Jessore East 
		Rotary clubs, the pilot school run by Cox's Bazaar Rotary club and the 
		Rotary college run by Rotary club of Dhaka North West are few such 
		examples. Rotary club of Bogra Newtown organized a RYLA training camp 
		for imparting leadership and team building skill to the youth. <br><br>&quot;Rotary club members are ordinary people who accomplish extraordinary 
		things – sometimes through sheer force of will&quot;, remarked Rotary 
		International's centennial President Glenn E Estess Sr. &quot;Thanks to The 
		Rotary Foundation of RI, Rotarians have provided more than $1.4 billion 
		for service projects in more than 166 countries. Rotary supports the 
		world's largest privately funded international scholarship program and 
		sponsors one of the world's most popular youth exchange programs. We 
		have been leaders in the global fight against polio, saving millions of 
		children from this crippling disease. It is our birthday gift to the 
		children of the world&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Well done,&quot; Benjamin Franklin once remarked, &quot;is better than well 
		said&quot;. Therefore, Rotarians
		<strong><em>Celebrate Rotary </em></strong>in this centennial year by 
		creating a better future for our society, because Rotarians are 
		&quot;Builders of Eternity&quot;. On this occasion of the 100th birthday of the 
		world's first service and fellowship organization, Rotary International 
		calls on all to put “ <strong>SERVICE ABOVE SELF</strong>”. </font></p>
