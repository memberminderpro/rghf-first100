					</font>International Rotary District 2420 <br>
					REE Publication ( 002/2004)<br>
					<u><b>1. International Rotary</b></u> <br>
					1.1 Environment and problems that prompted the establishment 
					of Rotary :<br>
					Characteristics of the years before the birth of Rotary can 
					be summarised as follows:<br>
					- Industrialisation in the Western countries were improving 
					with a great speed since the second half of the 19th century 
					(especially in the last 20 years), <br>
					- World population was increasing fast, <br>
					- Classic liberalism dominated economy, <br>
					- Lack of regulations that would take workers’ social rights 
					under guarantee created unrests, <br>
					- Competition between countries, and even hatred and 
					hostility grew bigger, <br>
					- Among this pessimistic picture, the world and humanity 
					were fast approaching a collapse and what was worse was, 
					there was no understanding of this or hearing of alarm 
					bells, <br>
					- As a natural result of this situation, extreme flows like 
					Nihilism and Anarchism were growing with their obvious 
					principles and they were increasing their effects. <br>
					<br>
					This general view provided people’s longing for living in 
					peace, mutual understanding and friendship and strengthening 
					it, formed necessary environment for this longing be 
					supported by great masses, this institution adopted belief 
					and philosophy and paved way for birth of individuals, 
					institutions and establishments who would try to spread 
					this. <br>
					<br>
					One of the most successful of those organisations, probably 
					the first of them is Rotary that has walked on the path of 
					service to humanity since its formation. <font size="4">
					<br>
					<br>
					</font>
					<u><b>1.2 Establishment of Rotary:</b></u> <u>
					(#1)</u><br>
					In early 20th century, a young lawyer called Paul Harris in 
					Chicago, USA was looking for remedies for this negativities 
					full of service to humanity that warmed inside him. <br>
					<br>
					Paul Harris was not alone to feel this way. Mining engineer 
					Gustavus Loehr, Coal Trader Silvester Schiele and Merchant 
					Taylor H&#305;ram Shorey shared the same goal. <br>
					<br>
					Those four US citizens of German, Swedish and Irish descents 
					were later on joined by printer Harry Rulges. They took an 
					oath for working for the welfare and happiness of humanity 
					and society at G. Loehr’s office located on the 7th floor of 
					Unity Building (this building still exists), 127 North 
					Dearborn Avenue, Evanston-Illinois on the 23rd day of 
					February 1905 and Rotary (#2) was born. The name “ROTARY” was 
					adopted in this first meeting. <br>
					_______________________________________________________________<br>
					<br>
					(#1) For broader information on the Foundation of Rotary 
					please look at “Rotary’s History International Rotary 
					No.334’e” and “Rotary Basic Information Volume:1-A Look at 
					Rotary”.<br>
					<br>
					(#2) Important events of 1905 can be summarised as follows:
					<br>
					- Albert Einstein – revealed his Relativity Theory. <br>
					- Marconi – Invented horizontal directional aerial. <br>
					- Portland Manufacturing Co. – Invented plywood. <br>
					- Robert Koch – Won Nobel Prize for Medicines.<br>
					- Jean Paul Sartre and Greta Garbo – they were born.<br>
					- Jules Verne – died.<br>
					In fact, Rotary is the idea pioneer for many national and 
					international association and institutions. Some of the most 
					significant ones of them are:<br>
					- KIWANIS – 1915<br>
					- LIONS – 1917<br>
					- OPTIMIST – 1919<br>
					- ZONTA – 1919 (For Females Only)<br>
					- UNESCO – 1942<br>
					<br>
					In the list of First Rotary Club members there were the 
					names of 30 members and S. Schiele was elected as the 
					president of the first Rotary Club (Chicago Rotary Club).<br>
					<br>
					The goal was very simple. “Establishing friendship, 
					promoting fellowship and professional communication”. This 
					ideal acclaimed great interest and Rotary grew larger with 
					the new joiners. Rotary ideal improved in time and took its 
					current shape: <br>
					<br>
					“Service Above Self”.<br>
					<br>
					In 1907 Rotary fulfilled first Social Service. <br>
					<br>
					Second and Thirds Rotary clubs were founded in San Francisco 
					and Oakland in 1908 and 1909, respectively. <br>
					<br>
					The first Rotary Convention was held in Chicago on 15-16 
					August 1910 (This convention was attended by 60 members). 
					There were 16 clubs and 1500 members at the time. During 
					this convention, “Union of National Rotary Clubs” was 
					founded and Paul Harris was elected president.<br>
					<br>
					Rotary gained an international identity with the foundation 
					of Winnipeg – Canada Rotary Club in 1910. <br>
					<br>
					The slogan adopted in this convention was “He profits most 
					who serves his fellows best”. This slogan became “Service, 
					Not Self” in 1911 and “Service Above Self” in 1940. <br>
					<br>
					Rotary reached Europe in 1911 after the foundation of 
					London, Dublin and Belfast Rotary clubs. <br>
					<br>
					First Rotary Magazine “The National Rotary” was published in 
					1911 and later on it took the name “The Rotarian”. <br>
					<br>
					During the Third Convention held in 1912, standards of the 
					Rotary emblem and Rotary Magazine were determined.<u>(#3)</u> Rotary 
					Ideals were changed into current basics.<u>(#4)</u> <br>
					<br>
					The number of clubs was 100 in July 1914 but in July 1918 
					(during the World War I), this number went up to 530.<br>
					<br>
					First non-English speaking Rotary Club was founded in 
					Havana, Cuba in 1916. ( This club was barred in 1979.) <br>
					<br>
					E. Leslie Pidgeon, the first International Rotary Club 
					President who is not a US citizen, was from Canada – 
					Winnipeg Club and he was elected in 1917 convention. 6th 
					President Arch C. Klumph founded Rotary Foundation in 1917.<br>
					<br>
					Rotary reached South America in 1918 and Asia through India 
					in 1920. Japan joined this chain in 1921.<br>
					<br>
					1000th Rotary Club, York Rotary Club, was founded in 1921 
					and 1500th Rotary Club was founded in England – Bexhill in 
					1923.<br>
					<br>
					When the Edinburgh convention gathered in 1921 there were 
					758 Rotary clubs around the world and 56,800 Rotarians. 
					Rotary approved the “International Service” as the fourth 
					service field during the same convention and Rotarians 
					adopted the duties of representing mutual, good will and 
					peace and developing them by establishing friendly 
					relationships across the globe. <br>
					_______________________________________________________________<br>
					<br>
					<u>(#3)</u> Rotary’s first emblem Barrow Wheel was replaced by Wheel 
					during this convention. <br>
					<br>
					<u>(#4)</u> Rtn. Chesley R. Perry is the leading name in 
					contributing into the development of the International 
					Rotary. This valuable Rotarian, whom Paul Harris called “the 
					Architect of Rotary” was Secretary General of International 
					Rotary for 32 years between the years 1908 and 1942, until 
					he retired. <br>
					<br>
					<br>
					“Barrow wheel”, the first Rotary emblem adopted in 1905 was 
					replaced by the present emblem in 1923. Colours of Rotary 
					Flag (Dark blue and golden yellow) and the emblem were 
					adopted in 1929 Convention. <br>
					<br>
					Number of clubs in 1927 was 3000. <br>
					<br>
					Following motto was adopted in 1940 Havana Convention: 
					“Rotary can not flourish and Rotary ideals can not improve 
					where there is no freedom, justice, loyalty and respect to 
					human rights.” <br>
					<br>
					<br>
					Following this declaration, Rotary left Spain when fascist 
					Franco regime took over and then Cuba with Castro’s rule. It 
					returned to Spain 40 years later, with the death of Franco. 
					It is still absent in Cuba. <br>
					<br>
					The first Rotary Club was founded in Ankara in 1954. Turkey 
					became the 85th country in Rotary society. <br>
					<br>
					International Rotary Management Board at a meeting held in 
					1988, decided to open Soviet Union and socialist countries 
					by taking the changes in those countries into consideration, 
					only with the following conditions: <br>
					- Rotarians should gather freely, <br>
					- Rotary should be able to carry out activities in all 
					service fields, <br>
					- They should freely cooperate the other Rotary clubs in the 
					country or the ones in other countries, <br>
					- They should regularly fulfill their financial duties to 
					International Rotary. <br>
					<br>
					Budapest Rotary Club founded in 1925/26 Rotary period but 
					could not be active due to World War II and communist 
					regimes was revived after 50 years on 26 June 1974. Warsaw 
					followed it on 30 June 1989.<br>
					<br>
					Today, more than 8000 Rotarians in more than 200 clubs in 
					more than 20 former Eastern Block countries such as Albania, 
					Belarus, Bulgaria, Baltic countries, Russia, Slovenia, 
					Ukraine, Mongolia and Kazakhstan provide services to 
					societies they live within, some of them for the first time. 
					It should be happily stated that Almati (Kazakhstan) Rotary 
					Club (District 2430) was founded by Turkey. <br>
					<br>
					<u>As of 30 June of 2003</u>; <br>
					<br>
					1.227.545 Rotarians from 31.561 clubs in 166 countries and 
					529 Districts provide services to their environment, nations 
					and humanity in line with their aims. <br>
					<br>
					There are 7.555 Rotaract Clubs with 173.765 members in 156 
					countries and 9.256 Interact Clubs with 212.888 members in 
					114 countries, all which are linked to those clubs as of 30 
					June 2003.<br>
					<br>
					As of 30 June 2003, 5.298 Rotary Society Unions keep working 
					in 72 countries. There are 184.000 Paul Harris Friends and 
					61.038 Benefactors.<font size="4"><br>

					</font><font face="Arial">
					<u>2.1 Formation of Circumstances</u> :<br>
					<br>
					How was the situation in Turkey during the 40th foundation 
					anniversary of International Rotary (1945s) ? <br>
					<br>
					Turkey, who founded the Republic in 1923 and aimed for a 
					pro-western development age with social revolutions, 
					experienced the hard days of the World War II, even before 
					finding an opportunity to fix its resources that were almost 
					completely exhausted in World War I and Independence war; 
					and it was in an effort to overcome those hardships with 
					great sacrifices. <br>
					<br>
					Efforts to establish democratic order, settling it down and 
					starting a multi-party system had just started.<br>
					<br>
					New initiatives were flourishing in Turkish society and 
					economic field. A new Turkish generation was growing up and 
					this generation was not contended with becoming a soldier or 
					a public servant, as it was the case in the imperial period, 
					but targeting necessary areas and required service fields 
					for country’s development such as trade and industry.<br>
					<br>
					Small number of those who received foreign education and 
					could speak foreign languages was a serious block within 
					this period of initiation, in terms of working with outside 
					world in trade and industry.<br>
					<br>
					Capital savings were very flimsy. Foreign world was hesitant 
					due to limited economic opportunities of the Young Republic.
					<br>
					<br>
					Despite all those negative conditions, there was a 
					development and aim for a more suitable direction, although 
					it was slow. <br>
					<br>
					In 1945, among Ankara businessmen, a non-organic formation 
					of grouping called “S&#305;ra” (Turn) was forming. Ankara’s 
					leading businessmen such as Vehbi Koç, &#304;brahim Atlas, Halil 
					Naci M&#305;hç&#305;o&#287;lu, Emin Halim Ergun, Mehmet Ra&#351;it Çavu&#351;o&#287;lu, 
					Mehmet Ali Sofuo&#287;lu, Burhan Çak&#305;r, Ahmet Kaymak, &#304;brahim 
					Oran, &#350;evki Ta&#351;p&#305;nar, Ali Yüsbirçe&#351;it were attending those 
					meeting held amongst ten to twelve businessmen from various 
					professions in every fortnight in a house and discussing 
					issues like developments in business life and coordination 
					with government authorities. <br>
					<br>
					Despite the obvious similarity between the words “Rotary” 
					and “Turn” and the aims, no link between this group and 
					Rotary can be established. In fact, “S&#305;ra” was not an 
					organized institution. However, it proves the existence of a 
					foundation and willingness formed among Turkish businessmen 
					and the support of the foundation of Turkish Rotary. It is 
					utmost valuable because it was a sign of the need in this 
					respect. <br>
					<br>
					<u>2.2 Birth and Settlement of Rotary in Turkey:</u><br>
					<br>
					Multi-party democracy started in 1945. <br>
					<br>
					Some developments started in Turkey especially in economic 
					field following 1950. Basic view was establishing closer 
					cooperation with the outer world and getting rid of the 
					worries of capitulations. <br>
					<br>
					Turkey joins NATO in 1952. <br>
					<br>
					As a result of all those developments, numerous of foreign 
					companies started to open representations in Ankara. An 
					everyday growing group of foreign businessmen emerged in 
					Ankara. <br>
					<br>
					High numbers – as high as it could not be compared with the 
					previous periods - of military and civil personnel was sent 
					to Europe and especially to America for educational and 
					other reasons. Turkey’s willingness and requirement to open 
					up to foreign countries got bigger. Ankara was on the focus 
					of this. <br>
					<br>
					International Rotary, after taking into consideration that 
					the right conditions were formed in Ankara for Rotary, 
					foresaw the establishment of a Rotary Club in Ankara between 
					1950 and 1952, and asked then-leading names such as 
					Journalist-Author Fatih R&#305;fk&#305; Atay, Journalist-Author Ahmet 
					Emin Yalman, History Professor Ahmet &#350;ükrü Esmer and Ankara 
					Faculty of Law Academician Doctor Münci Kapani to look for 
					opportunities for realizing this aim. These initiatives did 
					not produce any results under the circumstances of the time 
					and failed to become an application.<br>
					<br>
					During the same days, an application for the foundation of a 
					“Lions Club” by businessman &#350;efik Ziya and 15 other founders 
					was rejected for psychological and legal reasons under the 
					circumstances of the time. <br>
					<br>
					Six months after this attempt, Turkish and American 
					businessmen took up the issue once more during a dinner at 
					Karpiç Restaurant and discussed the reasons of Lions 
					application’s rejection and how this hindrance could be 
					overcome. At this stage, Augustin J.Catoni, International 
					Rotary’s District 245 in Lebanon was dealing with the 
					situation as the regional envoy. Due to this interest, 
					O&#287;uzhan Koraltan, manager of one of the companies related to 
					him (American Export Lines – Ankara Branch) was at present 
					during these works. <br>
					<br>
					With the joining of O&#287;uzhan Koraltan – son of then Turkish 
					Grand National Assembly Speaker Refik Koraltan – who got 
					acquainted with International Rotary during his education in 
					the US, efforts to found Ankara Rotary Club found strength 
					and especially contacts and works with official authorities 
					shifted into a positive way. President Celal Bayar’s 
					acquaintance with Rotary during an official visit to the 
					United States of America in 1954 and his visit to some 
					Rotary clubs were also effective in development of Rotary 
					understanding in Turkey.<br>
					<br>
					In the end, a three member Ankara Rotary Club Founding 
					Committee was formed. <br>
					<br>
					- Economist O&#287;uzhan Koraltan<br>
					- Merchant Nail Avunduk<br>
					- Law Assistant Prof Dr. Mukbil Özyörük <br>
					<br>
					The Club postponed the application to be made to Interior 
					ministry for a while for preparation of Internal and main 
					Regulations and for translation of International Rotary’s 
					regulations into Turkish for this purpose. Adaptation 
					between International Rotary and Turkish regulations was 
					established. <br>
					<br>
					Works that started in summer of 1953 were completed 
					successfully early 1954 and the first Turkish Rotary Club, 
					Ankara Rotary Club held it first meeting at Ankara Palas on 
					24 March 1954. <font size="2">

					<br>
					On the date Turkey joined Rotary, Rotary was providing

					<br>
					In the months that followed the foundation, Ankara Rotary

					Vecdi Diker had great contributions in the construction of 
					the first Tractor Factory, Minneapolis Moline.<br>
					<br>
					Rotary spearheaded the introduction of US Pennsylvania

					<br>
					<br>
					<u>2.2 Development of Rotary in Turkey and Phases</u>:<br>
					<br>
					The first two years that followed the foundation of Ankara 
					Rotary Club passed with the works of introduction of Rotary, 
					translations of documents related to Rotary and works to 
					adapt them to regulations. During this period, Second Term 
					Club President Rtn. Cevat Girin’ and then Prime Ministry 
					Undersecretary Ahmet Salih Korur were beneficial.<br>
					<font size="4">
					<br>
					</font>In the beginning, Ankara Rotary Club was under District 245 
					that covers Lebanon, Egypt, Cyprus, Sudan and Kuwait. After 
					a short while, International Rotary included Turkey in the 
					Management Consultancy where Iran, Israel and Greece were 
					in.<br>
					<br>
					Number of Ankara Rotary Club members was around 40 in the 
					first years and almost half of them were with foreign 
					citizenship. Member selection was made with strict rules. 
					Since the foreigners had the majority among guests, since 
					its foundation, Ankara Rotary Club held meetings bilingually 
					(Turkish and English). It is one of the very rare Rotary 
					clubs, as a “Bilingual Rotary Club”.<br>
					<br>
					In 1956 O&#287;uzhan Koraltan transferred his business to 
					Istanbul. A pre-agreement was reached with International 
					Rotary for foundation of a second Rotary club in Istanbul. 
					Istanbul Rotary Club was founded with the valuable works of 
					the founders O&#287;uzhan Koraltan, R&#305;fat Bereket, &#304;smail Hakk&#305; 
					Kutbay, Kaz&#305;m Ta&#351;kent, Eli Rosental, and Hilmi Naili Barlo, 
					under the auspices of Ankara Rotary Club on 8 February 1956.
					<br>
					<br>
					Istanbul Rotary Club received an official status with a 
					decision of Council of Ministers (dated 28 February 1957 and 
					number 4/8754) and held its first meeting at Istanbul Hilton 
					Hotel. Istanbul Rotary Club was given a Charter dated 24 
					July 1957 by International Rotary Club Vice President 
					Agustin Catoni on 23 December 1957. <u>(#7)</u><br>
					<br>
					Turkey’s third Rotary club, Izmir Rotary Club was founded 
					with the valuable works of Nejat Eczac&#305;ba&#351;&#305; and John Caouki 
					who were employed to found it by &#304;stanbul Rotary Club. Izmir 
					Rotary Club held its first meeting at Kültür Park Ada 
					Gazinosu on 9 January 1961 with the founders Sadi Aral, 
					Cemil Atalay, Muvahhit Atamer, Semih Süreyya Birsel, Macit

					club was given a Charter dated 2April 1962 by International 
					Rotary Club on 3 December 1963.<u>(#8)

					<br>
					The first attempt to found Izmir Rotary Club was made with 
					newspaper advertisements on 4 September 1959, in line with 
					the Club’s main regulations, under the auspices of Istanbul 
					Rotary Club by John Caouki and founders Alp Türksoy, Faruk 
					Tunca, Hakk&#305; Türegün, Nevres Gökçe, Osman Kibar, Süreyya 
					Çolak and &#350;evki Filibeli. However, the foundation of club 
					was delayed for one and a half year because of My 27 
					Military Coup. <br>
					<br>
					An 8 November 1962 reply by International Rotary Secretariat 
					’to an application of Ankara Rotary Club in 1962 made to 
					International Rotary’s Zurich Bureau, approved the 
					foundation of Rotary clubs in &#304;zmit, Adana, Samsun, 
					Eski&#351;ehir, Bursa and Trabzon, and sent required forms to 
					Ankara Rotary Club. Those clubs were founded later on. <br>

					With the foundation of Management Consultancy, growth of 
					Rotary in Turkey accelerated. Number of clubs was;<br>
					• 8 in 1968, <br>
					• 11 in1970 , <br>
					• 14 in 1972 , <br>
					• 16 in1974 , <br>
					• 21 in1975 , <br>
					• 22 in 1976 , <br>
					• 27 in 1977 , <br>
					• 30 in 1978 . <br>
					During the 10 year long Management Consultancy period, the 
					growth rate was 2.4 clubs per year (24 clubs in total).<br>
					<br>
					“District 243” of International Rotary was formed in Turkey 
					in 1980. <br>
					<br>
					Number of clubs during the period of District 243 was as 
					follows, as of the year ends: <br>
					• 31 in 1980, <br>
					• 32 in 1981 ,<br>
					• 39 in 1982, <br>
					• 50 in 1983 , <br>
					• 57 in 1984 , <br>
					• 60 in 1985 , <br>
					• 69 in 1986 , <br>
					• 79 in 1987 . <br>
					<br>
					Growth rate within this period of 7 years was 7 clubs per 
					year (49 clubs in total). <br>
					<br>
					As a result of this development, as of the start of 
					1988-1989 Rotary term, International Rotary accepted the 
					division of Turkey into two districts, District 242 with 40 
					clubs and District 243 with 42 clubs. Growth got bigger with 
					the foundation of two districts, and District numbers were 
					changed as 2420 and 2430 in 1993-1994 term but then in the 
					end, three districts were formed with the numbers 2420, 2430 
					and 2440, in 1994-1995 term. <br>
					<br>
					Works in Social, Professional and International fields 
					fulfilled by Turkish Rotary within the 50 years passed since 
					it was first founded are published at www.rotary2420.org .<br>
					<br>
					The “Polio-Plus” Project that aims to end fatal child 
					diseases such as polio by vaccinating hundreds of thousands 
					of children in Turkey is a great work of Rotary on its own.
					<br>
					<br>
					Thousands of projects such as construction of permanent ones 
					like schools, rehabilitation centers and hostels, project of 
					transformation of Nemrut Mountain into a National Park, 
					Istanbul Tuzla Kindergarten and Primary Schools for 
					Hearing-Impaired Children, Istanbul Tepeba&#351;&#305; Istanbul 
					Governorship Children Home Building, Society Union works for 
					development in villages and non-returned university 
					scholarships… The full inventory of services is so wide that 
					even those clubs who gave these services can not remember 
					them. <br>
					<br>
					Alongside those works, significant services in promoting 
					Turkey in science, culture, arts and sports are accepted and 
					attached great value by official authorities as much as by 
					Turkish public. <br>
					<br>
					Turkish Rotary provides Turkish youth;<br>
					• opportunity of attending short term camps in abroad, 
					attending a school for every educational year and studying 
					with voluntary academicians, and<br>
					• it organizes forums within the country, gives leadership 
					training, holds camps in various fields, and creates 
					opportunity to know the country by exchanging students 
					between cities.<br>
