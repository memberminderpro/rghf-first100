				<font face="georgia" size="2">The Rotary Club of Bangalore came 
into existence on 5th June 1934 and is the 7th Rotary club in Pre-Independence 
India.<br>
<br>In a meeting held at the erstwhile Central Hotel, Bangalore (behind the present &quot;House of 
Friendship&quot;) on 16th May 1934, it was decided that a Rotary Club be formed in Bangalore. Thanks 
to the persuasive efforts of 
				<a href="../../../leaders/howland/index.htm" target="_blank">
				<strong>Rtn. Douglas C. Howland</strong></a> and the response he elicited, the provisional 
Rotary Club of Bangalore was constituted with 25 Charter members. The Sponsor Club was Rotary Club 
of Madras in Chennai.<br>
<br><strong>Rtn.L.J. McIver, I.C.S., Collector C&amp;M Station, was the Charter President.</strong> 
A splendid function marked the formal inauguration and was well attended by a large gathering of 
eminent personalities. The Chief guest was Lt.Col. CTC Plowden, a British resident in Mysore. 
As envoys of goodwill and fellowship, five Rotarians from the Rotary Club of Madras were also 
present for this inauguration. <br>
<br>In a touching gesture, Rtn. Maj. Money, Past President of Rotary Club of Madras, presented 
a beautiful Presidential Hammer made of Ivory and Gold to the Club which is preserved even 
today. He emphasized that the Hammer was not a present merely, but the forging of a link in the 
bond of fellowship so essential in all Rotary endeavours.<br>
<br>The Charter by Rotary International was presented to the Rotary Club of Bangalore on October 
27th, 1934. It was Rtn. H. W. Bryant of the Rotary Club of Bombay and Honorary Commissioner for 
Afghanistan, Burma, Ceylon and India, who represented Rotary International and handed over the Charter. 
This historic meeting was held at the West End Hotel in a hall resplendent with 
Rotary motifs, the walls draped with International Fags and the Rotary Wheel.<br>
<br>For several years thereafter, the Rotary Club of Bangalore 
held its weekly meetings at the Bangalore Club and later shifted its meeting 
venue to the Central Hotel. The Foundation stone for the current Club premises 
was laid by the Past District Governor Rtn.Dr. M.N.Mahadevan on 2nd June 1963.<br>
<br>From a membership of 25 in 1934, the Rotary Club of Bangalore 
has come a long way with many accomplishments to its credit during the past 7 
decades, growing to its current strength of almost 270 members, implementing 
numerous projects serving the community at large, and is well poised to 
celebrate its Platinum Jubilee in 2009.<br>
<br><strong>The Rotary House of Friendship</strong><<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/bangalore01.gif" width="200" height="120" align="right">
The Rotary Club of Bangalore Charitable trust purchased as site for the club in a 
most prestigious place, and by coincidence, in the same compound where Rotary in 
Bangalore was born. This was possible through the good offices of Rtn. Gopalan 
Nair. The site was purchased on 28<sup>th</sup> Jan 1961 and Rtn, PDG Dr. M. N. 
Mahadevan, laid the foundation stone on June 2, 1963. Sri. V.V. Giri the Vice 
President of India inaugurated the House of Friendship on July 7, 1967. The 
Rotary Club of Bangalore became the first club in India to establish Rotary 
House of Friendship.<br>
<br><strong>Nagadevanahalli School Project</strong><br>
The Rotary Club of Bangalore charitable trust brought 71 Guntas of
<img border="0" src="../images/bangalore02.gif" width="200" height="126" align="right">
land on survey No.3/2 and 3/3 for a price Rs. 500/- on 14.4.61 and put up a school 
for benefit of community around Nagadevanahalli. A craft centre and a clinic are 
functioning effectively.<br>
During 1996-98 additional building measuring 2500 sq.ft. was built at an estimate cost 
of Rs. 12 lakhs.&nbsp; The school is run by Seva Bharati Voluntary Organisation.<br>
<br><strong>Books Bank Scheme</strong><br>
The Book Bank Scheme was jointly sponsored by Rotary club of Bangalore and Ramanarayan 
Chellaram &amp; Sons Charitable Trust in 1955. This was taken up as a Silver Jubilee 
project of the club in 1959. More than Rs. 1,00,000/- was donated by Ramnarayan 
Chelaram &amp; Sons Trust &amp; generous amount were obtained from State Government, 
Govt. of India and other Donors.<br>
<br><strong>Shankara Rotary Library</strong><br>
<img border="0" src="../images/bangalore03.gif" width="250" height="185" align="right">
The Rotary Club of Bangalore along with Sri. Sringeri Sharada Math has setup a 
library incorporating largest information technologies for children studying 
upto pre-degree courses.<br>
The Shankara Rotary Library aims to simulate and awaken the curiosity in young 
minds to seek knowledge beyond text books and prescribed curriculum. There are 
very few modern children's libraries in Bangalore and the Shankara Rotary 
Library is designed to act as a referral centre to complement the school 
libraries.<br>
<br><strong>Rotary- TTK Blood Bank</strong><br>
<img border="0" src="../images/bangalore04.gif" width="199" height="122" align="right">
This project was conceived by a few Rotarians of our club and by the constant and 
timeless persuasion of PDG P.T. Kasturi became a reality and today the Rotary- 
TTK blood Bank is serving thousands of people in our community who are direly in 
need of Blood and its components. A voluntary blood bank started by TTK Group 
and managed by young ladies from the office of TTK group joined hands with the 
Rotary Club of Bangalore under the leadership of Rtn. PDG. P.T. Kastury 
establishing a Rotary TTK Blood Bank.<br>
<br><strong>Mobile Micro Surgical Eye Unit</strong><br>
<img border="0" src="../images/bangalore05.gif" width="200" height="128" align="right">
Under a matching grant project, with the participation of district 3310, a mobile 
micros surgical eye unit was established in 1995. A unique project was devised 
to provide high tech ophthalmic sciences, to people living in small towns and 
villages at their doorsteps. The Maratha Medical and Educational Charitable 
Trust looks after the day to day working of this unit.<br>
RTN Dr. Ramnarayan Rao plans to add a portable diode laser photo-coagulator at a 
cost of Rs.13 lakhs under the matching grant scheme. This is going to be a dream 
project of 98-99.<br>
<br><strong>Rotary Muthappa Attavar Hospital</strong><br>
In 1994 a hospital project to provide medical facilities was established
<img border="0" src="../images/bangalore06.gif" width="200" height="125" align="right">

lakhs. Muthappa Attavar Trust has provided Rs.25 lakhs and runs the hospital. 
The Bangalore hospital supervises the services provided. <br>
A matching grant project has been initiated to provide maternity centre. This 
hospital caters to 12,000 people belonging to 7 villages.<br>
<br><strong>Burns Ward</strong><br>
<br>The idea of setting up of a Burn Ward to help burns patient was initiated in 1982, who 
Rtn. R.K. Baliga was the President. The untiring efforts of Dr. Prithvi Raval 
and Rtn. M.K. Dattaraj resulted in a massre fond Raising Project in 1984 and in 
1985 the Burns Ward was inaugurated by R. I. President Dr, Carlos Careseeo at 
the Chinmaya Mission Hospital. It is a fully equipped ward with special bath 
treatment facilities, in-built oxygen services, etc. keeping in mind that 
cleanliness and striate conditions were of utmost importance to burns patients.<br>
