        From a lonely man's hunger for friendship, Rotary has become the most
        influential international service organization today. For one club with 
        only four members 94 years ago, Rotary today has more than 29,000 clubs 
        with an estimated 1,200,000 Rotarians in 160 countries. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">
        <br>
        <br>
        </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">
        But Rotary did not become truly international until it extended to Asia 
        in <strong>1919 when&nbsp;<span class="775223403-10092001">first </span>clubs 
        were organized in the Philippines, China and India</strong>, thus 
        attesting to the universality of Rotary by proving that its principles 
        possessed the vitality and appeal, to transcend not only national 
        boundaries and language limitations but also the barrier of race, 
        religion and creed.<br>
        <br>
        Rotary was an alien import when the <strong>first club in China was 
        established in 1919 in Shanghai</strong>, and there was considerable 
        doubt as to whether it would acclimatise itself to the Chinese soil. 
        Other clubs were started in Tientsin in 1923 and in Beijing in 1924, but 
        until 1931 these three remained the only Rotary clubs in all China.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"><br>
        <br>
        </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">
        Then Rotary began to develop and the number of clubs was increased to 
        seven by 1932 - the four additional clubs were established in Hong Kong 
        and in the three Manchurian cities of Dairen, Harbin and Mukden. The 
        life of the three clubs in Manchuria was, however, very brief as they 
        were forced to cease functioning following the Japanese occupation in 
        the same year.<br>
        <br>
        Through the efforts of the late Dr. C.T. Wang, (close relative of P.P. 
        Wing Chow of Victoria Rotary Club) eleven new clubs were organized in 
        different parts of China between 1932 and 1935. The 15 clubs which were 
        then in existence in China together with the Rotary Club of Hong Kong, 
        and three other Rotary clubs in the Philippines, were in 1935 
        Constituted into Rotary District 81, with the late Dr. C.T. Wang elected 
        as its first district governor.<br>
        <br>
        When the Japanese invaded Shanghai in 1937, there were 23 clubs in 
        China, one in Hong Kong and three in the Philippines, having a total of 
        1,211 Rotarians. They were then divided by Rotary International into 
        three Rotary Districts as follows:<br>
        <br>
        District 96 which replaced 81 in October 1937 covered roughly South 
        China, Hong Kong and the Philippines with 11 clubs and 529 members; 
        District 97 for Central China with 11 clubs and 475 members and District 
        98 for North China with five clubs and 207 members.<br>
        <br>
        In 1938, the Philippine Islands were detached from District 96 of South 
        China, but Macao was included in this district although there was no 
        Rotary club in the Portuguese enclave at that time.<br>
        <br>
        In the following four years prior to the outbreak of the Pacific War in 
        December 1941, many of the Rotary clubs in the Chinese cities under the 
        Japanese occupation were still permitted to operate according to the 
        official directories of R.I.. Those four years recorded the existence of 
        25 clubs in 1938 and 26 clubs each in 1939, 1940 and 1941. The 26 clubs 
        included those in <br>
        Chungking, Chengtu, Changsha and Sian, which were still free from the 
        Japanese occupation.<br>
        <br>
        The Japanese changed their policy following the outbreak of the Pacific 
        War by closing down all the Rotary clubs in Japan and in all other 
        territories occupied by them. Chungking, the capital of wartime China, 
        was bombed in four successive years, yet the Chungking Rotary club had 
        never stopped functioning. Rotary International records showed that the 
        Chungking club continued to hold weekly meetings as usual; but not 
        always in the same place. When warning of an approaching air raid was 
        received, a new meeting place was selected and word was passed along to 
        its members.<br>
        <br>
        Changsha, another city in free China, was three times the chief target 
        of the Japanese attack. The club there had to move out from the city on 
        each Japanese onslaught, but still carried on its meetings.</span></p>
        <p align="justify" style="margin: 10 3"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">
        After the outbreak of the 2nd World War, Shanghai Rotarians stopped 
        functioning as a club because the Japanese would not allow it to meet 
        regularly, but the members continued for some time to get together 
        informally every week, often times in their homes.</span></font></td>
        <td style="height: 296.25pt; padding: 3pt; width: 450;" vAlign="top" height="395">
        <p align="justify" style="margin: 10 3">
        <span style="font-size: 10pt; ">
        Rotary in China had shown great vitality as well as courage. 
        Notwithstanding frequent air raids and other dangers, Rotarians had 
        succeeded in establishing four new Rotary clubs during the war years 
        when Western China held its own. These four clubs were organized in 
        Lanchow, Wuchow, Kweilin and Kweiyang. There was a total of nine clubs 
        with 295 members in China by August 1945 when Japan surrendered to the 
        Allied Forces.<br>
        <br>
        Because of air raids and loss of territory Rotary in China had suffered 
        a great setback, but the outlook immediately after the end of the 2nd 
        World War was very encouraging. As soon as an area was freed from 
        Japanese control, Rotarians at once took steps to re-establish their 
        clubs.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"><br>
        <br>
        </span>
        <span style="font-size: 10pt; ">
        The clubs in the three Rotary Districts, 96, 97 and 98 which were the 
        first ones to be readmitted to Rotary International membership after the 
        war, were the Rotary Clubs of Hong Kong, Shanghai, Hankow and Beijing. 
        The three districts were jointly supervised by the first post-war 
        Districts Governor, again in the person of the late Dr. C.T. Wang.<br>
        <br>
        The following year the three districts were again separately 
        constituted, but in 1950 they were renumbered as District 57 for South 
        China, including the island of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao. District 58 
        for Central China and District 59 for North China. The number of clubs 
        in the three districts had grown to 22 with 1,091 Rotarians by the R.Y. 
        1950/51. Incidentally, Taiwan was grouped with Japan in the pre-war 
        days.<br>
        <br>
        The Rotary Club of Hong Kong was suspended during the Pacific War after 
        operating for ten years since 1931, but revived in 1946. It sponsored 
        the Rotary Club of Macao in 1947 and the Rotary Club of Kowloon in 1948. 
        The first post-war club in Taiwan was organized in 1948.<br>
        <br>
        The situation in China deteriorated tremendously and the Rotary movement 
        on the China mainland came to a complete standstill following the 
        Communists coming to power in 1949. Later, when only four of the 22 
        post-war clubs in the three districts were able to function, with one 
        each in Hong Kong, Kowloon, Macao and Taipei, Rotary International saw 
        it fit to remove the district status of our area on July 1, 1951. The 
        late Dr. Arthur Woo was appointed by R.I. as its first Administrative 
        Advisor for the Hongkong-Macao-Taiwan area.<br>
        <br>
        Determined to regain district status, Rotarians in Hong Kong and Taipei 
        exerted greater efforts in promoting new clubs. The Rotary Club of Hong 
        Kong sponsored the Rotary Club of Hongkong Island East and the Rotary 
        Club of Hongkong Island West in 1954, while the Rotary Club of Taipei at 
        the same time succeeded in organizing eleven additional clubs in Taiwan. 
        As a result, Rotary International decided to constitute the clubs in 
        Hongkong-Macao-Taiwan area under District 345, effective as from 1st 
        July 1960 when we had altogether 17 clubs with 764 Rotarians. Its first 
        post-war-district governor was the late Rtn. K.T. Kwo from <br>
        Taipei. Just a coincidence, the writer of this article was inducted into 
        Rotary in the same year - 1960, hence he had the opportunity to witness 
        the reinstatement of a new district - 345.<br>
        <br>
        Rotary had been growing fast in Taiwan after the 2nd World War and it 
        had branched out another two new districts, viz., District 346 in 
        Central Taiwan and District 347 in Southern Taiwan in the years 1978 and 
        1984 respectively.<br>
        Due to the rapid growth, the number of Rotary clubs mushroomed to 101 in 
        District 345 (Hongkong-Macao-Northern Taiwan) during the Rotary Year 
        1986/87. It was just impossible for a district governor to oversee all 
        these clubs, hence a new district was born, known as District 348 
        (Northern Taiwan) whereas District 345 remained unchanged, except the 
        area covers only Hongkong-Macao with a total of 27 clubs as from 1st 
        July 1987 under the leadership of District Governor Raymond Wong.<br>
        <br>
        At present, there are 48 clubs in District 345 (renumbered 3450) which 
        comprises of 6 in Macao and 42 in Hong Kong. With the reunification of 
        Hong Kong to China since the handover of sovereignty on 1st July 1997, 
        Rotary has been reinstated in China under the Special Administrative 
        Region of China starting with 42 clubs and approximately 1,600 members</span><style="font-size: 9pt"><span style="font-weight: bold; "><font size="2">
