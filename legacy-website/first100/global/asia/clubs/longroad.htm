		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19"  width: 50%>RI President Richard 
		&quot;Rick&quot; D. King lead a delegation of Rotary leaders to China and 
		Southeast Asia on a mission with huge implications for Rotary growth 
		through extension. The trip, which follows the Asian Presidential 
		Conference in Taipei (22-24 March 2002), gave President King the 
		opportunity to personally welcome into the Rotary family the members of 
		the new provisional Rotary clubs of Beijing and Shanghai. The delegation 
		will also meet with government officials to discuss policy issues 
		relating to Rotary extension. Once the Chinese government finalizes 
		policies and laws to allow international, nongovernmental humanitarian 
		groups, such as Rotary clubs, to operate freely, the provisional clubs 
		can be officially chartered, opening up a golden opportunity for Rotary 
		growth in this vast nation of more than 1.2 billion people.<br><br>The 
		provisional clubs in Beijing and Shanghai continue Rotary's rich history 
		in China, which dates back to 1919, when Seattle Rotarian Roger Pinneo, 
		a world traveler, decided to bring the Rotary movement to Asia. That 
		July, with the help of Dr. Julean Petit, a longtime resident in China, 
		Pinneo charted the country's first Rotary club, in Shanghai. Rotary's 
		spirit of volunteerism took root, and the next two years saw clubs 
		formed in other major cities, including Peking, Nanking and Soochow (now 
		Beijing, Nanjing and Suzhou, respectively).<br><br>During the early 
		days, Rotary clubs in China were actively involved in local community 
		projects. Rotarians in the city of Hankou sponsored a leprosy clinic and 
		raised money to support a school for the blind. Shanghai Rotarians 
		established &quot;Beggar Town,&quot; which at one time provided shelter, schooling 
		and vocational training for more than 1,500 men, women and children.<br>
		<br>In the late 1930s and early 1940s, war often disrupted Rotary 
		activities. But despite the constant threat of air raids, many clubs 
		continued their humanitarian work. Rotarians who fled war zones in other 
		parts of China gathered in Shanghai and Hong Kong and focused on refugee 
		relief.<br><br>As an international organization, Rotary in China 
		attracted a large number of local businessmen, as well as expatriates 
		and visiting Rotarians from around the world. Regular Rotary meetings 
		often became forums for cultural exchanges.<br><br>A Rotarian from 
		DeKalb, Ill., USA, who was on military duty in 1943 in the southwestern 
		city of Kunming, described a local Rotary meeting in a letter home: &quot;One 
		member of the club has recently been in Calcutta and he spoke to the 
		members on life and customs of India. The talk was interesting. It was 
		also of peculiar interest to hear a Chinese [person] describe the 
		civilization, life and problems of a neighboring country.&quot; By July 1947, 
		Rotary in China consisted of three districts totaling 32 clubs.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style25" height="193" src="http://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/asia/clubs/longroadimages/factory.jpg" style="float: left" width="244">Young 
		residents learn shoemaking skills at a Rotary-supported shelter and 
		vocational camp for Shanghai's indigent population, circa 1941<br><br>
		After the People's Republic of China was formed in 1949, the new 
		Communist government associated many Western organizations with 
		colonialism; and Rotary, which was founded in the United States, 
		suffered. Most Rotary clubs were dissolved by the Chinese government by 
		1952, and Rotary International terminated the remaining ones in 1953. 
		Many Rotarians moved to Hong Kong and Taiwan, where they joined clubs 
		and remained a vital and continuing force in the Rotary movement. (The 
		first Rotary club was established in Hong Kong in 1930, and Taiwan 
		formed its first club in 1948.)<br><br>In the late 1970s, China ended 
		decades of self-imposed isolation and opened its doors to the outside 
		world, reviving a dream held by Rotarians around the world: to return 
		Rotary to China. In 1982, RI President Stanley E. McCaffrey visited 
		China to explore the possibility. Subsequently, the RI Board of 
		Directors approved the formation of a pilot club in Beijing, but that 
		action proved premature. After a 1987 trip to China by RI 
		President-elect Royce Abbey, the board began to explore the possibility 
		of organizing Group Study Exchanges to China. At the same time, Rotary 
		leaders continued meeting with Chinese leaders, hoping to make Rotary 
		known to the people of China.<br><br>In 1989 Rotary seized the 
		opportunity to help improve the lives of children in China. As part of 
		its PolioPlus program, The Rotary Foundation authorized a US$15 million 
		grant to the World Bank to construct a polio vaccine production plant in 
		Kunming. The same year, the Foundation also donated more than $900,000 
		to train Chinese technical personnel to manage the country's polio 
		eradication efforts.<br><br>International PolioPlus Committee Vice 
		Chairman Herbert A. Pigman says the polio eradication program helped 
		Rotary gain the trust and enthusiastic cooperation of the Chinese 
		government.<br><br>&quot;China did an excellent job in carrying out this 
		massive public health initiative,&quot; says Pigman, noting that more than 
		100 million children were immunized, reducing polio cases from 10,000 in 
		1981 to 1,191 in 1992.<br>During the last decade, the Foundation 
		contributed another $2 million, supplemented by $750,000 from Japanese 
		Rotarians, to buy oral polio vaccine. In appreciation, China invited 
		Past RI President Royce Abbey, then RI Foundation Trustees chair, and 
		then Trustee Jiichiro Frank Nakajima to observe a National Immunization 
		Day in January 1994. Thanks to Rotary's efforts, China, along with other 
		countries in the western Pacific region, was declared polio-free in 
		October 2001. <br><br>
		<img class="auto-style25" src="http://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/asia/clubs/longroadimages/kids&flags.jpg" style="float: left">International 
		Flag Day celebration at the Rotary Club of Shanghai in 1929<br><br>In 
		addition to PolioPlus, other Rotary-sponsored service projects helped to 
		build credibility for the organization in China. For example, Rotary 
		clubs from Seattle, which helped charter the first club in China, have 
		built Rotary schools and constructed water projects for villages in 
		Shaanxi province.<br>Rotarians in Hong Kong have donated money and labor 
		to build housing and schools for flood victims in Jiangxi province.<br>
		<br>In 1992, a Group Study Exchange team from China's southeastern city 
		of Hangzhou visited Rotary clubs in Tennessee and Virginia. Since then, 
		many similar exchanges have taken place, with Rotary clubs in the United 
		States and Hong Kong taking the lead.<br><br>The idea of organizing a 
		Rotary fellowship group in Beijing started in 1995, when Rotarian 
		Hermann Heid, a German native, left Hong Kong to begin a new job in 
		Beijing. At the farewell party organized by his club in Hong Kong, 
		fellow Rotarians issued a challenge: &quot;Why don't you organize a 
		Rotary-style meeting there?&quot; Little did Heid realize that the challenge 
		would become his obsession.<br><br>Building a Rotary fellowship group in 
		Beijing was not easy. Heid started by searching for expatriate Rotarians 
		in Beijing and contacting other foreign business people who had 
		expressed an interest in joining Rotary. After six months of frenetic 
		preparation, Heid convened the first Rotary fellowship meeting on 18 
		June 1996.<br><br>&quot;Eight people attended, and I was the only Rotarian,&quot; 
		recalls Heid. &quot;We decided at that meeting to continue to meet weekly and 
		pretend to be Rotarians.&quot;<br><br>That small group flourished. During a 
		visit to Beijing in 1996, President-elect Bhichai Rattakul, who was then 
		chairman of RI's Asia Extension Committee, encouraged them to continue. 
		&quot;Bhichai's support was a major step forward for us,&quot; says Heid.<br><br>
		&quot;We were constantly under the microscope of the Rotary world,&quot; he adds. 
		&quot;We were scrutinized by passing Rotarians and visiting Rotary leaders. 
		Chinese government officials also wanted to find out who we were.&quot;<br>
		<br>Heid says the fellowship group lived up to the expectations of 
		Rotarians and demonstrated the humanitarian nature of Rotary to the 
		Chinese. During the past five years, members have donated clothing and 
		air-conditioning equipment to an orphanage for disabled children, 
		assisted in disaster-relief efforts, purchased tents to be used as 
		classrooms in China's northwestern province of Qinghai and worked with 
		the Rotary Gift of Life program to send children from China's inland 
		provinces to the United States for open-heart surgery.<br><br>While the 
		fellowship group in Beijing was taking shape, a similar Rotary group was 
		started in Shanghai. When James Wang of Taiwan, a past club president, 
		opened an ice cream factory in Shanghai in 1996, he invited many 
		Rotarians who also did business in the city to attend the celebration. 
		That event gave rise to the idea of forming a fellowship group. It won 
		the support of the Rotary Club of Taipei, which named a China committee. 
		The Taipei club offered Rotarian Jim Lee a small budget to coordinate 
		the activities.<br><br>Starting in 1997, the group met bimonthly. In 
		October 1998, Randy Eastman, a Canadian businessman, joined the group 
		and began to play an active role. Under the leadership of Eastman and 
		Andre Leys, the group started to meet monthly and published a monthly 
		newsletter. The group raised funds to help children in China's Nei 
		Monggol (Inner Mongolia) region and today works closely with the Gift of 
		Life program to provide open-heart surgeries in hospitals in Shanghai.<br>
		<br>The Final groundwork for elevating the clubs to provisional status 
		was laid in November 2000, when China's Ministry of Civil Affairs 
		invited then RI President-elect King, RI President Frank Devlyn, and 
		former RI Director Bhichai Rattakul (now president-elect) to visit 
		Beijing. The Rotary leaders met with high-level Chinese officials and 
		others to discuss the possibility of reintroducing Rotary to China. 
		Rotary leaders also noted the impressive humanitarian work carried out 
		by the two fellowships, which constituted a diverse group of 70 members 
		from more than 20 countries. Finally, in June 2001, after careful 
		deliberations, the RI Board of Directors formally recognized the 
		provisional Rotary clubs of Beijing and Shanghai.<br><br>Perhaps this 
		bright beginning to a new era of Rotary in China was foreshadowed a 
		decade ago, when Hong Kong Rotarian Bob Wilson made a serendipitous 
		discovery in a local antique shop. He noticed that the store's doorstop 
		was an old, brass bell. He looked closer and recognized the design of 
		the Rotary wheel on its surface and this engraving: &quot;Donated by Stanley 
		F. Howard, 20 August 1925. Rotary Club of Peking.&quot; Wilson immediately 
		purchased this piece of history, which had already survived most of a 
		turbulent century, and in June 1998 donated it to the Beijing Rotary 
		Fellowship Group in honor of its 100th meeting.<br><br>&quot;I can't tell you 
		how excited I was,&quot; says Heid, who retired to Australia in 1998 but 
		returned to Beijing in September 2001. &quot;It was an emotional homecoming 
		of a symbol, a link between our predecessors and us. I am waiting for 
		the day when the bell rings in the coming of a new Rotary era in China.&quot;<br>

		presented a check to support a center for people with disabilities. The
