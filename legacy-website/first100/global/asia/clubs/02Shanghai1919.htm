	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19"  width: 50%>The Rotary Club of 
		Shanghai (RCS) was first chartered in October 1919. The Club operated 
		from 1919 to 1941 and from 1946 to 1949, being forced to cease in 1941 
		due to war, and in 1949 due to political and legal restrictions. In 
		order to gain a deeper grasp of what it was like to be a member of the 
		Rotary Club of Shanghai in the first half of the twentieth century, it 
		helps to understand the social, political, and economic context in which 
		the Club operated. Thus, this historical overview will parallel the main 
		events in the history of the RCS with events in the history of China, 
		especially as they relate to Shanghai.<br><br>The Birth of the Rotary 
		Club of Shanghai, 1919<br><br>On July 9, 1919, Seattle Rotarian 
		Roger D. Pinneo met with Messrs. J. Petit, W. S. Fleming, A. B. 
		Rosenfeld, J. J. Gorman, and W. L. Johnstone at the Palace Hotel to 
		discuss the possibility of organizing a Rotary Club in Shanghai. (Mr. 
		Pinneo was part of the International Association of Rotary Clubs, and 
		had the authority to organize new clubs.)<br><br>Two days later, the 
		group met again for further discussion. They were joined by Messrs. R. 
		Buchan, E.H. Dodge, Thos. Sammons, N. L. Downs, E. O. Baker, and F. J. 
		Raven. There had been some doubt regarding the role of the Rotary Club 
		in a club-ridden city like Shanghai.<br><br>At this meeting, a motion was 
		passed that the RCS would aim to be international in its membership and 
		its objects, dedicated to “international membership for the development 
		of international relations in China.”<br><br>A third meeting was held on 
		July 19. New attendees included Messrs. T. C. Britton, G. F. Ashley, C. 
		B. Perkins, A. B. Hensler, Carl Crow, N. Peffer, R. W. Gilmore, G. L. 
		Treadwell, and A. H. Jennings. At this meeting, a report on the 
		Committee on Constitutions and By-Laws was read and adopted.<br><br>
		Finally, on July 20, 1919, Mr. Pinneo sent a cable to Chicago that read:<br>
		“Interotary Chicago: Shanghai organized. Julian Petit Chairman, mailing 
		particulars. Pinneo.” RCS had 35 names on its proposed Charter 
		membership list.<br><br>The group continued to hold meetings. On July 
		24, a report by the Committee on Permanent Organization was unanimously 
		adopted, and members elected the Officers and Directors for the Club’s 
		first year: President Julian Petit, Vice-President A. B. Rosenfeld, 
		Secretary E. O. Baker, Treasurer R. Buchan, and Directors Hon. Thos. 
		Sammons, F. J. Raven, and W. L. Johnstone. A final organizational 
		meeting was held on July 31.<br><br>The Rotary Club of Shanghai was 
		officially chartered on October 1, 1919 as Club #545.<br>When the Club 
		finally received its Charter in January, the Club’s weekly newsletter 
		The Pagoda reported that President Julian Petit held it under his arm as 
		though it were his first child.<br><br>(The first issue of The Pagoda was 
		published on September 2, 1919, demonstrating the Club members’ 
		motivation to begin Club operations even a month before official 
		chartering.)<br><br>The first organizational meetings took place merely 
		two months after the beginning of the May Fourth Movement.<br><br>On May 4, 
		1919, thousands of students carried out a demonstration in Beijing 
		expressing dissatisfaction with the Treaty of Versailles.<br><br>The 
		incident initiated the New Culture Movement across the country, which 
		rejected monarchism and traditionalism in favour of nationalism and 
		modernity.<br><br>This was the spirit of the times in China when the RCS was 
		born.<br><br>On Chinese Membership, 1921<br><br>RCS was the first Rotary 
		Club to be established in China. Rotary International (RI) soon 
		contacted the RCS asking for help in identifying other Chinese cities 
		into which Rotary might extend.<br><br>In 1921, RCS members were asked to 
		provide brief reports on Chinese cities that they were familiar with, 
		including a survey of the city’s population, institutions, business and 
		professional men, along with some opinion from an RCS member on the 
		likely success of efforts to organize and maintain a Rotary Club there.<br><br>
		Rotary International also encouraged RCS to recruit Chinese members into 
		its Club, believing that the Shanghai Club would realize its period of 
		greatest success when its membership consisted of a considerable number 
		of native business and professional men.<br><br>RCS President H. C. Norman 
		replied that unfortunately, in his experience, the vast majority of 
		Chinese did not demonstrate the Rotary spirit, noting that the Chinese 
		had a highly developed family instinct but lacked the sense of altruism 
		that lay at the core of Rotary’s purpose and objective. After three 
		years, only four of RCS’s members were Chinese, a small minority of its
		total of nearly 70 members. Norman suggested that the cities into which 
		Rotary might possibly extend would be those most open to foreigners.<br>
		<br>The Lincheng Incident, 1923<br><br>The Lincheng Incident in the 
		fifth year of the Rotary Club of Shanghai demonstrates the zealousness 
		of the young Club. It also reflects the Club’s early lessons on the 
		nature and boundaries of Rotary.<br><br>On May 6, 1923 the Blue Express 
		traveling from Pukow to Tsientsin was ambushed and derailed by bandits. 
		One British man was killed, and 27 foreigners and 300 Chinese passengers 
		taken hostage.<br><br>Among the captives were two members of the Rotary Club 
		of Shanghai: J. B. Powell and L. C. Solomon.<br><br>Four days later, the RCS 
		held a two-hour meeting regarding the best course of action to take in 
		pursuing the captives’ release. The discussion was intense, running from 
		1:00 pm to 3:00 pm with no one leaving the room despite the fact that 
		everyone was supposed to return to their offices by 2:00 pm.<br><br>There 
		was strong disagreement between those who were in favour of direct 
		action, and those who were in favour of calling on Rotary International 
		for assistance.<br><br>The latter group, headed by Past President Julian 
		Petit, was eventually successful; a cable was sent to Chicago asking 
		Rotary International to call upon all the Rotary Clubs worldwide to urge 
		their governments to take action demanding the protection of life and 
		property in China. (At the time, Rotary International consisted of 1,444 
		clubs in 27 different countries.)<br><br>Rotary International did not 
		reply until two weeks later, with the simple statement that the matter 
		would be discussed at the next meeting of the International Board on 
		June 14.<br><br>The RCS was outraged, especially Dr. Petit, who wrote a 
		letter to Rotary International indicating that Rotary had lost 
		considerable prestige and value in the eyes of the members of the 
		Shanghai Club, and that a similar instance in the future would most 
		likely lead some to resign.<br><br>The captives were released on June 13, 
		one day before the meeting of the International Board.<br><br>Rotary 
		International replied to Dr. Petit’s letter in September, explaining 
		that Rotary was an international organization, and must therefore 
		refrain from being involved with national matters in order to avoid 
		putting itself in embarrassing situations that bring no compensatory 
		results.<br><br>RI did not believe that it had the power to ask the 
		governments of the world to give orders to the government of China. 
		Furthermore, sending such a request would set a precedent for other 
		Rotary Clubs to call on RI to take its side on a national issue.<br><br>Much 
		debate ensued in The Pagoda regarding the roles of Rotary Headquarters 
		versus local Clubs in handling local matters, the importance of 
		discussion versus action in times of crisis, the constitutional rules 
		requiring that Rotary activities steer clear of politics, and the 
		constitutional rules requiring that Clubs cooperate with RI.<br><br>The 
		Shanghai Club became infamous for its attempt to appeal to all Rotary 
		Clubs worldwide over the Lincheng matter.<br><br>The Club’s growth is 
		perhaps best seen in contrasting the Lincheng incident with the maturity 
		with which the Club handled the Japanese attack on Shanghai in February 
		1932 as well as the second Sino-Japanese War of 1937-1945, when national 
		and political differences among Club members were set aside in order 
		that the Club could focus its energies on helping the victims of war.<br>
		<br>RCS Meets Paul Harris, 1935<br><br>In March of 1935, Rotary founder 
		Paul Harris paid a three-day visit to Shanghai. RCS President Percy Chu 
		hosted his visit, and the Club held a reception and banquet for Mr. 
		Harris to honour the 30th anniversary of the founding of Rotary. At the 
		banquet, Mr. Harris gave a speech titled “Strength and Principles of 
		Rotary: Its Past, Present and Future”.<br><br>Percy Chu later recalled 
		Harris as being “a very happy chap.”<br><br>On the Formation of a Second 
		RCS, 1936<br><br>In March of 1936, RCS members Fong Foo Sec and Dr. C. 
		T. Wang spoke to the Club on the proposal to form a second Rotary Club 
		in Shanghai. They hoped to form a Chinese-speaking Rotary Club in the 
		city, and the translation of Rotary literature into Chinese was already 
		well under way.<br><br>Rotary International had been contacted regarding the 
		proposal.<br><br>RI was in favour of organizing an additional Club in 
		Shanghai, but on the basis of locality, not language.<br><br>In August of 
		1948, it was proposed that for the purpose of establishing a second 
		Club, the first Shanghai Club would cede the territory west of Honan 
		Road, south of Soochow Creek, and northwest of Minkuo Road.<br><br>As far as 
		we know, however, this second Club was never established.<br><br>A possible 
		reason is that the Civil War between the Chinese Nationalist and 
		Communist Parties at the time made Club organization and operation 
		increasingly difficult, until Club activities were finally forced to 
		stop in December 1949.<br><br>Nonetheless, the name, meaning, and objects of 
		the Rotary were successfully translated into Chinese.<br><br>Wartime 
		Struggles<br><br>The second Sino-Japanese War began on July 7, 1937. 
		Shanghai was captured on November 12, and Nanking on December 13. The 
		RCS immediately began efforts for refugee relief. RCS’s efforts helped 
		thousands of refugees survive through the winter. (More detail on RCS’s 
		Civilian Refugee Aid efforts can be found on page 7.)<br><br>In December of 
		1941, the level of conflict in Shanghai intensified.<br><br>United States 
		and Britain had entered the war, which meant that the American and 
		British Settlements in Shanghai were no longer neutral territory.<br><br>
		Amidst the chaos, the Club was forced to cease its regular meetings, 
		although members continued to meet informally in each other’s homes, in 
		order to maintain fellowship and to promote goodwill and understanding 
		between the different nationalities that they represented.<br><br>In 1942, 
		19 members of the RCS whose native countries were part of the Allied 
		powers were repatriated.<br><br>The remaining American and British members 
		were interned at various camps around Shanghai, including 5 at Haiphong 
		Road Camp, 7 at Pootung, 2 at Yuyuen Road, 3 at Ash Camp, 1 and Lungwha, 
		and 9 at Chapei.<br><br>At the end of 1944, these camps suffered a 
		shortage of food.<br><br>The Shanghai Club arranged to deliver special 
		Christmas parcels to each internee, and to each member of his family.<br><br>
		World War II ended in August 1945, and the Japanese officially 
		surrendered in China on September 9.<br><br>By October, all the internees 
		had been released.<br><br>The Rotary Club began to reorganize on November 
		9, although special provisions had to be made owing to the heavy effects 
		that the War had had on the members’ business and property.<br><br>Some 
		members’ businesses had been completely dislocated, and others were 
		unable to access overseas funds due to the lack of banking 
		facilities.<br><br>As a result, it was agreed that meetings would be held 
		bi-weekly so that members would not feel overburdened by transportation 
		and financial difficulties.<br><br>The publication of The Pagoda was 
		temporarily put off due to the high cost of printing.<br>The Club, 
		however, was determined to resume its normal activities by January 1, 
		1946, including the collection of regular RI dues and Club dues, and the 
		enforcement of rules regarding regular attendance.<br><br>Rotary 
		International agreed to waive the per capita taxes owing from January 1, 
		1942 to December 31, 1945 for the RCS, but required that the Club 
		formally apply for readmission to membership within RI, which all other 
		Clubs in similar circumstances were also required to do.<br><br>(RCS’s 
		charter had been formally cancelled on December 31, 1943.)<br><br>The RCS’s 
		application for readmission was granted on March 27, 1946.<br><br>RCS in 
		the Peoples Republic of China Era<br><br>The end of World War II was not 
		the end of war for China.<br><br>The Civil War between the Chinese Communist 
		Party and the Nationalist Guomindang followed immediately, and civil
		strife ensued for the next four years.<br><br>The Civil War finally ended 
		with the official establishment of the People’s Republic of China on 
		October 1, 1949, and the retreat of Guomindang leader Chiang Kai-shek to 
		Taiwan on December 10, 1949.<br><br>The new Communist regime had no place 
		for a club like the RCS.<br><br>Under the new system, social welfare was 
		considered to be the responsibility of the government; non-governmental
		organizations were therefore considered to be anti-revolutionary.<br><br>
		Furthermore, foreign businesspersons were considered to represent 
		imperialism, a form of economic invasion and an obstruction in the 
		transformation towards a national planned economy.<br><br>By December of 
		1949, the RCS was forced to stop its activities.<br><br>Furthermore, on 
		October 19, 1950, the government passed the Interim Provision on the 
		Registration of Social Organizations, which required all social 
		organizations in China to register with the government.<br><br>Organizations 
		that were considered “counterrevolutionary” insomuch as they “threaten 
		the state security and the interests of the people” were not allowed to 
		incorporate; those that were already incorporated were to be stopped and 
		dissolved.<br><br>By 1952, all Rotary Clubs in China had been closed.<br>In 
		1965, the year just before the onset of the Cultural Revolution, all of 
		RCS’s property was confiscated by the Chinese government.<br><br>In 
		1978, Deng Xiaoping announced China’s policy of economic opening and 
		reform.<br>Rotarians in Shanghai began to meet informally in 1993.<br><br>
		Rotary International’s Asian Extension Committee, with special help from 
		Seattle Rotary’s International Service Committee, began their efforts to 
		re-establish Rotary in Shanghai and in China.<br><br>(The Rotary Club of 
		Seattle was keen on helping re-establish the Rotary Club of Shanghai 
		because of the historical connection between the two Clubs.)<br><br>When the 
		Chinese government finally gave its approval, Rotary International 
		granted the Clubs of Shanghai and Beijing provisional status in June 
		2001.<br><br>On February 8, 2006, the Rotary Club of Shanghai was officially 
		re-chartered as Club #60725.<br><br>Within the 50-year gap in the 
		history of Rotary Club of Shanghai, there were many occurrences that 
		significantly impacted the Chinese people.<br><br>The country suffered 
		widespread famine from 1959 to 1961 as a result of Great Leap Forward 
		policies; the famine claimed an estimated 22 million lives.<br><br>The 
		Cultural Revolution began in 1966, and lasted 10 years until the death 
		of Mao Zedong in 1976.<br><br>On July 28 that same year (1976), the city of 
		Tangshan suffered an earthquake that measured 7.8 in magnitude and 
		claimed over 240,000 lives, making it the deadliest earthquake in the 
		20th century.<br><br>The Rotary Club of Shanghai was resilient in the face 
		of the many social, political, and economic barriers that it had to 
		face. No matter what the circumstances, Shanghai Rotarians were 
		determined to continue their pursuit of fellowship and service as best 
		they could.<br><br>The Club grew significantly in the first three years of 
		its operation.<br><br>Dedication to Service: Some of RCS’s Major 
		Projects<br><br>The Rotary Club of Shanghai engaged in numerous projects 
		to help the people and community of Shanghai and China.<br><br>The RCS was 
		known for being ambitious in its goals, and resolute in the face of 
		opposition. Although some of the Club’s visions were bigger than its 
		capabilities and therefore could not be accomplished (e.g. the proposed 
		Big Brother Movement, Trachoma Campaign, and Shanghai City Sanitation 
		Project), many of its successful projects were crucial to saving and 
		improving the lives of the needy.<br><br>The RCS was especially dedicated to 
		serving children, victims of war, and those with illnesses.<br><br>Below we 
		briefly describe four of the main projects undertaken by the Rotary Club 
		of Shanghai: the Russian School for Boys, Christmas Toy Drives, the 
		Institution for Chinese Blind, and Civilian Refugee Aid efforts in 1937.<br>
		<br>In 1924, Shanghai Rotarian Walter “Rex” King appealed to the Club 
		that something be done about the large number of poor Russian children 
		living on the streets of Shanghai.<br><br>He wrote in The Pagoda, the weekly 
		newsletter of the Rotary Club of Shanghai: “We dare not refuse this 
		charge to help these little outcasts in a strange land through no fault 
		of their own”.<br><br>The Club acted right away, setting up a boarding 
		school on Rue Chapsal to look after as many children as could be 
		accommodated.<br><br>By 1925, the Russian School housed 69 students, but 
		there were many more who unfortunately could not be accommodated due to 
		limited space and funding.<br><br>The RCS, therefore, set out to build a 
		bigger school in the French Concession.<br><br>The Club raised over $100,000 
		for the project, including $17,760 from a dinner, dance, and raffle held 
		at the Majestic, and $32,814 from a beauty contest that sent the winner 
		to Hollywood and gained much attention from the Shanghai press.<br><br>RCS 
		member Hans Berents, a civil engineer, offered to supervise the building 
		of the school free of charge.<br><br>The French Municipal Council, in 
		addition to providing some of the additional funding<br>necessary, 
		leased land for the building of the school at a cost of $1.00 per annum 
		in perpetuity.<br><br>The new school was located at 13 Rue Doumer (now 
		Donghu Road), and in 1932 provided education for 148 students, 
		including 70 boarders. King was elected as the first President of the
		Board of Trustees, on which Berents and another RCS member E.S. 
		Thellefsen also served.<br><br>Christmas Toy Drives<br><br>Each December from 
		the early 1920’s through 1941 (when club activities were forced to cease 
		because of war), the Rotary Club of Shanghai devoted much effort to 
		preparing Christmas packages to the underprivileged children of 
		Shanghai.<br><br>The Club appealed to the public for donations of old toys, 
		which Club members would repair and deliver to children in various
		orphanages and children’s institutions around the city, along with such 
		necessities as toothbrushes, soap, and towels.<br><br>The members of the 
		Club contributed the best of their abilities and resources to the 
		project.<br><br>U. S. “Hark” Harkson provided the premises of his Egg 
		Products Manufacturing Company (Henningson Produce Co., Ltd.) to serve 
		as the toy hospital, and in 1931 also gave ice-cream bars to each of the 
		children that the Club visited.<br><br>Former Club member E. W. “Dick” 
		Brewer of Ford Hire Services offered to collect and deliver the 
		donations free of charge.<br><br>T. J. Holt of Nanking Theatre arranged for 
		a performance of children’s cinema where the admission price was an old 
		toy, in order to encourage the privileged children of Shanghai to 
		participate in the project.<br><br>Those in media and advertising publicized 
		toy collections, including appeals made to local schools, and 
		arrangements made with local department stores to display signs that 
		read, “Send your old toys to the Rotary Club, and buy your New Toys 
		here!”<br><br>In 1931, RCS visited 1500 children, and donated an 
		additional sum of $1083 to various institutions, including Ms. 
		Henderson’s School, Chapei Baby Clinic, Providence Orphanage, Door of 
		Hope Children’s Refugee, First Russian School, School for Poor Russian 
		Children, Little Sisters of the Poor, and Mrs. Herman Liu’s Beggar 
		Guild.<br><br>Eight years later, the Club visited 6000 children in 59 
		different institutions, and donated an additional $1,830.<br><br>The Club 
		continued their Christmas Drive even during wartime, providing special 
		treats and gifts for 2,700 children in refugee camps in 1937, the 
		first Christmas of the second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945).<br><br>As 
		noted in one of the thank-you letters that the RCS received in 1923, the 
		gifts not only made the children happy, but they also helped raise the 
		health standard of the city.<br><br>
		The Institution for Chinese Blind was founded by Reverend George B. 
		Fryer in 1912.<br>Reverend Fryer’s son, also named George B., was a 
		member of the Rotary Club of Shanghai in the 1940’s, and along with his 
		wife dedicated their lives to serving the blind.<br><br>Unfortunately, the 
		Blind School was forced to stop its activities in 1941 when Fryer, of 
		British descent, was imprisoned in one of the concentration camps during 
		the Japanese occupation.<br><br>Fortunately, the school resumed its 
		operation upon Fryer’s release in 1945.<br><br>Located at 4 Edinburgh Road 
		at the corner of Brenan Road (now Jiangsu and Changning Roads), the 
		Blind School served 45 boys in 1924, ranging from ages 3 to 21.<br><br>The 
		boys were skilled at manufacturing steamer chairs, table, baskets, 
		hardwood furniture, and other hand-made products; the sale of these 
		products provided much of the school’s funding. The boys were also known 
		to be excellent singers, despite the fact that they could not read notes 
		and lyrics.<br><br>They also demonstrated impressive athletic abilities, 
		especially in the performances they gave during visits by the members of 
		the RCS.<br><br>In addition to hosting outdoor parties for the boys and 
		taking them on trips through Shanghai, the RCS also built a 40 by 20 
		feet room and a kitchen for the institution.<br><br>As well, the RCS tried 
		to provide treatment and to find a cure for trachoma – a contagious and 
		preventable disease that leads to blindness, the chief cause of which 
		was a lack of sanitation.<br><br>Trachoma was a serious problem in China 
		during the three decades that the Rotary Club of Shanghai operated.<br>
		<br>Civilian Refugee Aid, 1937-1945<br><br>The second Sino-Japanese War 
		officially started in July of 1937.<br><br>Japan captured Shanghai on 
		November 12, and the capture of Nanking on December 13 was the beginning 
		of what is now known as “The Rape of Nanking”.<br><br>By the end of 1937, 
		there were 400,000 refugees in the Nantao Safety Zone of Shanghai, all 
		in desperate need of food and shelter.<br><br>The estimated population of 
		the French Concession for the last four months of 1937 was 1,500,000: 
		one million more than its normal population of 450,000.<br><br>Likewise, 
		the estimate for the International Settlement was 1,250,000 above its 
		normal population of one million.<br><br>Amidst the scene of destruction, 
		chaos, death, and poverty, the Rotary Club of Shanghai refused to be 
		overwhelmed, and instead sprung into action. The Club dipped into its 
		reserves to fund local medical and relief organizations, with the goal 
		of providing as much support as possible to those with special 
		qualifications in providing aid.<br><br>One of the emergency hospitals was 
		funded almost entirely by the RCS, and the RCS also single-handedly 
		built, equipped, and staffed a mobile clinic and dispensary.<br><br>The club 
		also supported an emergency maternity hospital, and built and maintained 
		four units of a camp, which provided shelter for 1000 refugees, and 
		sleeping platforms and food for thousands.<br><br>At Christmas, the Club 
		distributed special treats and gifts to 2,700 children living in refugee 
		camps.<br><br>By the end of 1937, the Rotary Club of Shanghai had raised 
		$10,000 for its Refugee Relief Fund, and an additional $40,000 was 
		received from other Rotary Clubs worldwide.<br><br>RCS’s own funds were 
		distributed among such organizations as the Civilian Refugee 
		Convalescent Hospital, Refugee Children’s Hospital, Leper Mission, and 
		Refugee Orphans Child Welfare Association.<br><br>Funds were also allocated 
		for medical supplies for relief camps, and milk for babies at a Russian 
		nursery.<br><br>These organizations helped provide refugees with food, 
		shelter, blankets, and warm winter clothes.<br><br>The RCS also provided aid 
		for other war-torn areas outside Shanghai; 50% of the funds received 
		from abroad were sent to other cities, including Nanchang, Hangchow, 
		Wusih, Wuhu, Nanking, Hankow, and Changsha.<br><br>RCS member Alfred 
		Morley recalls that the war deeply impacted members of the Rotary Club 
		of Shanghai, which included members of many different nationalities, 
		including both Chinese and Japanese.<br><br>He noted in the April 1938 issue 
		of The Rotarian that the Club had dedicated two meetings to discussing 
		the pros and cons of politics in Rotary, in the end deciding that 
		“nothing would be gained and possibly much would be lost” if Rotary 
		intervened in politics.<br><br>Thus, the Club decided to set aside any 
		political differences, and to instead dedicate their energy to helping 
		the victims of war.<br><br>The nature and size of these projects illustrate 
		the strong heart, mind, and will of Shanghai’s Rotarians.<br><br>It is also 
		worth noting that the Rotary Club of Shanghai did not simply donate 
		money to the various charities and institutions that it supported, but 
		also developed a close relationship with each of them.<br><br>Club members 
		spent much time with those they were helping, and sought to better 
		understand their situation in order that the Club could improve its 
		service to them.<br><br>Model Leaders: Some Prominent Members of the RCS<br>
		<br>Of course, every member of the Rotary Club of Shanghai was a model 
		citizen simply in light of the fact that he was a Rotarian – a 
		respectable businessperson, and devoted to serving both the local and 
		international communities.<br><br>Many members of the RCS were leaders in 
		their field of expertise, whether it was politics, education, medicine, 
		commerce, or otherwise. Proof for this can be found in the large number 
		of RCS members who were featured in such books as &quot;Who’s Who in 
		China&quot; and &quot;Men of Shanghai and North China&quot; published during their 
		time.<br><br>Below we briefly outline the main accomplishments of four of 
		the most prominent members of the Rotary Club of Shanghai: Dr. C. T. 
		Wang, Mr. Fong Foo Sec, Dr. New Way Sung, and Mr. Percy Chu.<br><br>Dr. 
		C. T. Wang<br><br>Cheng-ting Wang (1882-1961) was born in Zhejiang Province. 
		He completed a Master’s degree at Pei-Yang University in Tianjin in 
		1900.<br><br>Later, Mr. Wang studied at Michigan University for a year 
		(1907-1908), and received a Bachelor’s degree from Yale University in 
		1911. In 1920, St. John’s University in Shanghai granted Mr. Wang an 
		honorary Doctorate of Law degree.<br><br>Dr. C. T. Wang played a major role 
		in shaping China’s political scene.<br><br>After the collapse of the 
		imperial Qing dynasty in 1911, Dr. Wang assisted in organizing the 
		provisional government of 1912.<br><br>After the Dr. Sun Yat-sen founded 
		the Republic of China, Dr. Wang was appointed the Vice-Minister of 
		Industry and Commerce of the first Republican Cabinet in 1913.<br><br>Dr. 
		Wang also served as Vice-President of the Republican Senate that year, 
		and was the General Secretary of the National Committee of the 
		Chinese Y.M.C.A. one year later.<br><br>Dr. Wang contributed much to the 
		various peace-making projects of China’s Nationalist Government. He was 
		one of China’s chief delegates to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, 
		aimed at drafting treaties between the Allied powers and the defeated 
		Central powers after the end of World War I. In 1922, he was China’s 
		chief commissioner to the Sino-Japanese joint Commission to settle 
		the Shantung question.<br><br>He was also the Director-General of the 
		Sino-Russian Conference of 1927, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs in 
		1922, 1925, 1926, and 1928-1931.<br><br>In 1936, the year leading up to the 
		second Sino-Japanese War in China, Dr. Wang was a member of both the 
		Central Executive Committee and the Central Political Council of the 
		Guomindang. (Guomindang led China’s War of Resistance against Japan from 
		1937-1945.)<br><br>Dr. Wang became a member of the Rotary Club of Shanghai 
		in 1921.<br><br>In March of 1922, however, Dr. Wang’s membership was changed 
		from active to honorary at the suggestion of RCS President H. C. Norman, 
		because Dr. Wang’s job so often required him to travel out of Shanghai 
		and China.<br><br>In 1936-1937, Dr. Wang was the Governor of District 81 of 
		Rotary International, but was forced to resign when his post as the 
		Chinese Ambassador to the United States required him to move to 
		Washington, D.C. (RCS Past President Fong Foo Sec replaced him as 
		District Governor that year, effective October 1936).<br><br>Dr. Wang also 
		served as a Director of Rotary International in 1944-1945, the last year 
		of World War II.<br><br>Mr. Fong Foo Sec was born in 1869 to 
		a family of farmers in Toishan, Guangdong. At the age of 13, he went to 
		the United States, where he studied and worked for 24 years, attaining a 
		Bachelor’s degree at the University of California and a Master’s degree 
		in English Education from Columbia University.<br><br>In 1906, Mr. Fong 
		returned to China to teach English at government colleges in Guangdong, 
		and was awarded a Doctor of Literature degree following the government 
		examinations.<br><br>Mr. Fong was one of the leading editors and writers 
		in China. For more than 20 years, he was the Chief English Editor of the 
		Commercial Press, the largest book publishing company in Shanghai.<br>
		<br>He was also dedicated to a number of educational and welfare causes. 
		For example, he was part of the Management Committee for the Institution 
		for Chinese Blind, the Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese 
		Y.M.C.A., a Director for the Chinese Mission to Lepers, the first 
		Vice-Chairman of the National Child Welfare Association, and a member of 
		the Executive Committee of the Church of Christ in China.<br><br>Mr. 
		Fong became a member of the Rotary Club of Shanghai in 1922. He served 
		as Club President in 1931-1932, during which Shanghai suffered a 
		Japanese attack (February 1932) that led to much tension between the 
		Chinese and Japanese members of the Club.<br><br>Mr. Fong notes, 
		however, that the Club was able to overcome their ethnic and political 
		differences and continue to exemplify the Rotary spirit.<br><br>Several 
		Chinese members of the RCS had been forced to evacuate their homes in a 
		hurry after Japanese military authorities took control of the Hongkew 
		District; Japanese RCS members lent them the passes necessary to 
		re-enter the district, in order that they could collect their personal 
		belongings.<br><br>Mr. Fong was a Director of Rotary International in 
		1933-1934, and had the opportunity to meet Paul Harris, the founder of 
		Rotary. Mr. Fong took over for Dr. C. T. Wang as Governor of District 81 
		in October 1936, after Dr. Wang left for Washington, D.C. as the Chinese 
		Ambassador to the United States.<br><br>Mr. Fong was also a District 
		Governor in the following two years (for Districts 96, 97, and 98 in 
		1937-1938; and Districts 97 and 98 in 1938-1939). Mr. Fong passed away 
		on October 10, 1938.<br><br>Dr. New Way Sung, born on June 14, 1892, was 
		a leader in the field of orthopedics. He attained his Bachelor’s degree 
		at St. John’s University in Shanghai, and then continued his education 
		in the United States, finally obtaining his doctorate degree from 
		Harvard University.<br><br>Upon his return to 
		China, Dr. New became a Professor of Orthopedic Surgery at a number of 
		universities, including the Peking Union Medical College, St. John’s 
		University (which he had previously attended), and the Women’s Medical 
		College.<br><br>He was an important member of numerous medical 
		associations both in America and in China.<br><br>For example, in the United States, 
		he was a Fellow of the American Medical Association as well as the 
		American College of Surgeons; in China, he was the President of the 
		Shanghai Medical Society, the National Medical Association of China, and 
		the Chinese Medical Association.<br><br>Dr. New also served as the Surgeon 
		General to the Army of the National Government of China from 1928 to 
		1930.<br><br>Beginning in 1928, Dr. New served as Superintendent and 
		Chief Orthopedic Surgeon at the Orthopedic Hospital of Shanghai. The 
		institution soon attained international recognition, and was chosen by 
		the Rotary Club of Shanghai to be the main beneficiary of its projects 
		for the year 1931.<br><br>(Unfortunately, Club plans to raise funds for 
		the hospital were delayed due to more pressing concerns of relief for 
		victims of the flood in Hankow (August 22, 1931), and aid for refugees 
		from Japan’s invasion of Manchuria (September 1931) and attack on 
		Shanghai (February 1932).<br><br>Nonetheless, the Rotary Club of 
		Shanghai raised $550 for the hospital in 1930, and $582 in 1931.<br><br>Dr. New 
		formally became a member of the Rotary Club of Shanghai in 1923.<br><br>
		In 1924, he married Ms. Zee Yuh-Tsung in Shanghai.<br><br>They had a child 
		named New Kang Ming.<br><br>Percy Chu<br><br>Zhu Bo-Quan was born on 
		October 2, 1898 in Hangzhou, and at the age of 10 chose for himself the 
		English name “Percy” after he began his studies at a foreign boys’ 
		school in Shanghai.<br><br>He attained his Bachelor’s degree from the University 
		of Shanghai in 1919, and continued his studies in Economics and Business 
		Administration for one year at Columbia University and New York 
		University contemporaneously.<br><br>Because his father urged him to 
		gain practical experience, Mr. Chu began working at one of the leading 
		financial houses in New York.<br><br>Upon his return to China, Mr. Chu 
		became one of the most important bankers in the country.<br><br>Mr. Chu 
		was responsible for the establishment of China’s first Foreign Exchange 
		operation (1921), first Federal Reserve Board (March 1932), and first 
		Clearing House (January 1933).<br><br>He was appointed Associate General 
		Liquidator by the National Government in 1928, and from 1928 to 1931 
		served at the Central Bank of China, first as the Chief Auditor and 
		later as the General Manager.<br><br>Mr. Chu was appointed the Manager 
		of the Joint Reserve Board during the financial crisis that followed the 
		Japanese attack on Shanghai in February 1932.<br><br>All the Chinese 
		banks in Shanghai (the financial centre of China at the time) were part 
		of the Joint Reserve Board, and with Mr. Chu’s direction, the Joint 
		Reserve Board functioned successfully through the crisis.<br><br>Besides 
		banking, Mr. Chu was dedicated to education and social service.<br><br>He 
		established China’s first night college for professional workers, so 
		that business people could continue to increase their knowledge and 
		improve their skills.<br><br>At one time, Mr. Chu was the chairman, manager, or 
		president of over 108 different clubs and organizations, including the 
		Chairman of the Shanghai Central Committee of the China International 
		Famine Relief Commission, the Director of the Chinese Bankers’ 
		Institute, the President of the Association of Institutions of Shanghai, 
		and the President of the University of Shanghai (1942-1945), which he 
		had previously attended.<br><br>Mr. Chu’s expertise in finance made him both 
		a tool and a target in the political turmoil of 20th century China.<br>
		<br>During the Japanese occupation (1937-1945), Mr. Chu was jailed for a 
		month by the Pro-Japanese Wang Jingwei Government because he had refused 
		to cooperate with their requests for his help in establishing a new 
		financial institution in Shanghai. (The Central Bank, the Bank of China, 
		and the Bank of Communication had all been uprooted by the Guomindang.)<br>
		<br>When the Japanese Army arrived in China, Japanese members of the 
		Rotary Club of Shanghai arranged a meeting with the Wang Government, who 
		again asked Mr. Chu to help maintain business activity in Shanghai.<br>
		<br>This time he agreed, and was then instructed to form and serve on a 
		General Committee of Chinese Commercial Banks and Chinese Native Banks.<br>
		<br>After the end of World War II, Mr. Chu was kidnapped, tried, and 
		jailed for two years by Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist Government for 
		being an “economic traitor” by having collaborated with Japanese 
		administration, despite the fact that the Vice-President of the 
		Guomindang had written to Mr. Chu praising his work.<br><br>All of Mr. 
		Chu’s property and finances were confiscated by the Guomindang, and one 
		of his houses later given to Soong Ching-ling, widow of Mr. Sun Yat-sen.<br>
		<br>(This house, located at 1843 Huaihai Zhong Lu, is now open to the 
		public as “The Former Residence of Soong Ching-ling.)<br><br>After the 
		Communist Government took over in 1949, Mr. Chu was accused by Red 
		Guards in 1959 of being an “anti-revolutionary” as a result of his 
		previous connection with the National Government. He was sentenced to 22 
		years of manual labour in a cotton mill factory, where he carried boxes 
		of bobbins to and from machines, swept the courtyard, and cleaned the 
		washrooms.<br><br>As he was working, high-level party cadres would visit 
		him to receive advice complex trading and financial issues, and Mr. Chu 
		would speak to them as he was sweeping in order to prevent anyone from 
		accusing him of being treated with respect.<br><br>Mr. Chu joined the 
		Rotary Club of Shanghai in 1926, and served as the Honorary Treasurer 
		from 1927 to 1933.<br><br>From 1934 to 1935 he was the Club President, 
		and at age 36 was the youngest President in the history of Rotary.<br>
		<br>Mr. Chu also met Rotary Founder Paul Harris during his three-day 
		visit to Shanghai that year.<br><br>In 
		1931, Mr. Chu married Chiang Tong-chi, the daughter of Jiang Yizhi. 
		(Jiang Yizhi was another important figure in the history of banking in 
		China, including being one of the founders and major stockholders of the 
		Zhejiang Industrial Bank.)<br><br>Together, Percy and Tong-chi had three 
		daughters: Jane, Alice, and Mary.<br><br>Mr. Chu passed away on March 
		19, 2001 at the age of 102, after having lived through three centuries.<br>
		<br>There are many other members of the Rotary Club of Shanghai who made 
		significant and unique contributions to their field; these four 
		biographies are merely a small sample of the remarkable personalities 
		that made up the Rotary Club of Shanghai.<br><br>Connie Fan<br>April May
