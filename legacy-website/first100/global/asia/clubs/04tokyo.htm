		Rotary Club of Tokyo was the first Rotary club in Japan on 1 April 1921. 
		When Rotary officially returned to Japan after WWII, the Tokyo club once 
		again on 29 March 1949 became the first club chartered. <br><br>In this 
		photo from April 1949, Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida (seated) watches 
		as George Means presents the charter to club president Masakazu 
		Kobayashi. <br><br>Photo courtesy of Rotary International<br><br>Birth 
		of the Tokyo Rotary Club, Oct. 20, 1920<br><br>In Jan. 1918, Umekichi 
		Yoneyama visited the U.S. as a member of a Japanese financial 
		delegation. In Dallas he was introduced to Rotary by a member of the 
		Dallas Rotary Club, Kisaji Fukushima.<br><br>Upon return to Japan in 
		1920, Yoneyama Organized the first Japanese Rotary Club with himself as 
		President and Fukushima as Club Secretary, and applied for a charter to 
		the International Association of Rotary Clubs which was granted in April 
		the following year.<br><br>Also see
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/davidson/">Jim 
		Davidson</a>: Rotary's special commissioner to Japan<br><br>Changes in 
		the political attitudes of countries sometimes lead to the closure of 
		Rotary Clubs for a period of time. Clubs in Japan, for example, were 
		among the earliest to be created in Asia, but during the second world 
		war closed down. Their story is typical.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/asia/images/tokyoeh01b.gif" style="float: left">In 
		1918 Umekichi Yoneyama from Tokyo had met up with a fellow Japanese, 
		Kisaji Fukushima, of the Dallas Rotary Club during a visit to the United 
		States. Returning home, he began to plan a Rotary Club for his own city, 
		and on October 20, 1920, the Rotary Club of Tokyo was organised with 24 
		charter members under the Presidency of Yoneyama. The Club received its 
		charter in April 1921 and others followed in Osaka, Kyoto, Yokohama and 
		several of the other principal cities in Japan. Yoneyama himself 
		subsequently became a Director of RI in 1926. By 1928, the Tokyo Club 
		was big enough and strong enough to host the Second Pacific Regional 
		Conference, and clubs continued to be formed even as late as 1940 when 
		the Niigata Club was chartered.<br><br>In the Spring of 1935 Paul and 
		Jean Harris made a major journey to the Pacific region visiting Hawaii, 
		China, the Philippines, Australia and New
		<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/asia/images/tokyoeh01a.gif" style="float: left">Zealand, 
		as well as Japan. They arrived at Yokohama on the 'S.S. President 
		Coolidge' with a party of 15 Rotarians and their wives, among them 
		Tsunejiro Miyaoka, a Director of RI from the Tokyo Club and President of 
		RI, Robert E Lee Hill from Missouri. The group were on their way to the 
		Regional Conference to be held that year in Manila, the oldest of the 
		rotary Clubs in Asia. On February 9, 1935 in the grounds of the Imperial 
		Hotel in Tokyo*, then as now the meeting place of the Tokyo Club, Paul 
		and Bob Hill planted a '<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/cities/">Friendship 
		Tree</a>'. A photograph of this is on show in Evanston in the Paul 
		Harris Gallery, item 104. Later in the Maple Club they met Yoneyama 
		again who taught Paul how to use chopsticks.<br><br>Harris was unable to 
		attend a normal meeting of the local Rotary Club, but instead went to a 
		splendid special banquet, presided over by Yoneyama, and there Paul was 
		given the honour of proposing the toast to the Emperor. Then it was off 
		to Kyoto and to Osaka where he met Shozo Murata, the Governor of 
		District 70 which comprised all the 22 Japanese clubs.<br><br>In Osaka 
		the party went to a lunch meeting attended by Rotarians from most of the 
		Japanese Clubs, and there to Harris' surprise, he was presented with a 
		bust of himself for which he had sat months earlier in New York. (Is 
		this perhaps the bust on display in the
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1910harris/paulharris/office">
		Paul Harris Gallery</a> in Evanston, item 21?) From there, the group 
		travelled to Kobe where they rejoined the 'S.S. President Coolidge' for 
		the next stage of their voyage, this time to
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/asia/clubs/02shanghai.htm">
		Shanghai</a>........but that's another story!<br><br>With the change in 
		political attitudes and against the background of the coming war, 
		pressure was brought to bear on Japanese Rotary and the clubs were 
		disbanded in 1940, the Tokyo Club, 214 members strong, closing on 
		September 11. However, the spirit of Rotary did not disappear altogether 
		and members organised a 'Wednesday Club' in December 1940 to keep alive 
		the ideals of the movement.<br><br>On March 29, 1949, the Rotary Club of 
		Tokyo was revived officially by RI and was allowed to keep its old 
		charter number of 855. Clubs elsewhere in Japan were progressively 
		reopened. By 1961 the Tokyo area was sufficiently strong that it was 
		able to host the Annual Convention of RI and in the past 40 years, the 
		number of clubs throughout the country has grown enormously. 
		Metropolitan Tokyo with over 140 clubs is now, with Seoul in Korea, the 
		most populous Rotary city in the world. A handful of clubs in Tokyo, 
		including the original one, provide a helpful simultaneous translation 
		of all business into English.<br><br>*The present hotel replaced the 
		original designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, the foyer of which can still be 
		seen in Meiji Mura near Nagoya, where it has been re-erected.<br><br>A 
		full account of the above story appears in a history of the Tokyo Club 
		published in 1991 for the club's 70th anniversary. The details of the 
		Paul Harris visit can be found in 'Peregrinations 2'.<br><br>
