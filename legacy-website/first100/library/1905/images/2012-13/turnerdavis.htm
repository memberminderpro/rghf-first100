		<br>Two new inductees: Bill Turner and Sue Davis-Hornby, congratulated 
		by RGHF founding member PDG Eddie Blender.<br><br>On Saturday, October 13, 2012, following the RGHF 12th Anniversary 
		Luncheon in Denver at The Inn at Cherry Creek, Bill Turner, the 
		grandnephew of Rotary Founder Paul Harris, conducted an Historic Rotary 
		Tour of Denver. The six participants included driver Bill and organizer

		Greeley PDG Bryan Cooke and Doug Armbrust.<br><br>

		Turner had the good fortune of spending many times with his grand-uncle 
		Paul Harris, both in Chicago and in Denver. Bill Turner is the son of 
		Ruth Turner, who was the only child of Nina May Harris, who was the only 
		sister of Paul Harris, and thus Bill is Nina May’s grandson and is 
		grandnephew of Paul Harris. Bill recalls having met his granduncle when 
		Paul Harris came to Denver in 1941 for the Rotary International 
		Convention. Bill, who would have been twelve at the time, recalls 
		singing a solo for Paul Harris at a Convention Session at the Stanley 
		Hotel in Estes Park. Bill and his brother picked up Paul’s Buick when 
		Paul shipped it by train to Denver. They met Paul and drove to the top 
		of Mount Evans to visit the Rotary emblem there, along with touring 
		around Denver, Estes Park and the front range of Colorado.<br><br>In a 
		written recording by Bill’s mother, Ruth Turner, she states that her 
		grandparents moved to Denver in December, 1894, and resided at 1225 
		Lincoln Street, where now the Colorado History Museum is located, and 
		kittycorner to Saint Mark’s Church. Nina May had attended the Sunday 
		School of the parish priest, Father Houghton, when he was earlier 
		located in New York State across the state line from Fair Haven, 
		Vermont.<br><br>

		years of which I have been writing; in fact, long after you had left 
		Vermont. I refer to the latter period of your life when you were living 
		in Denver. Mother was, at the time, sadly broken; she was totally blind 
		and helpless and then came the great transformation of your life. You 
		waited on mother so tenderly all of those latter years; lifting her from 
		her bed and placing her in her wheel chair. I remember so well how 
		patiently you fed her with a spoon; how you hung on her every word and 
		became her abject slave and when she passed away, you tried so bravely 
		to face life without her. You expiated all shortcomings of former 
		years.&quot; Paul P. Harris, My Road to Rotary, Chapter 20, 1947<br><br>
