	In 1918 Umekichi Yoneyama(1868-1946), President of Mitsui Trust Company, visited the US as a member 
	of a Japanese financial delegation.<br>
	In Dallas he was introduced to Rotary by a member of the Dallas Rotary Club, Kisaji Fukushima 
	(1881-1946), the director of Dallas branch of Mitsui Trading Co. ltd.<br>
	Yoneyama was deeply impressed with the Rotary Spirit, &quot;Service, not self&quot;.<br>
	Fukushima returned to Japan in January 1920 on a mission to organize Rotary Club in Japan, which 
	unfortunately ended unsuccessfully.<br>
	<br>But Yoneyama and Fukushima established the <b>
	<a href="../../global/asia/clubs/04tokyo.htm">Rotary Club of Tokyo</a></b> 
	(the first rotary club in Japan) successfully on October 20, 1920.<br>
	A charter was granted on April 1 the following year (Charter No 855).<br>
	<br>Fukushima then moved to <b><a href="../../global/asia/clubs/osaka.htm">Osaka</a></b> and the 2nd Rotary Club was organized there in November 1922.<br>
	On September 1, 1923 the strong earthquake occurred in the central part of the main island 
	of Japan and Tokyo area was severely damaged.<br>
	Then US ambassador S. E. Woods immediately reported this tragedy to the US government and within 60 
	hours after occurrence of the Kanto earthquake the USS Destroyer appeared in Tokyo Bay to 
	start rescue activities.<br>
	It is said that Japanese Rotarians in Tokyo were so impressed with the effective and immediate 
	action of the US navy that they decided to meet every Wednesday so that they could also start 
	meaningful activities for others.<br>
	<br>Yoneyama was appointed as RI SC (Special Commissioner) and supported the Kobe Club (the 3rd 
	Club in Japan) and the Nagoya Club (the 4th Club in Japan) to organize in December 1924.<br>
	<br>In Kyoto Tojiro Takegami, Ihei Hiro-Oka met to organize a rotary club in Kyoto under 
	sponsorship of the Tokyo Club with other 18 people on July 22, 1925 and to select the 25 charter 
	members on September 19th, the same year.<br>
	The preparatory meeting was held on September 25th at Kyoto Hotel with attendance of Pres Isaka, 
	the mother club, Tokyo RC, to elect the directors of Kyoto RC as<br>
&nbsp;<dl><dt>President </dt><dd>Goichi Takeda (Prof. Kyoto Imperial University)</dd>
	<dt>Vice Pres. </dt><dd>Tojiro Takegami (Pres. Takegami Raw Silk Co.Ltd.)</dd>
	<dt>Secr'y </dt><dd>Takeo Inouye (Prop. Kyoto Hotel)</dd>
	<dt>Tres. </dt><dd>Gisuke Miyamoto</dd>
	<dt>SAA </dt><dd>Kiyoshi Shiomi</dd>
	<dt>Directors </dt><dd>Sobei Kinkozan, Bunzo Shitsukawa, Shotaro Shimomura, Ihei Hiro-Oka</dd></dl>
	The Opening Ceremony of the Kyoto Club (New President Goichi Takeda, New Secretary Takeo Inouye) 
	was held on September 25,,
	<img border="0" src="../images/Kyoto01.jpg" width="281" height="160" align="right"> 
	1925 with attendance of Takeshi Isaka (President, Tokyo Club), Shozo Murata (President, Osaka Club), 
	Shigehiko Ikoma (President, Nagoya Club). The Congratulatory Banquet was held on October 28th with 
	the Special Commissioner Yoneyama and many distinguished guests including A Cooper from Hawaii. 
	The RI charter was granted on December 24th the same year (No. 2184). 
	<div class="clear"></div>
	<img border="0" src="Kyoto02.jpg" width="180" height="121" align="right"> 
	It was such a surprising event for Kyoto Club members to unexpectedly greet Prince of Wales from 
	Britain as the Royal Guest on the weekly meeting on May 7th 1926. This news remarkably highlighted 
	Rotary Club as an international organization for ordinary people to recognize. The First 
	District Meeting of RID 70 was held on April 27 to 28, 1929 at the Kacho Hall of Chion-in Temple 
	in Kyoto chaired by the Governor Umekichi Yoneyama. 
	<div class="clear"></div>
	In February 1935 Paul Harris, his wife Jean Harris and RI President Robert E Lee Hill made a 
	major journey to the Pacific region. They arrived at Yokohama on &quot;the S.S. 
					President Coolidge&quot;. As the bad weather prevented Harris' 
					party from landing for a couple of days, they were unable to 
					attend the normal meeting of the local Rotary Club. But 
					instead they went to a splendid special banquet, presided by 
					Yoneyama. Then it was off to Kobe, Kyoto and Osaka. 
				In 1940 there were 48 clubs and nearly 2,000 Rotarians 
					in Japan. As they took the attitudes against the coming war, 
					the political pressure was brought on Japanese Rotary 
					affiliated to RI Headqurarter in US by the then Government 
					and right wingers but the ideals of the Rotary movement were 
					kept alive. In 1937 ~ 38 a study group of national emergency 
					(pro-nationalist group) was formed however in Kyoto Club 
					with no record left for their activities. There appeared 
					severe confrontation among KRC members whether KRC should 
					continue or discontinue its activities. On August 21st 1940 
					the President Mochizuki declared to disband the Rotary Club 
					of Kyoto and &quot;Wednesday Club&quot; was started on August 28th. On 
					September 19th 1945, soon after Japanese surrender to the 
					Allied Powers of World War II, the Kyoto Hotel was so 
					requisitioned by the US Occupation Forces that the Kyoto 
					Wednesday Club had to change its meeting location to the 
					dining floor of the Daimaru Department Store in Kyoto. 
				Within almost a year after the World War II the two 
					founders of Rotary Clubs in Japan passed away, U Yoneyama 
					(April, 1946) and K Fukushima (September 1946). And Paul 
					Harris also passed away in Chicago in January 1947. We 
					should note a truly great Rotarian, Sir Angus Mitchell, who 
					was the first Australian to be elected as the RI president 
					for 1948-49. He was a very close friend of Paul Harris and 
					is credited with the re-establishment of Rotary in Japan 
					after the end of World War II.<br>
					In September 1948 George R Means (the RI secretary general 
					for Asia) visited Japan and he devoted himself to make 
					Japanese comeback to the international society. His devotion 
					resulted in the restart of rotary activities in Kyoto.
					<img border="0" src="Kyoto03.jpg" width="180" height="121" align="right">The 
					Restarting Ceremony of Rotary Club of Kyoto was held on 
					March 23rd 1949 where George R Means attended and the RI 
					charter was re-granted on April 5th 1949 with the same 
					charter number as before, (No. 2184). The rotary clubs in 
					Japan formed then the new RID 60 and the postwar first 
					district conference was held at the Eiko Building, Doshisha 
					University in Kyoto on April 8th 1950 where Sir Angus 
					Mitchel (IPRI) attended in behalf of the RI President. 
					<div class="clear">
&nbsp;</div>	
	<img border="0" src="Kyoto04.jpg" width="180" height="121" align="right"> 
					On October 16~17 1954 the 60/61 District Conference was held 
					at Kyoto International Exhibition Hall (now Miyakomesse) to 
					celebrate the 50th anniversary, particularly highlighten by 
					the lecture of the Japanese first Nobel Prize laureate, 
					Professor H Yukawa and by the message of RI President 
					Herbert Taylor delivered by Sir Angus Mitchel. 
					<div class="clear">
&nbsp;</div>Two members of Kyoto Club, Genshitsu Sen (in 1988-90) 
					and Ryuichi Kotani (in 1998-2000) served as RI Directors. On 
					May 23 to 26, 2004 the RI's largest convention with 45,381 
					attendees was held successfully in Osaka, chaired by Dr. 
					Genshitsu Sen and on May 22nd the Kyoto-Day, the pre-event 
					of RI Osaka Convention, was jointly hosted by 23 Rotary 
					Clubs in Kyoto to present Japanese culture, art and 
					tradition through the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage sites. 
					On June 19 to 22, 2005, 39,460 Rotarians celebrated 
					centennial in Chicago, Illinois and on October 12th the 
					Rotary Club of Kyoto celebrated the 80th anniversary at 
					Kyoto Hotel Okura with attendance of distinguished guests, 
					number of Rtns and Rtnns from our sister clubs. PP Kenzo 
					Tomita is now DGE (as of October 2008) to serve as RID 2650 
					Governor in 2009-10.
