        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">&quot;On an occasion during the 
        summer of 1900, Paul was invited to dine with a lawyer friend, who lived 
        in Rogers Park, and after dinner he and his friend took a walk, during 
        the course of which they called on several neighborhood stores and shops 
        of various kinds and at each visit his friend introduced him to the 
        proprietor. Paul was deeply impressed with the events of the evening 
        walk. His host had evidently found a good many friends among the 
        business men in his neighborhood.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">Paul’s clients were 
        business friends but they were not social friends, and he wondered if 
        there were any reason why he could not make social friends of his 
        business friends, at least of some of them. He conceived of a group of 
        business men banded together socially; then he thought that there would 
        be an especial advantage in each member having exclusive representation 
        of his particular trade or profession. The members would be mutually 
        helpful.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">He resolved to organize 
        such a club. Who should be asked to join? Of one thing he was 
        certain—they must be friendly men. He thought of his client, Silvester 
        Schiele, the coal man, and Gustavus Loehr, mining engineer, and then he 
        thought of Harry Ruggles, a printer who had been supplying the needs of 
        his office. All these were approachable, friendly men. Then he thought 
        of others who did not seem to pass the test.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">He talked matters over with 
        Schiele and also with Gus. [In 1938, 9 years before Paul Harris died; 
        Schiele wrote an article in The Rotarian about his early conversations 
        regarding Paul's ideas] He liked them both and thought they would like 
        each other, and on the first convenient occasion he introduced them. 
        They did like each other. There was much in the past lives of the two 
        men to justify the belief that they would understand each other and 
        enjoy each other’s companionship. Both had come to Chicago from small 
        communities, Silvester from Clay City, Indiana, and Gus from 
        Carlinville, Illinois. Both were of German parentage and each had worked 
        his way unaided to the establishment of a profitable business in a great 
        city. </font> </p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">On the night of February 
        23, 1905, the first meeting took place at Gus’ office in the Unity 
        Building. Silvester and Paul had dined together at an Italian restaurant 
        on Chicago’s near north side. Gus, by prearrangement, had invited a 
        personal friend, Hiram Shorey, a merchant tailor, a native of the 
        village of Litchfield, in the State of Maine, to whom he had previously 
        introduced Paul. The meeting was enlivened by the relation of personal 
        experiences, after which Paul unfolded the general purposes of his plan.
        </font>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">The significant occurrence 
        of the second meeting was the introduction of Harry Ruggles, the 
        printer. Harry was destined to play an important part in the life of the 
        Chicago club, for through his suggestion of club singing his influence 
        has been made felt by the entire movement.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">The spirit of the early 
        days of Rotary has frequently been described as selfish. There were 
        certainly many indications to justify the description. The literature of 
        the period, most of which was the work of Paul, emphasized the business 
        advantage of membership. Prospective members were frequently appealed to 
        directly on the basis of business gain. But even here is a distinction, 
        subtle though it may seem. The prevailing thought was to give—not to 
        receive. Giving was more reconcilable with the other thing that went 
        along with it—friendship.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">The net result was that 
        those who came into the club for the sole purpose of getting as much as 
        they could out of it were disappointed and dropped out.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">It is true that some 
        actually have realized substantial business benefits from their 
        membership in Rotary, but that may be said of the members of almost any 
        other club. Many have realized no business benefits whatever, and the 
        one class is as well satisfied as the other. Viewed from a financial 
        standpoint Rotary has been a liability to Paul, not an asset. Few would 
        contend that the spirit of the Rotary of today is selfish. No more was 
        it selfish in the first year of the movement. The lure of Rotary has 
        ever been the friendships that have been found there. By none has 
        friendship been more highly valued than by the first group who gathered 
        together in the year of our Lord, 1905.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></td>

        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">During the course of one of 
        the early meetings, Paul suggested several possible names for the new 
        club. Among others—Rotary. It met with general favor and was adopted 
        forthwith. The significance of the name be comes apparent on examination 
        of the original plan of the club, which provided for rotation in the 
        place of meeting, in the chairmanship, and even in membership which was 
        to be continued for one year only. The last named provision was an 
        expedient to insure attendance, it being thought that sustained interest 
        in attention to club duties would be assured if continued membership 
        were made to depend upon re-election. Members were fined 50 cents for 
        failure to attend meetings, and no excuses were given consideration. The 
        proceeds of the fines imposed paid all expenses of running the club.&quot;

        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">&quot;There was Silvester, a 
        coal dealer, our first president; he was of German parentage. His was a 
        kindly nature and his face was wont to light up with pleasure on meeting 
        friends.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">He told interesting stories 
        of his boyhood home on an Indiana farm, revealing the picture of a log 
        cabin and family group around the fireplace. He told of the hardships of 
        early life; for example, of the snow that used to pelt through the 
        chinks in the roof of the attic in which he slept, forming miniature 
        drifts upon the floor. He treasured the memory of early days. Though his 
        life in Chicago had been a struggle, he had managed to be helpful to the 
        younger members of his family.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">He had responded to his 
        country’s call in its time of need, serving in Cuba during the 
        Spanish-American war. Clearly he was eligible. Succeeding years have 
        demonstrated the wisdom of the selection; Silvester fills a worthy 
        place, and his life becomes increasingly useful with advancing years. He 
        is the center of community activities and church work, the key man in 
        charitable undertakings. Many young men have him to thank for years of 
        wise counsel. Many crippled children have him to thank for physical 
        rehabilitation. To Silvester every human need is a command. His 
        telephone rings night and day, but he is never too tired to respond 
        although his health is not always the best, and he is very tired at 
        times. During the early days of the depression, and until the charities 
        in his part of the city were put on an organized basis, Silvester’s 
        office was made to serve as a clearing-house, and many hundred needy 
        were given relief.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">There was another of German 
        parentage; Gustavus, a promoter. His personality challenged attention. 
        His was a rare combination, the good in him easily outweighing the bad. 
        He was a stormy petrel, vehement, impetuous, imperative, domineering, in 
        one breath; then calm, docile, and lovable in the next. He was always 
        thought compelling; his words were spoken with lightning like rapidity, 
        and with such force that men frequently stopped in the street to look at 
        him. His educational advantages had been limited, but his English was 
        classical.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">Where he found the 
        vocabulary with which to give his furious thoughts expression, was a 
        quandary. Gus’ membership was of brief duration. The feverish ups and 
        downs of business resulted first in his resignation from membership, and 
        a few years later in his death. Requiescat in pace. Dear Gus, you rested 
        little while here.</font></p>

        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">Hiram, a merchant tailor 
        who hailed from the state of Maine, was of the number. He was an 
        agreeable fellow. He had never quite reconciled himself to life in a 
        large city; in fact, through all the years his thoughts have constantly 
        reverted to the state of his nativity. There he spends his summer 
        vacations, and to the rock-ribbed state of Maine he will eventually 
        return to spend his remaining days.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-top: -1; margin-bottom: -1">
        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">Hiram, due to circumstances 
        beyond his control, did not retain his membership in the club, though he 
        has frequently manifested interest in the movement and shown that he 
        cherishes the memory of the early days.</font></p>

        writer constituted the first group to foregather in the fellowship of 
        Rotary. They were the vanguard of a mighty host, but to mention the four 
        without including the fifth — would be to do an injustice.</font></p>

        <font size="2" face="georgia,Times New Roman,Times">Harry, a printer, was 
        number five. He measured up to every requirement, insofar as his 
        business habits were concerned; he was reliable, punctual, and 
        straight-forward; dishonesty was to him incomprehensible. The only 
        question in the minds of the others was, “How does he stand in point of 
        fellowship?” He seemed cold, unemotional, and inexperienced in the ways 
        of men. Harry had been raised on a farm in northern Michigan. His father 
        had been an upright and religious man, whose weakness had been his 
        childish faith in all mankind. As a consequence, his cupboard was so 
        frequently bare that the belief that man was created for the purpose of 
        waging merciless war’ fare against poverty was deeply embedded in young 
        Harry’s mind.&quot; </font> </p>
