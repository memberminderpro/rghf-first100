	discovering that Paul Harris had a capacity to push the envelope and 
	frustrate even those he sought to inspire.  According to RC of 
	Chicago's "<b><a href="../../clubs/rotaryone/golden.htm">The Golden Strand</a>," 
	Harris was not the unanimous choice to head the first national organization. 
	Some felt him too autocratic. However he did lead Rotary for its first two 
	years, and then suffered a <b>
			<a href="../../presidents/1910harris/paulharris/health.html">near fatal heart 
	attack</a></b>.
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Then followed a year of recover, then years of daily attention to Rotary, 
	but few appearances at conventions, save a big surprise as RI President 
	Eugene Newsome was about to announce, with regret that the founder would not 
	be present and that the secretary would, as was customary, read his 
	statement. Paul Harris, then suddenly appeared on the floor of the
    <b><a target="_top" target="_top" href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/conventions/1930/">25th anniversary convention</a></b> of Rotary, in Chicago, and spoke a few

	was amazing as just two years earlier he had again nearly died from another 
	serious heart attack. As noted in James Walsh's biography "<b><a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/library/walsh">The 
	First Rotarian,"</a></b> it took two years to recover this time. At this 
	point Harris was also unable to carry on with his law practice. Yet,  
	he and jean had 17 years remaining, and an entire world that they would 
	visit. The bravery and strength of this man is amazing. The volumes of 
	invaluable writing left behind is a treasure of these trips.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Suddenly, I'm reminded of the voice of Paul Harris, which you can hear at 
	rotaryfirst100.org. He is introduced, on radio, from the <b>

	friends wherever he went. However, it is true that he and some of his

	different occupations, with no restrictions as to their politics or

			<b>23 February 1905</b></a> when he and his best friend, Silvester Schiele, 
	a coal merchant, had Italian dinners at Madam Galli's famous restaurant and 
	then walked over the river to the Unity Building and up to room 711, the 
	office of mining engineer Gus Loehr. Hiram Shorey, a tailor was also there. 
	Paul told them of his idea which was accepted and on March 9th they met 
	again. Gus and Hiram were still there, but not for much longer. Paul's 
	friend Harry Ruggles, a printer and several others joined. Two weeks later 
	they met at Sylvester's coal business. And since he was the host, he became 
	the first president of what they decided should be called Rotary.

	then plays a significant role in the very early meetings. He is the printer 
	and so he creates the first "printed" wheel for Rotary. But things don't 
	always go smoothly, and on more than one occasion the Chicago "Boys" are 
	ready to quit this "fellowship" idea of Paul Harris'. There are even 
	indications, written well beneath the lines that Paul Harris might have been 
	marching to a different drummer.  Anyway, we know that when it looked 
	like the club was going to collapse, Harry would jump up and yell, "Hell 
	boys, let's sing a song." Today we recognize Harry Ruggles for introducing 
	singing into Rotary.  In fact, he saved Rotary with a song. Also, in 
	James Walsh's landmark 1979 book, "The First Rotarian" Ruggles known as the 
	"Fifth Rotarian" swore until his death that he and Paul worked on Rotary in 
	1904.<center>
