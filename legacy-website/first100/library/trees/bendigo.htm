		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">The Rotary Cub of Bendigo was 
		chartered on 30 July 1925, as the first Rotary Club to be formed outside 
		a capital city in Australia, It was the eighth Club to be established in 
		Australia. The Club was sponsored by the Rotary Club of Melbourne and 
		began with 25 charter members. The Mayor of Bendigo, Cr. E.M. Vains, was 
		a prominent advocate in the formation of the Club and became the first 
		President.<br><br>The Rotary Club of Bendigo has sponsored the Rotary 
		Clubs of Castlemaine, Echuca, Bendigo-South, Eaglehawk, 
		Bendigo-Strathdale and Bendigo-Sandhurst. In 1974 the Club sponsored the 
		Rotaract Club of Bendigo, conjointly with the Rotary Club of 
		Bendigo-South.<br><br><a href="37-02TreeDedicated.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style26" height="122" src="../../global/australia/clubs/bendigo/37-02TreeDedicated.jpg" style="float: left" width="300"></a>In 
		1937 Paul Harris dedicated a tree, in his
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/library/trees/bendigo.htm">
		Chicago garden</a> to RC of Bendigo.<br><br>Over the 78 years of its 
		existence, the Club has supported the Community of Bendigo and district 
		extensively with the sponsoring of a junior football competition; a 
		Boy’s and Girl’s Week for 3000 school children; and after care program 
		for Infantile Paralysis patients; the establishment of a Youth Camp, in 
		1948 which is an on-going project to this day; radios were installed in 
		the Anne Caudle Centre for the Aged; the Rotary Youth Exchange Program 
		has been supported since 1963; Rotary Group Study Exchange programs have 
		been supported and in 1974 the Club provided a Group Study Team Leader 
		and commenced a Rotary Art Show in 1968 which is still staged each year.<br>
		<br>Carols By Candlelight began in 1970 and continues each year; a new 
		children’s ward was sponsored at the Hospital; a floral clock was 
		presented to the City; an illuminated Fountain was installed at Lake 
		Weeroona in a combined project with the Rotary Clubs of Bendigo for the 
		75th Anniversary of Rotary International.<br><br>The Rotary Club of 
		Bendigo commenced with 25 members and in its Golden Jubilee year 1975 
		had a membership of 100 members.<br><br>A real highlight in the history 
		of the Club is that three of its Past Presidents have served as District 
		Governors. They were Rotarian Arthur L. Bolton (1936-37), Rotarian 
		Ernest F. Granger (1962-63) and Rotarian Bill Sones(1967-68). Our 
		current member Rotarian Ray Downey also served as District Governor of 
		District 9780. The Club inducted more than 40 Paul Harris Fellows during 
		past years. 1983/1984 saw the first Probus Club started by our joint 
		efforts with Bendigo South. History was made in 1992 when three women 
		members were inducted into our Club and by year 1999/2000 we had our 
		first woman as President of the Club.<br><br>The Rotary Club of Bendigo 
		has recognised many achievements in the youth field including: Rotary 
		Shield for Scouts, Rotary Cup and Pennant for Guides, School Bursaries 
		and an Award for the Outstanding Apprentice of the Year.<br><br>Our Club 
		records show strong emphasis and service to youth over many years 
		including: Netball Courts construction at Garden Gully, Student 
		Counselling and Careers Night, a Train of Knowledge, 1000 students 
		travelled by train to Melbourne to inspect various industries, provided 
		special equipment for the McDonald School for the Deaf, erected a 
		first-aid room and shelter at the Maiden Gully sports area and combined 
		with district Rotary Clubs to install state of the art play equipment at 
		Lake Weeroona.<br><br>The Club started the Bendigo Old People’s Welfare 
		Society, from which the Golden Oaks Village was commenced, built a 
		bowling green at the Home and Hospital for the Aged, organised a 
		Festival of Modern and Better Living and has financially supported many 
		hundreds of local charitable bodies and causes.<br><br>During the 1980’s 
		and 1990’s the Club has strengthened its commitment to the international 
		activities of Rotary and supported a teaching program in the Solomon 
		Islands in 1980/81, the Interplast Project and the Rotary Health Fund, 
		has been a strong supporter of ROMAC program since introduction in 1995, 
		raised $ 25,000 in 1994 for medical supplies for New Guinea residents,<br>
		<br>provided word processors for Samoa, and Club members have provided 
		voluntary labour and materials for Overseas Aid in Samoa and other 
		Pacific countries.<br><br>A working party of Club members carried out 
		improvements in remote Samoan villages in year 2000. In more recent 
		times the Club and Members have provided aid for the restitution of East 
		Timor.<br><br>The Bendigo community has been a beneficiary of strong 
		support from the Club and in 1998 our Club joined with the District 
		Clubs to build 2 homes for young single mothers. The Club has numerous 
		fund raising activities for charitable organisations through the early 
		Walkabout 26, a visit from The Flying Fruit Fly Circus in 1984/85, 
		Charity Dinner Auction, Easter Art Show, Pottery Exhibition and Sales, 
		catering at the Bendigo Swap Meet and Golf Day.<br><br>In 1994/95 and 
		1995/96 Rotary implemented the Rotary Farm Aid project and the Rotary 
		Town project to help more than 175 district farming families with weekly 
		food parcels to sustain them through a prolonged drought, the retail 
		value of the projects was in excess of $ 553,000.<br><br>This summary 
		reflects just some of the many achievements, changes and activities of 
		our Club in a condensed form, but hopefully serves to indicate a vibrant 
		Club where traditions are valued and respected, with new ideas and new 
		projects being warmly embraced, to prepare for future generations of 
		Rotarians giving “Service Above Self”.<br><br>This entire section was
