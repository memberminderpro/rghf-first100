        <td width="50%" valign="top"><style="font-size: 9pt"><font size="2">In March 1934 while on a 
        tour to Great Britain and South Africa, the Harrises spent a few days 
        holidaying in the Cotswolds at the Bull Inn at Fairford, between Oxford 
        and Gloucester. <b>Local Rotarians were unaware of their presence until 
        Paul Harris went into a bank to change some money</b>.
        <a target="_top" href="images/rooftops.jpg">
        <img alt="A view of the town rooftops" hspace="2" src="images/rooftops_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/rooftops.jpg" border="3" align="right" width="150" height="112"></a>Members 
        of the Cirencester Club visited the Bull, and one, a draper called 
        Leach, offered to drive the Harrises to see the <b>English Wallingford</b>. 
        As Paul wrote in his diary:-</font><p><font size="2">&quot;<b>I was interested in Wallingford 
        because I was brought up in 
        <a href="index.htm" style="text-decoration: none">Wallingford</a>, Vermont</b>, a beautiful little 
        village in the Green Mountains. It was a long but interesting drive 
        (about 30 miles). <a target="_top" href="images/stpeters.jpg">
        <img alt="St. Peters Church across the Thames" hspace="2" src="images/stpeters_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/stpeters.jpg" border="3" align="left" width="150" height="112"></a>On 
        arrival at the quaint little city we went at once to the <b>church</b> 
        which occupied a position on the public square. While walking about we 
        met an English gentleman of about my age. He volunteered some 
        information and being thereby encouraged, I asked him what other places 
        of special interest had best be visited. He answered, 'The 
        house of William Blackstone stands on the banks of the <b>Thames</b>. I 
        suppose you know who he was.' With high enthusiasm I said that I 
        certainly did; that his commentaries occupied an honored position in all 
        law libraries in America.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Then something happened, the reason of which I could not at the time 
        understand. Like a bolt out of a clear sky he shot out this remark; 
		</font> </p>
        <p><font size="2">'That is just like you Americans. We give you the best we have and 
        then you come around with your hands out.'</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">At a loss to find better words, I inquired with considerable 
        asperity, 'Have you ever been to America, sir?' and he said 'No'. I 
        said, 'What a pity! If you will come to Chicago, I will show you a city 
        not one tenth as old as yours. We have a population of three and one 
        half million people and we have already built four great universities.' 
        My wife's embarrassment was painful, but Leach laughed audibly and 
        ejaculated, 'Lovely, lovely!' Our guide looked at me quite seriously and 
        then astounded me again by saying, 'Did you say that you wanted to look 
        around? Come along with me. I will show you the interesting sights of 
        the town.' He was true to his word. No one, I am convinced, could have 
        done the job better.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">As Jean and I were about to leave him to have a cup of tea, he said, 
        'Come and have tea with me.' I said, 'No, please come with us.' He was 
        not to be denied and he led us out of the business section to a 
        residential district along the Thames embankment, pointing out the 
        Blackstone homestead as we passed.</font></font></td>
        <td width="50%" valign="top"><style="font-size: 9pt"><font size="2">The rain was coming down 
        copiously and I will admit that I was perplexed at the whole business. 
        What circumstances had been responsible for the sudden change of 
        demeanor of this strange person?
        </font>
        <p><font size="2">I was not quite certain that he was not intending to have us all 
        'pulled' on a charge of lese majesty or something worse.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">We eventually halted at the front door of a mansion inscribed 
        'Cromwell Lodge'. 
        <a target="_top" href="images/bboat.jpg">
        <img alt="South side of Wallingord bridge" hspace="1" src="images/bboat_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/bboat.jpg" border="3" align="right" width="150" height="112"></a>Our leader opened the door unceremoniously and 
        admitted us. We passed through the hallway and out to a garden backing 
        on the river. The view up and down across into Staffordshire (actually Oxfordshire) was of itself worth a long journey. A 
        <b>bridge</b>, part of which 
        was Norman, could be seen in the distance.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Our eccentric host then invited us into a spacious drawing room and 
        ordered tea. At this juncture a lady entered, whom our host introduced 
        as Mrs Ponking, his wife. If she was annoyed by the unexpected presence 
        of strangers, she had an admirable faculty of concealing her feelings. 
        For all I could see she was as much interested in the adventure as her 
        remarkable husband. Manifestly he had done the same thing before.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Conversation flowed freely in the warmth of the fireside and our host 
        agreed to accept a picture of my own beautiful Wallingford which I 
        promised to send him. I was in fact congratulating myself in the thought 
        that all unpleasantness was past, when suddenly Mr Ponking ejaculated: 
        'I shall never go to America.' It was somewhat startling, but I realized 
        that there was no accounting for folks and that after all it was my 
        host's privilege not to go to America.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">After I had delivered myself of this ponderous thought, conversation 
        turned into pleasant channels again. When we left his home, Mr Ponking 
        went with us, somewhat to the surprise of his good lady, but perhaps she 
        would have been even more surprised had he not surprised her. Surprises 
        were manifestly the order of the day in Mr Ponking's household. He took 
        us to a book store, bought us a book on Wallingford, disappeared then 
        re-appeared only to say, 'I shall never go to America.' Then he scudded 
        away through the rain and falling darkness into a mammoth department 
        store, the facade of which bore the legend 'Ponking and Co.' My first 
        impulse, of course, was to enter in hot pursuit of the fleeing 
        Englishman, sieze him by the collar, drag him out of his 'sanctum 
        sanctorum', ignore his protests and forcibly take him to America, but on 
        more mature consideration concluded to let him have his own way about 
        it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The Wallingford incident may seem like a fairy tale, but it is not; 
        it is true as above related.&quot;</font></p>
