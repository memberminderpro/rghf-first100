		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19"  width: 50%>The Rotarians of the 
		37th District (now District 7870) voted to take an option on the 
		property known as the Old Chapel Building, erected in 1818 by James 
		Rustin the great-grandfather of Paul Harris. A committee of eight 
		members- Herman W. Vaughn Rutland, Vt.; John C. Fox, Rutland, Vt.; 
		Thomas C. Cheney, Morrisville, Vt.; Hon. John E. Weeks, Middlebury, Vt.; 
		Leandor Parkhurst, Concord, N.H.; R. A. McKelvey, Whitefield, N.H.; 
		Rowland B. Jacobs, Lebanon, N.H.; and Rev. Walter Thorpe, Brandon, Vt. 
		were appointed to organize a permanent organization to purchase, hold 
		and control the property in Wallingford, Vermont. This committee became 
		the first trustees of the Paul P. Harris Testimonial, Inc.. The building 
		and lands were purchased in two deeds in 1928. The first deed from the 
		First Congregational Church was dated August 17, 1928 and recorded in 
		the Land Records of the Town of Wallingford, Vt. in Book 23, at Page 519 
		and the second deed Nellie and Henry B. Adams, husband and wife, and 
		Harry B. Townsend recorded in said Land Records in Book 23, at Page 532, 
		on December 14, 1928.<br><br>On September 5th 1928 The Paul P. Harris 
		Testimonial, Inc. was legally organized for the following purposes among 
		others:<br><br>To establish and maintain in said Wallingford, reading 
		and writing rooms, libraries, museums, archives, antheneums, places of 
		meeting and assembly, education and entertainment, rest and recreation; 
		To collect and receive, accept and administer for altruistic and 
		charitable purposes alone any and all funds, money, securities, property<br>
		and estates subscribed, donated, given, granted, devised, bequeathed or 
		otherwise devoted to the TESTIMONIAL to Paul P. Harris as the founder of 
		Rotary International which is the principal object of this corporation.<br>
		<br>In addition to the foregoing ideas and to make the project exemplify 
		the spirit of Rotary it is proposed to expand the original plan to 
		include a trade school for boys.<br><br>An old fashioned lantern, in the 
		hands of an old man, has become the symbol in our eyes of the light that 
		guided Paul Harris. Thus the light placed over the entrance was placed 
		as a beacon light to many a lad in his upward climb to life and light 
		and useful service among men.<br><br>The deed from the Paul P. Harris 
		Testimonial, Inc. to the Officers of the Wallingford Rotary Club (Guido 
		S. Malcarne, Donald E. Mead, and William B. McLaughlin) dated August 29, 
		1947 in the Town of Wallingford, Vt. Land Records in Book 27 at Page 
		472.<br><br>February 13, 1953 a letter was mailed to Rotary 
		International requesting an annual allotment for the maintenance of the 
		Paul P. Harris Building or if this was impossible for Rotary 
		International to furnish advice relative to a plan of endowment that 
		would insure the preservation of the Building.<br><br>On May 11, 1953 
		the Wallingford Rotary Club received word that the Board of Directors 
		for R. I. had rejected the requests made by the club.<br><br>On February 
		6, 1956 the Wallingford, Vermont Club voted to contact the Wallingford 
		Selectmen in regard to disposal of the Rotary Building. It was discussed 
		with the Selectmen that the club was having financial difficulty 
		operating and maintaining the building. At the conclusion of the meeting 
		the members of the club were to contact the Selectmen at a later date to 
		further discuss the building. No further reference can be found about 
		this matter, as far as what transpired.<br><br>The District Trustees for 
		the Paul P. Harris Testimonial, Inc. had not functioned properly, as 
		they had not held an annual meeting or elected officers for many years, 
		so the membership of the Paul P. Harris Testimonial, Incorporated 
		petitioned the Superior Court in Rutland, Vermont on August 1, 1960 for 
		an order authorizing the holding of an annual meeting of the said Paul 
		P. Harris Testimonial, Incorporated at the Wallingford Rotary Club 
		building in the Town of Wallingford, County of Rutland and State of 
		Vermont at a future date at 7:30 P.M. EDT, for the transaction of the 
		following business:<br><br>Election of Officers of the Corporation.<br>
		<br>2. Amendment of the Articles of Association of the Corporation by 
		deleting from said Articles of Association the provision thereof 
		relating to membership and substituting in lieu thereof the following 
		provision relating to membership:<br><br>The Membership of the Paul P. 
		Harris Testimonial, Incorporated shall consist of all members of the 
		Wallingford Rotary Club, Wallingford, Vermont whose membership in said 
		Rotary Club is certified to by the Secretary of said Club.<br><br>3. To 
		transact such other business as is necessary and proper.<br><br>The 
		meeting warning was posted in the Rutland Herald and subsequently held 
		in Wallingford, Vermont on December 16, 1963 at 7:45 P.M. and the 
		Articles of Association were amended per the notice by the 16 members 
		present who were members of the Testimonial.<br><br>Now as of July 1st 
		each year the Officers and Directors of the Wallingford Club become the 
		Officers and Directors of the Corporation.<br><br>Talks about financial 
		support of the building commenced with Robert A. Manchester II, 
		President of Rotary International on December 3, 1976 about financial 
		support of the building. At a special meeting of the Paul P. Harris 
		Testimonial, Inc. held December 20, 1976 a motion was made by Chester B. 
		Eaton, Jr. and seconded by Irving Smith and passed unanimously:<br><br>
		Moved that the Paul P. Harris Testimonial, Inc. petition Rotary 
		International for full financial support for the maintenance, upkeep and 
		operation of the Paul Harris Memorial Building, Wallingford, Vermont. 
		The Paul P. Harris Testimonial, Inc. will maintain title to the property 
		and will supervise use of the property in the furtherance of the ideals 
		of Rotary.<br><br>

		Board of Directors of Rotary International, at its February 1977 meeting 
		considered this Resolution and agreed it will give favorable 
		consideration to this proposal that Rotary International undertake 
		financial support of the building subject to Rotary International 
		obtaining clear title to and having control over the operation of the 
		memorial building.<br><br>At the annual meeting of the Paul P. Harris 
		Testimonial, Inc. held in Wallingford, Vermont on April 18, 1977 the 
		following resolution was passed:<br><br>Be it hereby resolved that the 
		Paul P. Harris Testimonial, Inc. will consider granting clear and free 
		title to the Paul P. Harris Memorial Building in Wallingford, Vermont to 
		Rotary International provided that suitable arrangements can be 
		concluded that guarantee continued perpetual use of the building by the 
		Rotary Club of Wallingford, Vermont.<br><br>Upon receipt of this 
		resolution Rotary International agreed to support the building by paying 
		for any difference in the income versus expense in the operating budget 
		up to $3,000 annually, which was later raised to $4,000.<br><br>The club 
		and District Building Committee have been working on attaining a clear 
		title to the building through a series of volunteer lawyers, who were 
		not productive.<br><br>The deed from the Paul P. Harris Testimonial, 
		Inc. to the Officers of the Wallingford Club had three conditions and 
		must be followed:<br><br>The Grantees herein are to hold title as 
		Trustees for the Wallingford Rotary Club and for the sole use and 
		benefit of said Wallingford Rotary Club.<br><br>The lands and premises 
		described and conveyed herein are not to be used or devoted to any 
		purpose for personal profit or gain, but are to be used solely in 
		furtherance of the purposes for which they have already been used by the 
		Grantor herein and in commemoration of the late Paul P, Harris.<br><br>
		In the event that any of the conditions herein are broken or in the 
		event that the Charter of the Wallingford Rotary Club shall expire, then 
		and either event title shall pass to the Town of Wallingford, Vermont, 
		provided the said Town of Wallingford accepts the same, upon the 
		condition that the lands and premises shall be used solely in 
		commemoration of the late Paul P. Harris and not for any purpose for 
		profit or gain; and in the event that said Town of Wallingford refuses 
		to accept these lands and premises upon said conditions, then and in 
		that event the Title shall revert to the Grantor.<br><br>On January 5, 
		1998 the Town of Wallingford, Vermont Select Board voted to give up all 
		rights to the Rotary Building per condition 3 of the deed. The vote was 
		3 for, 1 against, 1 abstain. This can be found in Misc. Book 11 Page 271

		Foundation Rotary Global History Fellowship made a grant of $3,800<br>
		<br>The Little Red Schoolhouse<br>Editor: Swinford, Rachel<br>Posted on 
		Aug 25 2009<br><br>The &quot;Little Red Schoolhouse&quot; in Wallingford, Vermont 
		was built by the great-grandfather of Rotary International Founder, Paul 
		P. Harris and is a living memorial to the ideal of &quot;Service Above Self.&quot; 
		It was in this &quot;little Vermont Valley&quot; that the idea of Rotary first 
		began. Nurtured by his grandparents' and neighbors' honesty, faith and 
		goodwill towards their fellow man, Paul set forth to make his mark. He 
		never forgot his Vermont roots and they are as much a part of Rotary 
		today as they were in that Chicago office in 1905.<br><br>We are honored 
		to have The Schoolhouse in District 7870. It is owned by the Rotary 
		International District 7870 Foundation and maintained lovingly by the 
		Wallingford Memorial Rotary Club. It contains banners from clubs on 
		every continent and the oceans as well. As you enter, look at the left 
		wall about two-thirds of the way down. You will see the banner of the 
		Rotary Club that met aboard the S.S. France. The building is also full 
		of Rotary memorabilia, historic documents and a bust of Paul Harris.<br>
		<br>The &quot;Changing of the Gavel&quot; between the outgoing and incoming 
		District 7870 Governors is held at the Schoolhouse during the last week 
		of June each year. The Little Red Schoolhouse is open to all Rotarians 
		and other visitors at the club's weekly meeting on Mondays at 7:00 a.m. 
		and at other times by advance notice to the club's officers.<br><br>
		Rotarians everywhere should be grateful for all Wallingford Rotarians, 
		living and deceased. They have dedicated innumerable hours and funds to 
		the preservation of our Rotary heritage which we believe truly began 
		right here in Wallingford Vermont.</td>
