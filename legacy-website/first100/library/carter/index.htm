		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19" colspan="3">The text of Carter's 
		Final Tribute to Harris<br><br>Almost on the very day on which the 
		foregoing pages were being passed to the printers came the news on the 
		morning radio bulletin that Paul Harris, Founder of Rotary, had passed 
		away in his 79th year. Some remarks additional to those very briefly 
		made in Chapter I may not be out of place from the author, who may claim 
		to have enjoyed, during his almost yearly visits to Chicago as Secretary 
		of R.I.B.I., and his residence there as Editor of The Rotarian, a very 
		intimate relationship with a personality around whom a certain mystery 
		persists in clinging, which, as the years go on, will inevitably shape 
		into a myth.<br><br>About the man himself, I never met a celebrity less 
		conscious of being one, or less concerned to live up to the tradition 
		woven around him. Paul, and his charming, fresh&#8209;complexioned, smiling 
		Scottish wife, lived at Morgan Park, a wooded outskirt fourteen miles 
		southwest of Chicago and far from its madding crowds. Like the homes of 
		so many other founders of great movements, that of Paul and Mrs. Harris 
		was of the simplest, most tasteful and comfortable that could be 
		desired. A fancy of his was to sit in a dark comer and listen, and talk 
		&#8209; when drawn out &#8209; slowly, deliberately and reservedly on almost any 
		topic raised. His philosophy &#8209; strange as it may seem to those who 
		associate Rotary with flamboyance and exuberant optimism &#8209; was that of a 
		sceptic, and I never succeeded in extracting from him an exact statement 
		of his religious faith.<br><br>He gave no encouragement whatever to 
		suggestions, freely made in the twenties, on both sides of the Atlantic, 
		that Rotary was a &quot;spiritual&quot; movement in some way linked up with the 
		churches. No man was fonder of a joke, or fuller of amusing 
		recollections, and his memories of Rotary were memories of an infinite 
		number of personal friends. If Chicago still deserves its reputation for 
		&quot;hustle,&quot; none of its citizens lived up to it less than the founder of 
		Rotary, whose movements, like his speech, were slow, quiet, and 
		unobtrusive. Though one could place him more easily in an old&#8209;world 
		English village than the mid&#8209;western American metropolis, Paul Harris 
		was immensely proud of Chicago and its phenomenal growth during his long 
		lifetime, and would not stand for slighting remarks at its expense. The 
		suggestion that Rotary might move its home elsewhere was not one he 
		favoured, and it has not been carried out in his lifetime, anyway. 
		Personally I hope it will not be; for if Rotary is a good thing, why 
		transplant it from its place of origin?<br><br>Of Paul Harris, there is 
		one outstanding thing to be said; he never forgot a friend, never failed 
		to respond to a request for help or advice. He put himself to endless 
		pains to help the visitor, especially if it had to do with finding 
		opportunities for service or a house-room in Chicago. He was generous to 
		a fault with letters of introduction, and wrote them in his own 
		handwriting.<br><br>As to the perennial question touched on the first 
		chapter of the book, the true origin of Rotary, and whether its Founder 
		ever foresaw its world&#8209;wide development, he admitted frankly that it was 
		primarily a fellowship that he conceived the original club.<br><br>“I 
		was always a great lover of fun,” he said, “and got an ecstatic joy out 
		of contacts with others. But such things were spontaneous and not part 
		of my serious purpose with Rotary. My sense of the ethical possibilities 
		began to develop early in my experience of fellowship and the fun of the 
		thing, in which I reveled. I numbered among my intimate friends Arthur 
		Sheldon, founder of the School of Business Science, one of the earliest 
		to propagate that Service must be the foundation of all true success in 
		business, and I was influenced by him to some extent. I very soon began 
		to realise that, in the Rotary organisation, we could paint the picture 
		that existed so far only in a sketch.&quot;<br><br>Nothing can rob Paul 
		Harris of the credit for the geographical extension of Rotary, for he it 
		was, beyond a doubt, who formed the clubs on the Pacific Coast that were 
		the first to follow Chicago. As is briefly recorded in the book, it was 
		in that more critical atmosphere that the early crudities of the 
		movement were rounded off, and its latent ethical purposes gradually 
		evolved that ultimately became paramount. As Harris put it in the same 
		conversation:<br><br>&quot;When it was made known to the world that Rotary 
		was an ethical movement, the true significance of the classification 
		system was realised as it had not been before. We had made a piece of 
		machinery of which we had not foreseen what would be the ultimate use. 
		When we saw it, that the classified man in Rotary should be the 
		interpreter of the ideal of service above self in business and 
		profession, we sought to widen our area in every direction, to get as 
		many clubs as we could organise. When the clubs began to be formed in 
		other countries, then it was seen we had yet a greater mission &#8209; as 
		between nation and nation, people and people, and so it is now 
		developing.&quot;<br><br>Of late years Paul Harris had been somewhat of a 
		shadowy figure in Rotary, delivering regularly every year a &quot;Message&quot; to 
		the Convention, through a spokesman, and on occasion only appearing in 
		person. He visited Europe once or twice, and never enjoyed anything 
		more, I believe, than his quiet rambles in rural England, and especially 
		Dickens's England &#8209;and London. For one reason only am I consoled that he 
		passed away before paying our city a revisit, and that is because it 
		would surely have broken his heart to see the Temple and some of the 
		Inns in which he, as a lawyer, loved to wander and to meditate, the heap 
		of rubble they are today.<br><br>It is to be hoped that the memory of 
		this simple, lovable man, who &quot;showed himself friendly&quot; to all with whom 
		he came into contact, will be fittingly honoured by the movement he 
		founded that men the wide world over may spread his ideals of fellowship 
		and service among all the nations, and that London will not fail to play 
		her full part in that tribute. <br><br>Text scanned by
