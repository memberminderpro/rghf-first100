				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 26.5pt; color: #767676">What Rotary is<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">The reconstruction 
				period following the second world war saw Rotarians and Rotary 
				clubs all over the world contributing generously to relief 
				activities. They sent clothing, books, food packages, and many 
				other things to people living in war-devastated areas.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">The recipient of 
				one such package wrote a &quot;thank-you&quot; note to the donor he had 
				never seen. After expressing grati­tude for the relief from 
				extreme circumstances, he asked, &quot;Are you by any chance a member 
				of a club that believes 'he profits most who serves best'?&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">This concept, in 
				many different forms, is at the root of any definition of 
				Rotary. Ask any member in any com­munity the question: &quot;What 
				does Rotary mean to your community?&quot; and you will get a variety 
				of answers. One may say, &quot;Rotary has helped to make our 
				community a more friendly place in which to live.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">Another may reply, 
				&quot;It has helped obliterate community factions by providing a 
				common meeting ground.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">Still another: &quot;It 
				has strengthened our civic organiza­tions through its facility 
				for unselfish co-operation.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">A fourth: &quot;Rotary 
				in my town has provided training ground for constructive 
				leadership—an invaluable asset to any community.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">And one more: &quot;I 
				feel that Rotary has linked my city with other cities and towns 
				all over the world. With so many friends in so many places, life 
				seems sweeter and more enjoyable—and safer.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">In other words, 
				Rotary is many things to many people. Technically, Rotary is an 
				organization of local clubs unified through a larger grouping 
				called &quot;Rotary International.&quot; The individual—the heart of 
				Rotary—is a member of the local club; the club is the member of 
				Rotary International.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">Technically, too, 
				a Rotary club is an association of representative business and 
				professional men of the commu­nity who have accepted the ideal 
				of service as the real basis for attaining success and happiness 
				in personal, business, and community life. And the ideal of 
				service? In general, it is an attitude that relates persons and 
				things with action—constructive action; thoughtfulness of others 
				is the basis of this service, and helpfulness to others is its 
				expression.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">Rotary also has 
				been called &quot;an ideal in action&quot; and &quot;friendship organized.&quot; 
				Translated into deed, it is thoughtful action, quick response to 
				need, and the giving of the most valuable possession of any 
				man—himself. In the beginning, Rotary came from a lonely man's 
				hunger for friendship and fellowship. The first meeting of 
				&quot;Rotarians&quot; was held in the name of acquaintance, but that 
				acquaintance was designed to lead to increased business for each 
				man. The meaning of Rotary, however, grew as the men grew, and 
				the new organization expanded and deepened its challenge. Rotary 
				became a spirit of service which men took into the market place, 
				or into the office, or to whatever point they struggled to 
				create order where there had been chaos, beauty where there had 
				been ugliness, and fellowship where there had been loneliness 
				and misunderstanding.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">At no point in its 
				development have men been able to say: &quot;This is Rotary. This is 
				the place where we can stop, and the world can move on.&quot; For the 
				world does move on, and Rotary moves with the men who move the 
				world. More than 30 years after Rotary's beginning, when lesser 
				men might have thought in terms of solidifying the stream of 
				progress, Paul Harris, the founder, wrote: &quot;This is a changing 
				world; we must be prepared to change with it. The story of 
				Rotary will have to be written again and again.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">The story's 
				setting has been more than half of the terrible and magnificent 
				twentieth century, the century when man probed the atom and 
				found there the power to destroy himself. It is the century of 
				more material progress than in all the rest of man's time put 
				together. It is the century in which man pushed back the 
				frontiers of Outer Space while at the same moment he was 
				confounded by the gaps of mis­understanding and selfishness 
				within the &quot;inner space&quot; of mankind. In spite of this lag, 
				however, it is the century in which individualism ascended to a 
				very high place, a century in which increasing numbers of men 
				found ways to fulfill a sense of personal success.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">Out of such a 
				social context came Rotary. And Rotarians have been so deeply 
				concerned with the deeper meaning of what they have created that 
				they have pondered it and debated it in convention. A part of 
				one resolution, adopted many years ago, is appropriate here for 
				the light it sheds on the definition of Rotary:</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 9.5pt; color: black">. . . 
				Fundamentally, Rotary undertakes to reconcile the ever present 
				conflict between the desire to profit for oneself and the duty 
				and consequent impulse to serve others. This philosophy is the 
				philosophy of service—'service above self— and is based on the 
				practical ethical principle that 'he profits most who serves 
				best.'</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 9.5pt; color: black">Primarily a Rotary 
				club is a group of representative business and professional men 
				who . . . have accepted the Rotary philosophy of service and are 
				seeking: first, to study collectively the theory of service as 
				the true basis of success and happiness in business and in life; 
				and second, to give, collectively, practical demonstrations of 
				it to themselves and their community; and third, each as an 
				individual, to translate its theory into practice in his 
				business and in his everyday life; and fourth, individually and 
				collectively, by active precept and example, to stimulate its 
				acceptance both in theory and practice by all non-Rotarians as 
				well as by all Rotarians . . .</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 9.5pt; color: black">Because he who 
				serves must act, Rotary is not merely a state of mind, nor 
				Rotary philosophy merely subjective, but must translate itself 
				into objective activity; and the individual Rotarian and the 
				Rotary club must put the theory of service into practice . . .<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><i>
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">He who serves must 
				act </span></i><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">. . 
				. for service is not a state of mind—as necessary as is the 
				proper state of mind. Voluntary service implies <i>freedom, </i>
				to act, too. Amidst gathering war clouds in 1940, the 
				international convention at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">
				Havana</st1:City>,
 <st1:country-region w:st="on">Cuba</st1:country-region></st1:place>, adopted a 
				resolution which said, in part: &quot;. . . Rotary is based on the 
				ideal of service, and where freedom, justice, truth, sanctity of 
				the pledged word, and respect for human rights do not exist, 
				Rotary can not live, nor its ideal prevail.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">Rotary is not a 
				substitute for any other organization; it </span>
				<span style="font-size: 10.5pt; color: black">flourishes only 
				where other free institutions are strong. The ideal of service 
				is put into practice by each Rotarian who, as a resolution of 
				another convention put it, is &quot;a loyal member&quot; of his church or 
				religion and &quot;a loyal and serving citizen of his own country.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 10.5pt; color: black">What is Rotary?</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 10.5pt; color: black">It is the 
				experience of men of different faiths and different opinions and 
				different nationalities growing in fellowship wherever they may 
				be. It is men discovering their responsibilities toward one 
				another and finding them­selves in purposeful action.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 10.5pt; color: black">Rotary may be—and 
				is—a man in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
				pondering the destruction of uncontrolled water and initiating a 
				pro­gram to conserve the precious soil. It may be—and is—a 
				school for underprivileged children in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">
				Sao Paulo</st1:City>, <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Brazil</st1:country-region></st1:place>; a hospital in Indiana, <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:place></st1:country-region>, where 
				children can go to re</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">pair 
				the ravages of the great child cripplers. It may be— and is—a 
				school for deaf and mute children on the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
				island</st1:PlaceType>
 			   of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Cyprus</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>. 
				It may be—and is—a remote village in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
				struggling upward with the help of its &quot;foster parents,&quot; a 
				Rotary club. It may be—and is—a Rotary-sponsored student wending 
				his way from his home to a university across the seas.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">Many men have 
				tried to define Rotary, but Sir Harry Lauder, the famous 
				Scottish folksong- and ballad-singer, drew a picture definition 
				with words:</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 9.5pt; color: black">I have always 
				likened Rotary to a light, and it is a great thing to have a 
				light—a beacon.—in front. I remember once I traveled all through 
				one dreary Sunday, and when in the gloamin' of the evening, 
				sitting at the window of my hotel, I saw a lamplighter come down 
				the darkening street, sticking his pole in the lamps as he 
				passed, and I thought: &quot;He is doing a great thing—he is lighting 
				up the way so that the wayfarer may walk without falling.&quot; That 
				lamplighter re­minded me of the light of Rotary. Encourage your 
				sons to be Rotarians, because some day you will pass off the 
				road of Rotary—and it will be a good thing to know that you left 
				your sons to follow the light of Rotary, and to follow it with 
				enthusiasm.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">By the very nature 
				of Rotary, every Rotarian writes his own definition; the &quot;story&quot; 
				of Rotary to which its founder referred is rewritten every time 
				a new member is welcomed into a club and every time a new Rotary 
				club is formed. No two Rotarians are alike, no two communities 
				are alike—but the pattern of service is always cut from the 
				cloth of thoughtfulness of and helpfulness to others.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">For example, the 
				Australian Rotarian mentioned previously had frequent 
				professional contacts with farmers in his community. As he 
				observed the farms, he could see the beginning of soil erosion. 
				He could see the rivers which once ran clear carrying a heavy 
				load of silt—rich soil washed off the upper reaches when the 
				plows stripped off natural cover. He could see gullies forming 
				in the wake of recurring floods.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">This Rotarian took 
				his special knowledge—and his concern—to his club. The club, in 
				turn, embarked upon a project of making a motion picture about 
				soil conservation—a film to be promoted for public showing.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">It would not be 
				accurate to say that this one thing reversed the process of 
				erosion in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The 
				problem remains, but a man and his club, armed with specific 
				knowledge, initiated constructive action which has importance 
				far beyond the confines of a single region, since conserving the 
				soil is one of the basic concerns of mankind.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">Rotary helps to 
				make a man sensitive to need; it impels him to bring his special 
				knowledge and experience to the task and, above all, to 
				act—alone, if he can, or in company with his fellow men if this 
				is the better way. The Rotarian himself gives immediate and 
				concrete meaning to &quot;service above self&quot; and &quot;he profits most 
				who serves best.&quot; The compilers of dictionaries do not build the 
				meaning of such mottoes; nor do they dictate that Rotary should 
				be known as a &quot;service&quot; club. These concepts are made meaningful 
				by men of action, their action defining the words.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
