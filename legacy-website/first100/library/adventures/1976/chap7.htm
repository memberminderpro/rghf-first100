				<span style="font-size:26.5pt;color:black">Challenge of the 
				future</span></b></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The foreign minister of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Belgium</st1:place></st1:country-region>, Paul van Zeeland, 
				addressing the 1953 international convention in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Paris</st1:place></st1:City>, said: &quot;If the moral 
				and political sciences had kept up with the wisdom of the exact 
				sciences, if man's wisdom had been as great as his knowledge, he 
				would today be in the midst of a Golden Age . . .&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				His concluding words, however, placed what-might-have-been in 
				proper perspective and sketched a brighter blueprint for the 
				future. &quot;After all,&quot; he said, &quot;isn't it true that in any 
				conflict between opposed ideologies, the victor is, in the end, 
				the side which is inspired by the highest ideal and which 
				succeeds in carrying this ideal into action? In the long run the 
				last word always belongs to the spirit.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The world of the spirit is today's unyielding frontier; it will 
				not submit to formula nor laboratory nor assembly line. 
				Scientists can shrink the world to one geographic neighborhood, 
				but they can not make the &quot;neighbors&quot; like each other. They can 
				isolate no formulas which can be automatically applied to 
				produce respect and service and fellowship in an interdependent 
				world. They can delve in­to the atom, the building block of the 
				universe, and release its awesome power, but they can not 
				restrain the outlaw's hand who would destroy the earth.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Against the backdrop of the first half of the epochal Twentieth 
				Century, most of the spectacular headlines have been written by 
				men who indulged the selfish desires of material superiority, 
				brute strength, and narrow partisanship. Narrow causes, gnawing 
				at men's idealism, have taken their toll, but the human spirit 
				springs back eternally nurtured and inspired by the noblest 
				ideals. Rotary's appeal has been to these ideals—the selfless 
				spirit searching for the best in other men. This universal 
				spirit is searching for a way out of the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Imminent Destruction</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Is there a way?</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Rotary's founder wrote:</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.5pt;color:black">
				Rotary's program of promoting better understanding between 
				different racial groups and between devotees to different 
				religious faiths, so simply and auspiciously begun in the year 
				1905, has met with greater success thus far than the 
				negotiations of diplomats. It has been the way of Rotary to 
				focus thought upon matters in which they are in agreement, 
				rather than upon matters in which they are in disagreement. 
				Rotary has satisfactorily demonstrated the fact that friendship 
				can easily hurdle national and religious boundary lines.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				This approach represents the technique of the simple act, the 
				small man-to-man acts of service and fellowship. Is this 
				technique equal to the demands of the present and future? 
				Whether it is or not, Rotary offers no magic formula, no quick 
				solution. Its method does not make headlines.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				But it does make friends.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				A Rotarian in a small town in northern <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Sweden</st1:place></st1:country-region>
				wrote a letter across the world to another Rotarian in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">New South Wales</st1:place></st1:State>, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Both, although in the 
				same line of business, were strangers to each other. The letter 
				originated from a Rotary activity known <i>as </i>&quot;Targets for 
				Today,&quot; through which Rotarians exchange letters, slides, tapes, 
				programs—and people, too—in order to build a better 
				understanding of each other.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Among other things, the Swedish Rotarian learned that the 
				thousands of emigrants entering <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>—many 
				from war-torn lands of widely differing traditions—no longer 
				were referred to as &quot;displaced persons.&quot; They were called &quot;new 
				Australians.&quot; And what a difference!</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The Swedish Rotarian was touched by this. And both men came to 
				feel a common understanding through their exchange of letters.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				A small act? Yes, a small act, but multiply this act by a half 
				million such acts! Out of such a barrage of understanding comes 
				the destruction of such cliches as &quot;plodding Englishmen,&quot; 
				&quot;greedy Americans,&quot; &quot;hot-tempered Latins,&quot; &quot;stolid Orientals,&quot; 
				and the other labels which hamper communication between men.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The genuine approach to Rotary fellowship—the firm handclasp and 
				the warm, informal greeting—speaks in inaudible eloquence: &quot;You 
				don't pray or talk the way I do, but you're a fellow human 
				being, and I like you.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Rotary creates an atmosphere in which the natural 
				&quot;neighborliness&quot; of men can assert itself and a method by which 
				the universal hunger for fellowship can be filled. Rotary 
				influences men to oscillate, to move around the luncheon table 
				so that the circle of acquaintanceship be comes larger, to move 
				around the district and their country and the world.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				So, the Rotarian who accepts the challenge of a true ad­venture 
				in service will move in ever larger circles of fel­lowship, if 
				not in person at least in point of view. Aware of and sensitive 
				to his personal opportunities for service, he will use the 
				avenues of Rotary to widen his horizons and deepen his 
				perceptions. He will also take the long view of the world in 
				which he lives, and, ever mindful of the urgency of the hour, he 
				will move with deliberate judgment.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				If one 60-minute turn of the clock's minute hand represented 
				100,000 years of man's life on earth, the last few seconds would 
				represent man's efforts to unite with other men for mutual 
				protection and progress. Men have come a long way during these 
				last few &quot;seconds;&quot; With the grim memory of two world wars 
				haunting his mind and the likelihood of another casting a long 
				shadow across his future and his children's future, mankind must 
				realize the pressing necessity of finding a route to survival.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				There is not much promise, however, in survival alone; to return 
				to the sheltering cave is merely pushing backward the hands of 
				the clock. Twentieth Century man, conqueror of land and sea and 
				space, discoverer of the secrets of the universe, and builder of 
				temples and schools and hospitals, must build a world community 
				that will be as safe and as pleasant as the home in which he 
				rears his children.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The challenge of the future is to move faster along the four 
				avenues of Rotary service—and especially toward the goal of 
				international understanding. If there is failure here, there 
				will be no need for concern about the others.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Each Rotarian must accept his own personal challenge: to 
				strengthen club service, for this is the foundation of all 
				service; to serve and dignify his profession, and to exert 
				leadership to raise the standards of his business or profession; 
				to serve his community more effectively, so that his town or 
				city will become a better place in which to live and rear his 
				children; and to explore every possible means, with his own club 
				and in co-operation with other groups, to increase international 
				understanding—thereby hastening the time of peace and good will.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Each Rotarian must be aware of the seriousness of his own 
				personal challenge or there can be no acceptance of tomorrow's 
				challenge by Rotary as an organization. Paul Harris must have 
				had in mind each Rotarian's acceptance of his current 
				responsibilities when he wrote: &quot;The story of Rotary will have 
				to be written again and again.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Our inference must be that the story of Rotary is written again 
				each time a new member comes into a club, and each time an old 
				member personally achieves—or tries to achieve—the object of 
				Rotary.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				How well can we write the story of Rotary, today and in the 
				future? This is the challenge thrust upon every Rotarian.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				At the <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mexico City</st1:place></st1:City> convention in 
				1952 Dr. Alberto Lleras of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">
				Bogota</st1:City>,
 <st1:country-region w:st="on">Colombia</st1:country-region></st1:place>, 
				secretary of the Organization of American States, revealed part 
				of the secret of Rotary's past success and outlined the hopeful 
				shape of the future when he said:</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.5pt;color:black">
				The way in which Rotary International proceeds is very well 
				suited to its purpose. It is the open-minded approach, simple 
				and direct, like the friendly visit to a neighbor, calling on 
				all who share the desire to serve others. But the philosophy 
				implicit in this approach is that of human solidarity . . .</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:9.5pt;color:black">
				These gatherings (Rotary conventions) provide us with a glimpse 
				of humanity as we should like it to be, as it is going to be, as 
				it must be. Tolerant of the imperfections and strange ways of 
				others; determined to understand even the lowliest motives in 
				the behavior of foreigners; deaf to sectarian appeals to 
				discrimination on grounds of sex, race, religion, or accident of 
				birth, of class and party strife, with all of which fanatical 
				groups attempt to sow the seeds of irrational hatred in which 
				their cults flourish; freed from violence; chastened by 
				suffering; and ennobled by friendship.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The challenge of the future?</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				To ennoble the world by friendship—to help create a world where 
				order, service to humanity, and peace prevail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
