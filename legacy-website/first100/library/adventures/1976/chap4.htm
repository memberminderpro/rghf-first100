				<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				<span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">Chicago</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">, 
				in the early 1900's, was still a pioneer town. It was 
				assimilating every level of society that was fil­tering 
				westward. Corruption, if not accepted with grace, was accepted 
				with resignation. Respectable businessmen often wondered if they 
				could survive the circumstances surrounding them.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				A campaign for civic improvement, however, was quietly under 
				way, and this presaged a fierce battle for righteousness in 
				which businessmen were to shed their cloaks of complacency and 
				dig into the fight to give their city a right sense of 
				direction. It is conceivable that Rotary might have been born 
				under sunnier skies in a climate more equable, but there are 
				many who contend that there could have been no more favorable 
				birthplace for Rotary than in paradoxical <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>. The motto, &quot;I 
				Will,&quot; was not only engraved on <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>'s municipal shield, it was also 
				emblazoned upon the hearts of the farseeing men and women of 
				this Midwestern &quot;melting pot.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The first Rotary meeting was held in a typical business officea 
				small room, not too well lighted, with a desk and three or four 
				uncomfortable chairs, a coat rack in the corner, one or two 
				pictures and an engineering chart on the wall.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				It was the office of Gus Loehr, a mining engineer, and Gus had 
				just welcomed a visitora merchant tailor named Hiram Shorey. 
				Hiram took one of the straight-backed chairs, and he and Gus 
				began to talkfirst, casual conversation about the usual topics, 
				but their talk soon drifted to the idea which a lawyer-friend 
				had been discussing for several months. The lawyer's name was 
				Paul Harris, and he had an idea about a new kind of club. They 
				would discuss it again tonight, for Gus and Hiram were waiting 
				for two more visitorsSilvester Schiele, a coal dealer, and Paul 
				Harris himself.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Presently, these two men entered the room. They re-</span><span style="font-size:10.5pt;
color:black">marked that they had just eaten an excellent dinner at an Italian 
				restaurant, Madame Galli's. They talked about one or two amusing 
				experiences, and then Paul began to unfold his idea for a new 
				club. He explained that it would be a good thing if a group of 
				businessmen could get together periodically to get better 
				acquainted. Thus Rotary was born on <st1:date Month="2" Day="23"
Year="1905" w:st="on">23 February, 1905</st1:date>.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				From the facile brain and lonely heart of Paul Harris an idea 
				had comean idea which stimulated the imagination of the three 
				men who gathered around him. This idea, conceived as most great 
				ideasa tiny fragment of genius challenged these men to dream a 
				small dream even on that February evening. They dared not dream, 
				however, that the idea set in motion within the drab walls of 
				this <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City> office would some day enlist the minds 
				of men around the world.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Within a few days other friends and acquaintances had been drawn 
				into the circle of Gus Loehr, Hiram Shorey, Silvester Schiele, 
				and Paul Harris. The first meetings were informal, but basic 
				rules were adopted, and gradually the Rotary Club of Chicago 
				came into existence.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				As with all human things, there were mixed objectives and ideas 
				in this first Rotary group. There was spirited discussion, with 
				the admitted hope that such a grouping would help the members 
				get new business. Meetings, they decided, were to be held in 
				rotation at members' places of business; hence the name 
				&quot;Rotary.&quot; To broaden acquaintance and perhaps help obtain more 
				business, it was agreed that only one representative of each 
				business or profession would be admitted. Keenly aware of the 
				bitter business rivalry of their time, they agreed that in this 
				way there might be less chance of dissension within the new 
				club.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				There were these business aspects in the early days of Rotary, 
				but they also carried the germ of the idea that would lead the 
				fledgling group into the path of service. Schiele put it this 
				way: &quot;Each of us would he having some thought for the welfare of 
				the other fellow.&quot; It was only a step from the business welfare 
				of the fellow member to the social welfare of the community, a 
				step that was first taken in 1907 when the new club led a 
				campaign to install public comfort stations in Chicago's city 
				hallits first service project. The course of this first Rotary 
				club was firmly set.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				A description of those early members of the first years further 
				indicates the slant of the sail. Harris said of them: '&quot;They 
				were friendly and congenial, and each represented a recognized 
				and honorable vocation different from that of the others. They 
				had been selected without regard to religious, racial or 
				political differences. The group in­cluded members of American, 
				German, Swedish, and Irish ancestry, and representatives of the 
				Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish faiths, all products of the 
				American melting pot, and, in that respect, fitting progenitors 
				of the inter­national order which they were to bring into 
				being.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Those two qualitiesthe premise of agreement and the 
				unquestioning acceptance of a man as a <i>man </i>instead of as 
				a member of a specific groupbecame the flesh and blood of 
				Rotary history.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Everyone who has come to Rotary has brought some special talent, 
				some particular ability, or some new idea. Perhaps in individual 
				circumstances these have not always been utilized, but in others 
				thev have left a lasting imprint. The case of the &quot;number 5 
				Rotarian,&quot; a printer named Harry Ruggles who joined immediately 
				after the first meeting, is pertinent. Musically inclined, he is 
				credited with introducing one of the most prominent 
				characteristics of Rotary fellowship, club singing. Many clubs, 
				it is true, do not have a brief song period at the beginning of 
				their meetings; on the other hand, a majority feel that such a 
				period relaxes men tensed up by the business day, and they sing 
				with a will.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				After the new club in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>
				had held a few meetings, the members began discussing an 
				appropriate emblem, one that would symbolize the developing 
				meaning of their organization. One member submitted a design of 
				a locomotive drive wheel with a counterweight and the word 
				&quot;Rotary Club&quot; on the connecting rod. Another presented a design 
				of a buggy wheel, and this was adopted. He afterwards added 
				&quot;dust&quot; to portray the idea of motionbut put the dust both 
				before and after the wheel so it appeared to be rolling on the 
				clouds. Later a streamer carrying the words &quot;Rotary Club&quot; was 
				added to this design.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				All the early emblems varied considerably, although most used 
				the wheel in one way or another. Differing elements often were 
				superimposed, some symbolic of the club or region, others of a 
				characteristic product. The 1912 convention adopted the gear 
				wheel as the basic design, and subsequently there were minor 
				changes until, in 1922, authority was given to &quot;create, adopt, 
				and preserve&quot; an emblem. Accordingly, the present gear wheel 
				with 24 cogs, six spokes, and a keyway was adopted.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				No official meaning attaches to the design. It simply is a 
				device worn to proclaim the wearer's identity with Rotary. But 
				in the deeper sense, the wheel carries significant meaning. 
				Modern society could not exist without all the many forms of 
				gear wheels; they are the mechanisms of driving force, of 
				transmitting power, of work. The choice of it by the early 
				Rotarians was significant, for it symbolized the aspirations 
				they held for their budding organization.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Those aspirations were developed further when, in 1908, another 
				event occurred to exemplify the influence of a man on an 
				organization. Rotary history is replete with such instances, 
				right from the very start. And one of the first came in 1908, 
				when Ruggles introduced a prospective member to the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City> cluban enterprising young man from 
				the staff of the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>
				public library, a night school teacher, and a former officer in 
				the United States Army during the Spanish-American war. His name 
				was Chesley R. Perry.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The case of &quot;Ches&quot; Perry was of the pattern. He em­braced Rotary 
				cautiously, then wholeheartedly, and he contributed greatly. At 
				the first national convention, in 1910, Harris was elected 
				president and Perry the first secretary, <i>a </i>post he held 
				through various changes in nomenclature and organizational 
				developmentsmany of which bore his unmistakable stampuntil his 
				retirement in 1942 </span>
				<span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">at the age of 70. A 
				high moment of his career came at the 1954 international 
				convention in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Seattle</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">
				Washington</st1:State>,
 <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:country-region></st1:place>, when the 
				delegates assembled demonstrated their deep affection by 
				offering him the post of secretary emeri­tus. He declined with 
				evident emotion in order that he might remain &quot;just one of the 
				members&quot; of his Rotary club.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Of this man, who died in February, 1960, Paul Harris said, &quot;If I 
				can in truth be called the architect, Ches can with equal truth 
				be called the builder of Rotary International,&quot; a testimony 
				untarnished by the years. He created, for example, the 
				secretariat, the central servicing organization of Rotary; he 
				initiated publication of the magazine which plays so large a 
				part in Rotary; the list of his contributions touches virtually 
				every facet.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Rotary, of course, grew as it developed its patterns. The second 
				club was formed in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">San Francisco</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">
				California</st1:State>,
 <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:country-region></st1:place>, a long 
				jump from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>, 
				in 1908. It was followed early the next year by a club across 
				the bay in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Oak­land</st1:place></st1:City>, and by August, 
				1910, there were 16 clubs dotted across the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. They called the first 
				convention in August, 1910, in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>
				to organize &quot;The National Association of Rotary Clubs.&quot; 
				Approximately 1500 members attended. Two years later at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">
				Duluth</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Minnesota</st1:State>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">
				U.S.A.</st1:country-region></st1:place>, 50 clubs were 
				represented and with the presence of delegates from <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Winnipeg</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Manitoba</st1:State>,
 <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region></st1:place>, the 
				organization had become international.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				In addition to growing in numbers Rotarians began to contribute 
				significantly to the intangible world of human relations, where 
				occurs the fascinating parade of men of vision moving upward in 
				defining their ideals. At the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Buffalo</st1:place></st1:City> convention in 1913 the stage was set 
				for considera­tion of a &quot;Rotary Code of Ethics.&quot; President 
				Russell F. Greiner appointed a committee to discuss the matter; 
				one member was from <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Sioux City</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Iowa</st1:State>,
 <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:country-region></st1:place>, and he 
				sought the help of members of his club. Most of the work was 
				done in <st1:place
w:st="on">Pullman</st1:place> cars traveling to the next convention in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Houston</st1:place></st1:City>, but these men 
				drafted the first copy of a '&quot;code of trade ethics.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				This was to have important repercussions. The code passed 
				through the crucibles of both the
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Houston</st1:place></st1:City> and <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">San Francisco</st1:place></st1:City>
				conventions; its adoption marked the definite turning point in 
				Rotary from the &quot;business reciprocity&quot; idea of the first few 
				years to the principle of service to and thoughtfulness of 
				others. The code was widely used for many years.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				It also led to another development. At the Houston convention 
				amid a great deal of talk as to &quot;just where Rotary is going,&quot; a 
				Philadelphian named Guy Gundaker, who later was R. I. president, 
				was appointed to head a special committee charged with studying 
				Rotary principles and objectives. Ultimately, Gundaker produced 
				a small book, a combination of four earlier pamphlets, under the 
				title, <i>A Talking Knowledge of Rotary. </i>Besides being the 
				birth of </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Rotary program literature, it was the first definite 
				formula­tion of principles and objectives.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				From this little book grew a widespread development of codes of 
				ethics for various <i>non-Rotary </i>organizations. This began 
				in 1922 when Rotarian Gundaker, a restaurateur, was asked by his 
				trade association, the American Restaurant Association, to draft 
				a code for it. When adopted by the Association, this code became 
				the model for many other trade and professional groupsnot only 
				in the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
				but also in other countries as well.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Rotary crossed the boundary between <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>
				and the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
				in 1910 and in 1911 crossed the <st1:place w:st="on">Atlantic 
				Ocean</st1:place>
				to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region>
				and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Great 
				Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>; thus, the term 
				&quot;National&quot; was no longer appropriate. In 1912 the organization 
				became the &quot;International Association of Rotary Clubs.&quot; By 1921 
				the 1,000th club had been chartered (<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">York</st1:City>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region></st1:place>) 
				and the Rotary banner had been planted firmly in such places as <st1:State

				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The first international convention to be held outside the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> was held in 1921 at <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Edinburgh</st1:City>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">
				Scotland</st1:country-region></st1:place>. The Rotarians made 
				quite an impression on the Scots as they landed singing &quot;I'm 
				Just A Little Prairie Flower.&quot; But there was also a seriousness 
				about the delegates in session, and there were signs of concern 
				about principles and an emergent idealism. A past president put 
				it into words when he told the convention, &quot;In the past, 
				missions have been either political or commercial. We come as 
				neither. We come as <i>men&quot;</i></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Edinburgh</st1:place></st1:City> convention was 
				important to Rotary in many ways. Delegates came to the 
				convention keenly aware of personal membership in an 
				organization which was big and getting bigger every day. There 
				were trends which needed examiningtrends which called for 
				resolution if the organization were to continue to grow. 
				Consideration needed to be given to the structure of the member 
				clubs and of the International Association itself.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				One of the most important conclusions reached by the convention 
				was that there should be a new standard club constitutionnot so 
				rigid as to inhibit club autonomy, but sufficiently uniform as 
				to gather up the fundamentals in an acceptable form. A committee 
				should be appointed, the convention agreed, to structure such a 
				document; in addition, several principles were approved for 
				guiding such a committee.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				A 31-member committee composed of one from each of the 25 
				districts, two from the clubs in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Great Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>
				and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ireland</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 
				and four appointed by the international president came into 
				being to implement the guiding principles. As the chairman put 
				it: &quot;Our problem was not to reorganize a failing or bankrupt 
				institution. The reason we were called together . . . was 
				because of the . . . tremendous growth of Rotary. (We were 
				dealing) with the problem of enabling a great success to be more 
				successful, if possible.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The committee met for seven successive days in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>, presenting suggestions, 
				harmonizing points of view, and finally producing the draft of a 
				&quot;working document.&quot; A &quot;polishing&quot; committee took over, meeting 
				four days in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New York</st1:place></st1:State>, 
				three in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>, 
				and two in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Buffalo</st1:place></st1:City>again 
				polishing and condensing. The final document was pre­sented to 
				the 1922 convention in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Los Angeles</st1:place></st1:City>, where it was approved to 
				become the basic structure of Rotary and of Rotary clubs.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				In essence, the new document gave official form to what had 
				become widespread practice. The name was changed to the simple 
				one of today&quot;Rotary International.&quot; The committee structure was 
				simplified, and the convention urged all clubs to appoint a 
				classifications committee testimony to the high importance 
				attached to this subject. By resolution, the convention set up a 
				standard that a </span>
				<span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">classification must 
				represent 60 per cent or more of its holder's business or 
				professional activity.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				The 1922 convention also witnessed the refinement of the 
				&quot;objects&quot; of Rotary. The early versions had empha­sized the 
				&quot;business motives&quot; but the gradual evolvement of goals reflected 
				concerns common to a new organization; e.g., in 1910 the first 
				object was &quot;to extend and develop Rotary principles by the 
				organization of affiliating Rotary clubs throughout <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&quot; The 
				1912 convention talked about &quot;standardizing&quot; Rotary principles, 
				and the first model constitution and by-laws for a Rotary club 
				was approved, with five objects covering such things as 
				promoting the worthiness of all legitimate occupations, 
				encouragement of high ethical standards, increasing efficiency 
				by exchanging ideas, promoting acquaintance, and quickening the 
				interest of each member in the public welfare and civic 
				development.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				In 1915 a sixth object was added to the club objects, &quot;to 
				stimulate the desire of each member to be of service to his 
				fellow men and society in general.&quot; There were slight 
				differences between the objects of the international 
				organization and those suggested for the Rotary club until 1922, 
				when the same objects were established. There were six objects 
				until 1935 when the Mexico City Convention adopted four objects. 
				In 1951 the convention agreed that Rotary had only one object 
				with four parts.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				These parts, then, became the &quot;four avenues of service&quot;: club, 
				vocational, community, and international respectively.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				The object and its four avenues are fundamental in Rotary, the 
				club administration being organized around them, but almost as 
				fundamental is Rotary's dual motto, &quot;service above selfhe 
				profits most who serves best.&quot; It was in 1910 at the closing 
				banquet of the first convention at which the existing sixteen 
				clubs were federated into the National Association that a 
				Chicago Rotarian, Arthur F. Sheldon, made reference in a speech 
				to the businessman of conscience in terms that &quot;he profits most 
				who serves his fellows best.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				The following year at the convention in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">
				Portland</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Oregon</st1:State>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:country-region></st1:place>, 
				he again used the phrase, in slightly altered formthis time, 
				&quot;he profits most who serves best.&quot; The delegates liked it so 
				much that it was picked up and added as the last paragraph of 
				the &quot;Rotary platform&quot; which that convention adopted.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Another businessman, Frank Collins, president of the newly 
				organized Rotary Club of Minneapolis, in an impromptu speech at 
				the second convention in 1911 used the phrase &quot;Service, not 
				Self.&quot; It also became a popular expression and was later adapted 
				to &quot;service above self.&quot; Within a few years both phrases had 
				become the unofficial slogans of Rotary, until eventually made 
				official by convention action in 1950.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Beginning in a small office on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">
				Dearborn Street</st1:address></st1:Street>
				in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>, 
				Rotary spread around the world in the first fifty years. As it 
				spread geographically and the number of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
				</span>clubs increased, basic concepts were created which became 
				a part of the pattern. Ever evolving, these concepts were made 
				manifest in diverse wayssome in the official documents, others 
				in the codes and mottoes, still others in the creative 
				leadership which has characterized Rotary's history.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Rotary's Golden Anniversary Convention in 1955 was held in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>. The actual anniversary 
				memorializations began on 23 February culminating with the 
				pageantry of the convention on 29 May-2 June, but the 
				outstanding element was not the convention, fine as it was. It 
				was the way in which clubs and Rotarians throughout the world 
				seized the opportunity for re-dedicating themselves to the ideal 
				of service. Countless numbers of &quot;golden anniversary&quot; projects 
				were initiated, some for completion within the anniversary 
				period, others extending far into the future; some, as a matter 
				of fact, became permanent activities, a perpetual commemoration. 
				One of the outstanding developments of Rotary history, The 
				Rotary Foundation, provided the central theme of a motion 
				picture, &quot;The Great Adventure,&quot; and called attention far and 
				wide to Rotary activity.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				A souvenir book, <i>Rotary: Fifty Years of Service, </i>told a 
				fascinating story of Rotary development against the pano­rama of 
				the half century. <i>The Rotarian </i>magazine printed a special 
				edition; 27 nations issued commemorative postage stamps, an 
				event unprecedented for a non-governmental organization and high 
				testimony to the value the world has come to place on Rotary.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				The Rotarians and their families who returned to the 
				international convention in 1955 also dedicated a new world 
				headquarters buildingthe story of which deserves more than 
				passing mention. As early as 1920, President Albert S. Adams in 
				his address to the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Atlantic City</st1:place></st1:City>
				con­vention envisioned the day when Rotary would have its own 
				home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				&quot;Some day I hope to see our headquarters in a beautiful building 
				of our own,&quot; he said. &quot;A building that will typi­fy in its 
				architecture the spirit of Rotary ... In that building I would 
				like to see the most perfect business office in the worlda 
				model for all men to study, with every comfort and convenience 
				for the health and con­tentment of our employees ... It sounds 
				like a dream, doesn't it? But it can be done.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				During the intervening years there were spasmodic efforts to 
				arouse interest, and there was considerable study by Rotary 
				committees. At the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Minneapolis</st1:place></st1:City> convention in 1928 the board of 
				directors was authorized &quot;to acquire a suitable site and/or 
				building in the City of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>&quot; as a permanent Rotary 
				headquarters. This action resulted in the appointment of a 
				building committee. Prospective sites were examined and floor 
				space was estimated. On two occasions, papers were drawn and 
				ready for signing. Then came the depression years, and the offer 
				of a lease with considerably reduced rentan offer so attractive 
				that it was accepted.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The idea of a headquarters building was only temporarily laid 
				aside, however; several important events taking place between 
				1941 and 1951 demonstrated that the idea was not to be 
				forgotten. The convention at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>, in 1944, took action removing the 
				restriction that the headquarters must be located in the city of <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>. Following this 
				action, proposals were received from other cities.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				In 1951, the board of directors received a recommendation from 
				the finance committee to the effect that serious consideration 
				should be given to the advantages afforded by a new headquarters 
				building, in view of the impending expiration of the current 
				office lease. Accordingly, President Frank E. Spain appointed a 
				special committee to investigate possible sites in several 
				cities, among them an unimproved corner location in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Evanston</st1:place></st1:City>, a northern suburb of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>. An option was secured on this 
				property, and this action was sustained by the <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mexico City</st1:place></st1:City> conven</span><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">tion 
				which &quot;confirmed, endorsed, and ratified the action taken, as 
				well as any and all relevant actions taken subsequently.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				And thus, for the first time since President Adams &quot;dreamed a 
				dream&quot; 30 years before, the vision of Rotary in its own home 
				began to materialize into an actuality. In 1952-53, the board 
				authorized the appointment of a headquarters committee to follow 
				through on all matters re­lating to the building of a Rotary 
				headquartersto acquire the site under option and &quot;to employ 
				architects to prepare detailed plans and specifications.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				On a bright, sunny afternoon in May, 1953, the then president of 
				Rotary International, H. J. Brunnier, turned the first symbolic 
				shovelful of earth, and immediately thereafter construction work 
				began. Rapid progress was made. As, the cornerstone was eased 
				into place on <st1:date Month="5" Day="16" Year="1954"
w:st="on">16 May, 1954</st1:date>, attention was called to the Rotary motto 
				carved on its surface: &quot;Service Above SelfHe Profits Most Who 
				Serves Best.&quot; Within the copper lined receptacle inside the 
				cornerstone, repose historic Rotary documents and other 
				mementos, including recordings made by Paul Harris during his 
				latter years. Rotary's founder had died sud­denly on <st1:date
Month="1" Day="27" Year="1947" w:st="on">27 January, 1947</st1:date>seven years 
				before the building was completed.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				In his many reminiscences, set forth in <i>My Road To Rotary,
				</i>published after his death, he wrote of his arrival at the 
				age of three at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Wallingford</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Vermont</st1:State></st1:place>. 
				The father, after a business failure in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">
				Racine</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Wisconsin</st1:State></st1:place>, had brought his two 
				boys, Paul and Cecil (the latter then five) to live with their 
				grandparents, Howard and Pamela Harris. The three had arrived 
				late at night by train and were met by Grandfather Harris.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				&quot;Grandfather, father, Cecil, and I,&quot; Paul related, &quot;turned north 
				at the first corner, crossed the road, and grandfather opened a 
				gate and we entered a yard. As we approached the side veranda of 
				a comfortable-looking house, a door opened and a dark-eyed 
				elderly lady stepped out into the darkness holding a kerosene 
				lamp above her head and peering out into the night. She was 
				father's mother and was destined to be mine as well.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				For nearly eighteen years, Paul was to endure the rigors of the <st1:place w:st="on">
				New England</st1:place> winters and to enjoy the beauty of its 
				summers; he was to learn the ways of prudence and frugality, and 
				always he was to be surrounded with the abid­ing love of his 
				grandparents.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				This persevering, hard working, and thrifty <st1:place w:st="on">
				New England</st1:place>
				couple believed that a boy should have plenty of sunshine and 
				space in which to play. So, as a boy, he roamed the countryside 
				in the neighborhood of <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Elfin</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">

				Black</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mountain</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> always an 
				adventuresome chal­lenge. They also believed in the value of an 
				education; they made it possible for Paul to attend grade and 
				high school.</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				He had entered <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Princeton</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>he was then about 
				eighteenwhen he received word of his grand­father's death; and 
				it was not long afterward that he re­turned for a short visit to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Wallingford</st1:place></st1:City>. Paul related with deep feeling a 
				conversation with his grandmother during one of their frequent 
				walks together in the orchard at sunset:</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				&quot;Paul, I wonder at times if you realize how much you meant to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pa.</st1:place></st1:State> At times, it used to seem to him that his 
				life had been a failure . . . And then you came to us quite 
				providentially and Pa fastened all his hopes on you. Paul, you 
				must not fail him. Work hard and live honorably for your 
				grandfather's sake.&quot;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				As Paul later looked back over a life of three-score and ten 
				yearsa life of excitement, adventure, and achieve­ment, all in 
				the fullest measure, he wrote:</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				&quot;When one looks back over a long period of years, much which
