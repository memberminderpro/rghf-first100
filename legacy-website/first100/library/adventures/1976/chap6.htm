				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:26.0pt;color:black">
				Four avenues of service</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				An the winter of 1928, King George V of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
				recovered from a serious illness through use of a new 
				electrotherapeutic treatment—a sun-ray machine.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				After his recovery, the Rotary Club of St. Pancras, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">
				London</st1:City>,
 <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region></st1:place>, was 
				addressed by a physician, who described the new treatment.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				In his audience was Rotarian George Kimber, who had not been 
				overly active in club affairs.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				These three facts combined to produce an example of Rotary 
				action which began when Kimber surprised his president by asking 
				to attend the next board meeting. Invited as a matter of course, 
				Kimber told the board he had been doing a bit of thinking about 
				the King and the new sun-ray treatment. Kimber explained he had 
				led a fairly active business life and he had not had much time 
				to attend to anything else. Now he would like to take a hand in 
				something outside his own business.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				&quot;I've been thinking,&quot; he said, &quot;it would be a grand thing if the 
				poorest child in St. Pancras, when needing it, could get just as 
				good treatment as King George. We ought </span>
				<span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">to have available 
				here in St. Pancras that same sun-ray treatment which even the 
				neediest child could have. This club should do something about 
				it.&quot;</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				That was the beginning of what later became the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
				Camden</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Town</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> clinic. George Kimber 
				contributed heavily in a financial way, but he made an even 
				larger contribution by initiating and organizing the project. It 
				is an example that can be duplicated many times in Rotary 
				annals—one of the basic reasons why Rotary has attained such 
				success and growth. It is the translation of a theory and an 
				ideal into practical service.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				The translation begins with the object of Rotary, quoted in full 
				on page three. This sets forth the ideal of service as the goal, 
				and from it derives the Rotary concept of four categories of 
				service. These &quot;avenues&quot; channel the operations of a world 
				fellowship of business and professional men into &quot;service above 
				self.&quot;</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				The avenues are: club, community, vocational, and international 
				service. In each of these are broad opportunities matching the 
				individual's talents and interests. These talents may be put to 
				work through the individual, through stirring the club to 
				action, through club action stirring the individual, or in a 
				completely non-Rotary context where action results from Rotary 
				principles. As a general rule, in all the avenues Rotarians 
				co-operate whole-heartedly with other organizations seeking the 
				same goal and, often as members of those other groups, they are 
				responsible for turning them toward the goal.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Club service activities in themselves offer a fruitful field, 
				especially to the newer member. Since they constitute the base 
				of operations, the foundation of all other Rotary work, they 
				have been termed the &quot;most essential.&quot; There can be little 
				effective service if the club's structure and mechanics are 
				weak. One of the member's first obligations is to strengthen his 
				own club.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Vocational service links business or profession with the 
				member's obligation to apply Rotary standards outside of Rotary. 
				It is incumbent upon him, since he is the representative of his 
				vocation in the club, to maintain its standing therein. And 
				conversely, since he is the represent­ative of Rotary (in the 
				community) to his vocation, it is equally incumbent to carry to 
				it his special knowledge. Hence, this is the field where Rotary 
				principles are most often applied in a non-Rotary context.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Every Rotarian also is a citizen of his community, with a 
				citizen's interest in its welfare and progress. Rotary 
				membership intensifies this interest because it usually opens 
				his eyes to unsuspected opportunities.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Finally, membership in a world organization provides a unique 
				opportunity to attack the most pressing problem of modern times: 
				misunderstanding between peoples and nations. Again the Rotarian 
				is in a favored position to do something here by virtue of his 
				personal contacts through Rotary with persons in almost all the 
				other nations of the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.5pt;color:black">
				CLUB SERVICE</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				A traveler in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region> heard of a 
				mountain chapel containing many paintings of exceptional beauty. 
				With high expectations—and at considerable personal 
				inconvenience —he made his way to the remote spot. However, when 
				he entered and looked around, he was bitterly disappointed. The 
				paintings were lifeless and unexciting.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Muttering, he turned to leave, when a small, elderly guide 
				approached him.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				&quot;You are disappointed, sir?&quot; the guide inquired.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				&quot;That's not the word,&quot; replied the traveler. &quot;These paintings 
				aren't worth going around a corner to see!&quot;</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				&quot;Ah,&quot; said the guide, and without a word he led the visitor to a 
				spot exactly in the center of the hall.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				&quot;Now look,&quot; he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				The traveler was amazed. The paintings which he had thought to 
				be mere blobs were now vibrant with beauty as light angled in to 
				intensify and differentiate colors.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				So it is with club service. With proper positioning and lighting 
				coming through Rotary information, what appears to be mere 
				routine administration becomes vital and challenging. Club 
				service can be the beginning of the member's adventure in 
				service.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Having a good Rotary club resolves itself to some fundamentally 
				simple things, such as being present at meetings to participate 
				in the club fellowship, paying dues on time, serving as an 
				officer or committeeman, assisting in programming and other 
				things which give purpose and meaning to the weekly meeting. It 
				also means representing the club in outside activities, speaking 
				at other Rotary clubs, attending intercity meetings, district 
				conferences, conventions, and assisting in organizing new 
				clubs—one of the most important obligations, since new Rotary 
				clubs are traditionally sponsored by existing clubs.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				As specified in the object, club service leads the member to 
				&quot;the development of acquaintance as an opportunity for service.&quot; 
				It is the most fundamental field, since the other three avenues 
				can be traveled effectively only when there is full appreciation 
				of Rotary principles and policies. This appreciation, applied to 
				the reality of club life, develops only from personal service. 
				It is summed up by an inscription on the statue of a famous 
				statesman: &quot;Not what he got, but what he gave.&quot;</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Sometimes personal service has results far beyond the local 
				scene. One of the delegates to the first International Labor 
				Conference held in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State> in 1919 was an <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Amsterdam</st1:place></st1:City>, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Holland</st1:place></st1:City>, businessman named Anton Verkade. 
				After the conference he visited a friend in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Seymour</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Indiana</st1:State>, <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:country-region></st1:place>, who took him to a meeting of 
				the new Rotary club, organized just a year previously. Anton 
				Verkade was greatly impressed by what he saw and heard. The easy 
				camaraderie of these men meeting for lunch, their broader 
				purposefulness in considering the needs of the community and the 
				nation, appealed to him. On his return to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Amsterdam</st1:place></st1:City>, he resolved to organize a similar 
				club.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				His prudent Dutch friends told him it couldn't be done, that 
				this was just another fad of the impetuous Americans, a fancy 
				that could not last and which had no application in the very 
				different community that was <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Amsterdam</st1:place></st1:City>. Verkade, however, persisted. With 
				the help of a few close friends, he organized the Rotary Club of 
				Amsterdam in November, 1922. Anton Verkade was the first 
				president; subsequently he became a director of Rotary 
				International, and his club foreshadowed some 80 other clubs 
				organized in The Netherlands during the next three decades. In a 
				way, it began with a man who went to lunch with a friend in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Seymour</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Indiana</st1:State>, <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:country-region></st1:place></span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Obviously, all club service is not that broad or spectacular. 
				Most of it is purely local: the bringing in of a new member, 
				attendance at a &quot;fireside meeting&quot; and similar things. It is 
				delineated in the activities usually considered part of it: 
				attendance, classification, fellowship, programs, club bulletin, 
				magazine, Rotary information, and public information.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Attendance already has been described as the basis of all other 
				Rotary activity. This cannot be emphasized too strongly. If a 
				member is consistently absent, he is not participating and 
				cannot contribute. Most of the rest of Rotary derives directly 
				from attendance at the weekly meetings.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Fellowship, for example, begins at the meeting and at other 
				Rotary gatherings. It is carried forward by common work toward a 
				common goal, which is why a Rotarian, asked to assume a 
				responsibility, does so willingly. It is because he knows from 
				experience that it will result—the objective quite aside—in the 
				finest kind of fellowship, the fellowship of working together. 
				In many communities men address each other by their first names, 
				another custom of Rotary which helps break down the barriers 
				between men.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				The club, of course, has a fellowship committee charged with 
				planning special events, making seating arrangements, 
				recognizing unusual service—civic or otherwise— by individual 
				members, and other things of that nature. This committee cannot 
				function in a vacuum, however; it depends upon the participation 
				of all members.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				All of this revolves about attendance, the importance of which 
				is indicated by the fact that clubs the world over maintain an 
				average attendance around 85 per cent. There are times, of 
				course, when absence is unavoidable; in that case, most members 
				endeavor to &quot;make up&quot; at a convenient club either the week 
				before or the week after, as explained earlier. If a member is 
				traveling, his club secre­tary can supply a copy of the <i>
				Official Directory, </i>which lists the times and places of 
				meeting of every club in the world. A Rotary membership card is 
				the only introduction needed.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Rotarians take pride in their attendance records, and one</span><span style="color:black">
				</span><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">reason for it 
				is the imaginative type of programming in many clubs. The weekly 
				program has been rescued from the dull and stereotyped by the 
				touch of imagination. One of the larger clubs, for example, 
				wishing to dramatize the traffic problem, stationed nurses in 
				white uniforms at the door to the dining room. As members 
				entered, they had to pass in single file between two ambulances. 
				At each end of the head table, a regulation traffic light 
				blinked red, amber, and green during the meeting.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Another club, presenting a program on fire safety and fire 
				rescue methods, climaxed the speaker's address with a realistic 
				demonstration. As soon as the speaker had concluded his talk, 
				firemen entered the room through the windows and proceeded to 
				carry out some of the members on ladders which had been placed 
				in position outside the building.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Programs at the weekly meeting generally gear closely into 
				timely and local topics, placing important issues within the 
				context of Rotary objectives. Member participation is also a 
				characteristic of many programs, with increasing emphasis upon 
				&quot;buzz sessions,&quot; panels, debates, and other forms of open 
				discussion—not led, or participated in, by &quot;imported&quot; talent, 
				but by members themselves. All of these things are reasons why 
				Rotarians make a special effort to keep up their attendance.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Important as attendance is, it is almost impossible to set up 
				priorities in this field of club service. Certainly the subject 
				of classifications would rank well up in any such listing. It is 
				the unique characteristic distinguishing a Rotary club from any 
				other club, the attribute which makes it truly a cross section 
				of the business and professional life of the community. By 
				loaning classifications to selected individuals, Rotary brings 
				together a group that is truly representative of the community, 
				but which, in most communities, is not so large as to be 
				unwieldy. It permits a cross-fertilization of ideas, a freedom 
				of discussion which </span>
				<span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">is essential to the 
				accomplishment of the work for which a Rotary club is organized.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				That is why clubs everywhere make a major effort to keep their 
				classifications &quot;clean.&quot; There is always the temptation, in the 
				case of a particularly desirable prospective member, to become 
				lax in the matter of classifying. There have been Rotary clubs 
				which have done this— to their regret. It is something that can 
				make a mockery of public protestations about being a cross 
				section of the community. The community knows full well that Joe 
				Doan is a druggist, and calling him an apple grower because he 
				happens to have a few apple trees on his farm does not alter the 
				public's knowledge. It only alters its respect for the 
				particular Rotary club.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				That is why the classifications committee of a club is 
				considered to be of such importance. Yet, classification is no 
				mystery. It simply is a matter of choosing the one word or 
				phrase which describes a man's principal and recognized activity 
				in the economic life of his community.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Most of the other elements of club service are reasonably 
				self-explanatory. What often is not immediately clear is their 
				inter-relationship. Programs, for example, can inform members on 
				club projects, on community needs, and a variety of other 
				things. They can introduce new members through the medium of &quot;my 
				job&quot; talks; they can convey general and specific Rotary 
				information. They can help inform the public, and often they are 
				the first step in a planned project.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Rotary information, however, is somewhat more specialized. It 
				relates not only to information received in weekly programs, 
				club forums, or fireside meetings, but also to reading of basic 
				Rotary literature. This includes the invaluable reference, the
				<i>Manual of Procedure, </i>a handbook of all the basic 
				procedures of Rotary. The two books, <i>Service is My Business
				</i>and <i>Seven Paths to Peace, </i>are basic in any 
				understanding of the two avenues of vocational and international 
				service. Together with <i>Adventure in Service, </i>they should 
				be part of every Rotarian's library, and num­erous clubs have 
				made them a part of their public librar­ies as well, often as 
				part of a Rotary bookshelf maintained there.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The monthly magazine in two languages, <i>The Rotarian </i>in 
				English, and <i>Revista Rotaria </i>in Spanish, is read by 
				thousands of Rotarians and non-Rotarians. The magazine first 
				appeared in January, 1911, under the editorship of &quot;Ches&quot; Perry 
				and with the title, <i>The National Rotarian. </i>The reception 
				was so enthusiastic that the press run had to be extended to a 
				total of 5,000 copies. At the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Portland</st1:place></st1:City>
				convention held later that year, it was made the official 
				publication of the National Association of Rotary Clubs and 
				placed on a regular basis. In 1912 the title was changed to the 
				present one. In 1933 the board authorized publication of a 
				Spanish language edition, <i>Revista Rotaria<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The magazine fills an important need in Rotary. Not only does it 
				provide timely news and information about Rotary clubs and 
				individual Rotarians. but it also offers pertinent background 
				information on trends of the current world scene, particularly 
				as they bear on Rotary. Its articles are sufficiently 
				authoritative to be used constantly <i>as </i>reference 
				material.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

				Its influence is pervasive. Once it carried a brief account of 
				an industrial chapel built by a Rotary club in the southern <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">

				An unusual story in which the magazine played a leading role

				in the post office of one of the smaller cities in southern <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. He was attracted 
				by the cover, a painting of a sailboat, and the title of an 
				article by the historian Hendrik Willem van Loon. He took the 
				magazine home and read it from cover to cover.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				He liked what he read. During the ensuing months, he managed to 
				read other copies just as eagerly. Then, he received an 
				invitation to speak to a Rotary club. He accepted. He was asked 
				to other clubs, and just a year and a half after he found the 
				magazine in the post office waste-basket he was elected to 
				Rotary club membership. Thanks to his assiduous reading, he 
				started out as a well-informed Rotarian—and developed further. 
				Eventually he was elected a district governor and, later, a 
				member of one of the standing international committees.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

				the official district publication appears in French, German, and

				maximum internal communication.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				A key word in club service is <i>communication. </i>There is no 
				&quot;acquaintance&quot; without communication, either spoken or written. 
				In the club or district it can be spoken—accompanied by sincere 
				smiles and warm handclasps. Across the borders or seas it may be 
				written—and winged with incredible swiftness to even the remote 
				corners of the earth. But Rotary thrives best where all forms of 
				communication are harnessed—to motivate interest, to give full 
				information, to build club spirit, and to generate maximum 
				energy in the cause of &quot;service above self.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

				In a back street of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">
				Accra</st1:City>, <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Ghana</st1:country-region></st1:place>, the Rotarian was trying to 
				interest a furniture maker in a small-business clinic being 
				organized by the local Rotary club. Question arose whether a 
				competitor in the neighborhood also had been invited. &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; 
				the consultant replied, &quot;we want him, too.&quot; The prospect's face 
				fell. Evidently he didn't want his competitor to share the 
				benefits of the clinic. Thereupon the consultant produced a 
				pound note and asked the prospect to do the same. &quot;Now, look 
				here, if I give you my pound note and if you give me yours, 
				neither of us are better off. But if I give you an idea and you 
				give me an idea, then each of us has two ideas. We're both 
				better off. That's how it's going to be with you and your 
				competitor in this small-business clinic.&quot;</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Here was the very principle that led to the development of 
				vocational service in the early days of Rotary. Rotarians 
				discovered that much more could be gained by exchanging ideas 
				for improving service and efficiency rather than obtaining 
				orders for goods or services. Sharing business know-how with 
				small-business men in their communities is a contribution 
				Rotarians in the developing countries make to the economic 
				growth of their countries. The small-business clinic operates on 
				a person-to-person basis with visits by Rotarians to the 
				workplaces and discussion of problems in small groups. Dramatic 
				improvements in productivity often are introduced with little 
				difficulty. Sound financing, better record keeping, changes in 
				technology and improved plant layout lead to expanded business, 
				lower prices and more employment. To help start the</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				small-business clinic the Rotary club invites a Rotarian from 
				another country to come for a few weeks to serve without pay as 
				a consultant.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Another application of the same principle is the case-study 
				approach to vocational service. Members of a Rotary club discuss 
				problems of business or professional practice. Discussion of 
				these case studies make lively programs at club or fireside 
				meetings. Members are reminded of experiences or problems of 
				their own which the combined wisdom of the club could well 
				illuminate. To launch the case study approach, samples of case 
				studies furnished by Rotarians in many countries are available 
				from the secretariat of Rotary International.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Both in the small-business clinic and in the case study 
				approach, the initial interest is strictly practical—to increase 
				productivity, to solve a real problem. However, with surprising 
				frequency the ideal of service emerges as it did in the early 
				Rotary clubs. Vocational service is bedded in the reality of 
				actual experience and fresh meaning is given to that part of the 
				object of Rotary:</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><i>
				<span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">To encourage and 
				foster . . . high ethical standards in business and professions; 
				the recognition of the worthiness of all useful occupations; and 
				the dignifying by each Rotarian of his occupation as an 
				opportunity to serve society.</span></i><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				There are many ways in which this policy can be fulfilled. Are 
				business and professional relationships and practices in the 
				community so good that they need no improvement? Is there no 
				place for an employee courtesy contest? What about cooperation 
				-among competitors for the improvement of the business climate? 
				Would a business relations conference be of service? Can a 
				member use his trade or professional association to the ends of 
				vocational service?</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				These things have been done, many times over, by both clubs and 
				individuals. Several among the early codes of ethics adopted by 
				trade associations derived, as explained earlier, directly from 
				Rotary inspiration. And Rotary inspiration is directly behind 
				another major Rotary contribution to business ethics, The 
				Four-Way Test. As often happens, it has significance beyond the 
				business world.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The story began in 1932. The times were bleak. It was the depth 
				of the great depression in the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. 
				Factory chimneys were smokeless and the dole was the main

				A young businessman, Herbert J. Taylor, had left the security of 
				a major executive position with a food company to take over a

				desperate; a personal loan from the bank to <st1:City

				that kept it going; and a single misjudgment might well have

				<span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">Taylor</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black"> 
				knew all this. He also knew he had—as did his competitors—a good 
				product. In those grim times it can not be said that his 
				competitors were eager for him to succeed. How could <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>'s firm, with all these handicaps plus 
				the economic storm, hope to survive? The answer was that by all

				Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>'s analysis led him to the same

				The more <st1:City

				more he became convinced that, good management aside, his 
				company's survival depended upon some way of reaching decisions 
				on the lightness of policies. It needed to be a simple yardstick 
				whereby all personnel could make decisions on their own. After 
				long consideration, four questions suggested themselves :<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black"><o:p>
				&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><b>

				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				This is what came to be called &quot;The Four-Way Test&quot;.* If company 
				policies or practices could not answer all the questions 
				affirmatively, they were changed in such a way as to do so. The 
				company survived. It prospered. It came to achieve a leading 
				position in its field, respected and welcomed by its 
				competitors.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

				Later Taylor, who served as president of R.I. in 1954-55, 
				presented the copyright to Rotary International on behalf of the 
				company which had held it. The Test proved its practical value 
				in countries all around the world; it has been translated into 
				virtually all modern languages. It is displayed on signs along 
				streets and highways. Japanese Rotarians print it on umbrellas 
				they place in the waiting rooms of railway stations for the use 
				of people caught by sudden showers. Very few of these umbrellas 
				are ever lost. It appears on little plaques on thousands of 
				Rotarian and non-Rotarian desks—even on the desks of legislators 
				in state and national capitals. It has been used in schools, and 
				it remains a fundamental tool in vocational service.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

				The <st1:Street
w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Four-Way</st1:address></st1:Street> Test, 
				however, is only one of the tools of vocational 
				service—effective as it may be. Members soundly influenced by 
				the Test could never regard it as the whole of vocational 
				service. Basically, vocational service is the recognition of the 
				dignity and interdependence of all constructive work and the 
				obligation laid upon each citizen to apply a sense of 
				responsibility in all vocational matters.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Some Rotarians apply such terms as &quot;vague,&quot; &quot;intangible,&quot; and 
				&quot;theoretical&quot; to vocational service. New members have sometimes 
				heard explanations of it and murmured, &quot;I just don't get it.&quot;</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				In one case, however, a prospective member not only &quot;got it&quot;—he 
				was so impressed that it tipped the scales in favor of that 
				particular community forming a Rotary club. It seemed that this 
				city had grown to a point that its civic leaders were ready to 
				consider the formation of one service club, such as Rotary. But 
				these leaders were at the &quot;shopping&quot; stage; they were willing to 
				listen to the stories of all of them.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				A district governor related how, in the process of telling the 
				Rotary story to these community leaders, he and his special 
				representative called upon the community's leading physician—a 
				man whose word was recognized as carrying the most weight in 
				making the final decision. In the end, after all the information 
				was in, the physician was re­ported as saying: &quot;I favor 
				organizing a Rotary club. In the classification principle and in 
				the related concept of vocational service, I see a principle 
				which is different from all the others—and it challenges me . . 
				.&quot; So it was that a new Rotary club came into being.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Vocational service derives from the principle which is the very 
				core of Rotary—the selection of members on the basis of 
				classification. As a trustee of his classification, each member 
				is obligated to share Rotary's vocational practices with others 
				who are not Rotarians, and particularly with those associated 
				with him in business or profession. Vocational service is the 
				warp and woof of all professional and business relations—with 
				employees, competitors, customers, suppliers. Practicing 
				vocational service to the limit of one's vision makes a 
				difference whether an employer regards his employees as &quot;robots 
				or human beings&quot; ; it makes a difference in the kind of 
				advertisements he publishes or broadcasts; it makes a difference 
				how he reacts under pressure from a competitor; it makes a 
				difference in the quality of his service. For, the Rotarian who 
				truly practices vocational service believes that <i>service is 
				his business<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Beyond setting this objective for himself, the Rotarian will 
				take seriously his relationship to young people in the realm of 
				vocational service. &quot;Every Rotarian an Example to Youth&quot; is a 
				motto with significant vocational service overtones, and many 
				Rotarians and Rotary clubs have translated this goal into 
				concrete activities designed to help youth. Many Rotary clubs, 
				for example, have organized career conferences in which young 
				people are given helpful counsel in the choice of vocations.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Even more significant perhaps is the growing custom of Rotarians 
				making themselves available, on a planned and systematic basis, 
				for personal counsel concerning the pro­fession or business in 
				which the individual Rotarian is engaged. Who is better 
				qualified to give advice than the man who is engaged full time 
				in the occupation? In many clubs this activity goes beyond the 
				giving of advice; it results in an invitation from the Rotarian 
				to the young person to spend time—full or part-time—in a 
				temporary on-the-job assignment. In all such relationships the 
				individual Rotarian, himself well-grounded in the <i>service </i>
				aspects of his job, is in a position to help the young person 
				understand that the ultimate satisfaction the latter receives 
				from his job depends on more than how much money he can expect 
				to make.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

				The third avenue, community service, probably is the most 
				widespread single Rotary club activity in all its varied 
				manifestations. Rare is the club lacking some kind of community 
				service, although any given club may con­centrate upon 
				individual service where another will prefer corporate action. 
				Broadly speaking, the avenue embraces everything Rotarians and 
				Rotary clubs do to help improve their communities. It is guided

				The story of a Rotarian in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">
				Toledo</st1:City>, <st1:State
 w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:country-region></st1:place>, 
				illus­trates this process, although the incident itself happened 
				long before the resolution was made a part of Rotary policy. 
				This Rotarian discovered the job one day when he happened to 
				notice a 16-year-old boy without arms or legs painfully 
				propelling himself forward on a scooter-like contraption with 
				jerky movements of his trunk. Investigation revealed that the 
				boy could not read, for he had never gone to school. Deeply 
				moved, the Toledo Rotarian felt that something should be done.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Perhaps he did not realize what a field would open up when he 
				laid the problem before his Rotary club. This was in 1915, two 
				years after Rotarians in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Syracuse</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">New York</st1:State>, <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:country-region></st1:place>, had become similarly 
				interested in a crippled girl whose parents were unable to 
				afford the kind of specialized surgery required for her 
				rehabilitation. Successful in this, the club sought out other 
				disabled youngsters. What happened in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Syracuse</st1:place></st1:City>, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Toledo</st1:place></st1:City>, and in other places sparked interest 
				in pioneering service projects for all crippled children. In <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Toledo</st1:place></st1:City>, where one crippled boy caused a 
				Rotarian to be deeply concerned, a search began—a search which 
				revealed one school in the neighboring state of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>
				for handicapped boys. At that time it was one of the few such 
				schools in the entire <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. The boy went 
				there, was fitted with artificial limbs, and a process had been 
				started that led directly to formation of the Toledo Society for 
				Crippled Children. This led to state and regional societies 
				formed from similar Rotary inspiration. In all of this a 
				dedicated <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.A.</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 
				Rotarian, Edgar F. Alien—who became known as &quot;Daddy&quot; Alien—was a 
				prime mover. Eventually his pioneer work, along with that of 
				other Rotarians, helped to create national and international 
				societies for the welfare of cripples.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Toledo</st1:place></st1:City> story, however, is 
				not yet finished. One day several years later a young visitor, 
				erect and self-confident, attended the regular meeting of the 
				Rotary club. He sat at the head table, and many members assumed 
				he was one of the frequent student guests from various of the 
				city schools. Then he was introduced and began to speak—he was 
				the lad from the scooter of so long ago! He thanked the 
				assembled Rotarians for what they had done for him and for all 
				crippled children, and as he spoke he came to symbolize, in a 
				way, all the efforts, past and future, on behalf of crippled 
				children. Businessmen who listened to him were not ashamed of 
				the tears welling in their eyes; it was a moment to be 
				cherished.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Toledo</st1:place></st1:City> story typifies 
				another basic aspect of community service: corporate and 
				individual action. The two are complementary, although either 
				may stand by itself. Usually they are in double harness, the one 
				reinforcing the other. In <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Toledo</st1:place></st1:City>, as in other examples cited in this 
				book, club action derived directly from an individual Rotarian's 
				special knowledge of a special situation.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				In other cases a club project leads individual Rotarians into 
				individual service as, for example, when a club under­takes 
				sponsorship of a Boy or Girl Scout troop—one of the largest 
				single activities of clubs, by the way. An individual may well 
				become, and continue to be, the Scoutmaster long after the club 
				has turned its major attention elsewhere. There are hundreds of 
				illustrations of the policy that, when a project has been 
				solidly established and accepted by the community, it will 
				continue under its own momentum with the participation of a few 
				Rotarians rather than the club as a whole.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				It is apparent that effective community service, whether </span>
				<span style="font-size:10.5pt;
color:black">individual or corporate, is based upon knowledge, not only of 
				Rotary but of the community. Rotary clubs have evolved 
				techniques for acquiring this knowledge through intensive 
				community surveys with consequent planning to implement the 
				survey findings. One club president, after directing such a 
				survey, wrote that it had uncovered &quot;enough work to keep the 
				club busy for ten years.&quot; The key here is to avoid duplication 
				of services while simultaneously strengthening existing work or 
				filling gaps. It is better, for example, to strengthen a weak 
				Scout troop than it is to start a competing weak troop.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Clubs formalize their services in a variety of ways. One Rotary 
				club, typical of those deeply concerned about changing 
				conditions, conducted a series of what came to be called &quot;The 
				Future of Our City&quot; programs. These were monthly panel 
				discussions during which four members discussed community 
				service questions previously submitted by the entire membership.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Local newspapers became interested. At their request, the club 
				supplied copies of the discussions so that the general public 
				became acquainted with the frank observations on the city's most 
				pressing problems. Such questions as these were discussed: What 
				type of industries should our city seek to attract? What factors 
				hinder our city's growth? What is the wisest way of using our 
				natural resources? What can the Rotary club do to bring 
				increased prosperity to the city?</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				As the programs developed, many of the meetings were opened to 
				general discussion, and it was found that the programs not only 
				increased attendance but also moved members to bring special 
				guests. This resulted in the plan­ning of another series on 
				employer-employee relations.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Or take the Rotary Club of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, U.S.A., as 
				another example. Rotarians have expended nearly $160,000 on 
				various community service projects</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				in little more than a quarter century. It is done through an 
				annual, formalized method of choosing specific projects.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				The operation is simple and the method is applicable to any 
				club. Each year the president appoints a &quot;Christmas project&quot; 
				committee, charged with the duty of choosing one project for the 
				year. A constant stream of suggestions flows to this committee 
				from the membership, committeemen, and others, and the mass is 
				winnowed into a single concrete project chosen on the basis of 
				importance. This, specified in great detail, is presented to a 
				full club meeting. The presentation is a working blueprint, 
				including cost estimates; the committee must be prepared to 
				defend and justify its choice. When adopted (always unanimously) 
				it becomes <i>the </i>project for the year.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Service projects range the entire spectrum of human needs. The 
				Rotarians of Sao Paulo, Brazil, discovered that their greatest 
				community need was the education of underprivileged youth from 
				the surrounding rural areas. After much planning a Rotary school 
				was established for the primary grades, a school which combined 
				many features of the home. In addition to learning standard 
				academic subjects, boys are taught modem methods of agriculture, 
				manual arts, and home economics. Each boy is assigned a small 
				plot of land where he may apply the lessons he has learned. 
				One-third of the product of the land goes home with each boy, 
				one-third goes to the school kitchens, and one-third is given 
				the boys to sell for their own profit.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				In <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> it may be 
				an attack on illiteracy, a subject engaging the attention of an 
				increasing number of clubs the world around; or &quot;adoption&quot; of a 
				village to help lift it to modern standards. In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				England</st1:place></st1:country-region>
				it may be a home for boys; in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
				Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
				a library for the whole community or a center for &quot;senior 
				citizens.&quot;</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;color:black">
				Broadly speaking, the categories of community service reflect 
				the needs of the times: youth, conservation, urban </span>
				<span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">renewal, old age, 
				welfare of cripples, health and recrea­tion, traffic, 
				scholarships, loans and awards, rural-urban, and student guests. 
				There are, of course, many variations on these themes according 
				to local needs, but all of them contain at least one feature in 
				common: responsiveness to the changing needs of the communities 
				of men. Clubs have found, for example, that a traditional 
				project which has operated satisfactorily through many years has 
				been ren­dered obsolete, either by establishment of agencies to 
				meet the problem or through new developments which solve the 
				particular problem but create new and different ones.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				This adaptability to changing conditions is well illustrated by 
				Rotary's historic work with youth. Since the Rotary Club of New 
				York first celebrated Boys and Girls Week in 1920, clubs have 
				constantly expanded their work in this field. Science and hobby 
				fairs, student awards, youth centers, recreation camps, 
				Scouting, driver training and traffic safety—the list of such 
				activities has grown in response to changing times.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Youth work, in fact, is Rotary's long-term investment in the 
				future of the community, the nation, and the world. Rotary clubs 
				sponsor Interact clubs for young men and young women of 
				secondary school age and Rotaract clubs for young adults.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Interact clubs undertake a variety of projects to create 
				international understanding and to serve school and com­munity. 
				Rotaract clubs, which draw their membership from the 17 to 28 
				age group, carry out balanced programs of activity which include 
				at least one major project annually in each of the club's fields 
				of endeavor—to stimulate acceptance of high ethical standards in 
				all occupations, to develop leadership and responsible 
				citizenship through service to the community, and to promote 
				international understanding and peace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

				A splendid building had been erected on the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
				island</st1:PlaceType>
 			   of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Fiji</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> 
				designed to house its first vocational school and to train 
				much-needed craftsmen. Funds had run out before it could be 
				equipped, and there were few books for its library. The Rotary 
				Club of Suva decided to lend a hand as a community service 
				project. After the club had done as much as it could with its 
				limited resources, a notification of the need was communicated 
				to all Rotary clubs by Rotary International. A response came 
				from the Rotary Club of Seattle, Washington, U.S.A.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Seattle at the time was in a district matched with a district 
				which includes part of New Zealand and Fiji. The matched 
				district and club program includes all Rotary districts and 
				non-districted Rotary clubs. It provides a focus for 
				international service through exchange of correspondence, 
				programs for club meetings, exhibits, visits by Rotarians and 
				Rotary-sponsored young people and group tours organized by clubs 
				or districts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The needs of the vocational school in Suva appealed particularly 
				to Rotarians in Seattle. They began by collecting books and used 
				equipment. A Seattle Rotarian visited Suva and learned of 
				additional needs. The result was the supply of training films on 
				36 different trades valued at several thousand dollars and a 
				mobile dental clinic. The Rotary Club of Suva reciprocated, not 
				only through their frequent progress reports about the project, 
				but with gifts of local art objects which realized considerable 
				funds when they were sold to pay the expenses of the project. 
				Rotarians of both clubs united in a common enterprise.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				This is only one example of a trend in international service 
				that has attracted the enthusiastic efforts of hundreds of 
				Rotary clubs and districts. An infinite variety of projects has 
				been successfully completed. Wherever there is a human need a 
				Rotary club is striving to meet with insufficient resources, 
				there is the opportunity for a Rotary club in some other part of 
				the world community to share in the project. A district in 
				England joined forces with Rotarians of its matched district 
				which comprises several African countries to provide a number of 
				Land-rovers to serve the medical needs of people in remote 
				areas. Australian and Canadian-U.S.A. matched districts financed 
				wells for villages in a desert region of India. Hundreds of 
				Rotary clubs notify all Rotary clubs of their interests in world 
				community service, in sponsoring Rotarian consul­tants for 
				small-business clinics, in youth exchange and in other contacts 
				through a pamphlet that reports the interests of clubs in 
				projects in international service.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				World community service has been made a dominant emphasis in 
				international service by the board of directors of Rotary 
				International. It offers to every Rotarian a practical 
				opportunity to fulfill that part of the object of Rotary which 
				commits him</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><i>
				<span style="font-size:11.5pt;color:black">to encourage and

				world fellowship of business and professional men united in the 
				ideal of service.</i></span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Above all, world community service is significant in that it 
				confronts squarely the most challenging task of our 
				generation—meeting the desperate needs of the two-thirds of 
				mankind living in the newly developing countries. These needs 
				are not being met. Hunger, disease and illiteracy are 
				increasing. Through world community service, Rotar­ians can give 
				leadership that may help to turn the tide.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Obviously, the great aims of international service cannot be 
				achieved by Rotarians alone. A Rotary club must seek to involve 
				large numbers of other people in the quest for international 
				understanding. This phase of international service can be 
				accomplished most easily by an &quot;into-their-shoes&quot; conference, a 
				world affairs forum which invites local people to take the part 
				of other countries in a discussion of the great issues of the 
				day. The topic might well be world community service. This 
				program has been followed successfully by Rotary clubs in every 
				type of community from metropolitan to rural in 15 countries.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				International exchange of students is a third way—a way 
				practiced by local clubs as individual projects and as district 
				projects. As early as 1920, the Rotary Club of Atlanta, Georgia, 
				U.S.A., recorded in its minutes that its Educational Foundation 
				chairman had arranged to finance six boys from funds contributed 
				by a few members. From this modest beginning the project came to 
				be called the Rotary Educational Foundation of Atlanta. In the 
				twenty years between 1920 and 1940 approximately 900 students 
				were assisted; the total is now past the 1,000 mark. The success 
				of the program led the two Rotary districts in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Georgia</st1:place></st1:country-region> to 
				create a joint fund which made possible enrollments of 
				additional students from some fifty countries in American 
				colleges and universities.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Only the scope of the project differentiates it from literally 
				hundreds of other student projects of Rotary clubs. Thousands of 
				young persons are involved annually in such exchange projects. 
				Rare is the club which has not had contact, in one form or 
				another, with a student from another country, and both sides 
				have been enriched by the meetings; often the young people 
				assist in marking World Understanding Week in September, another 
				international service activity spreading around the world.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The Rotary Foundation, through its various programs— Graduate 
				Fellowships, Undergraduate Scholarships, Technical Training, 
				Group Study Exchange, and Special Grants—has provided a common 
				channel for efforts of Ro­tary clubs and Rotarians worldwide to 
				give substance to their hopes for world peace. The Foundation 
				traces back to 1917 when the late Arch Klumph, then president of 
				the International Association of Rotary Clubs, pointed out the 
				need for an endowment in order for Rotary to &quot;measure up to its 
				full opportunities for service during the years to come.&quot; He 
				envisioned &quot;some great educational service to mankind.&quot; The 
				world was in the midst of the first global war, and men's minds 
				were deeply concerned with the spiritual collapse the conflict 
				represented.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The idea of such a foundation took root. The 1928 convention 
				formally adopted a Rotary Foundation. The 1938 convention 
				approved a plan to raise two million dollars for its programs. 
				World War II interrupted the fund-raising endeavor, but further 
				emphasized the need for such a program. In 1947, Paul P. Harris, 
				the founder of Rotary, died. That year marked the launching of 
				The Rotary Foundation Fellowships program, which enables 
				selected students to engage in a year of graduate study in a 
				country other than their own. Acting in the dual role of scholar 
				and ambassador of goodwill, these young people are able to serve 
				as bridges of friendship and understanding between the peoples 
				of their home and host countries during and after their 
				Fellowship year abroad. In the months after the death of 
				Rotary's founder, contributions in tribute to his memory reached 
				more than one million dollars. In 1947-48, the first Fellowships 
				were granted to 18 students from seven different countries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Since then new programs have been added. Undergraduate 
				Scholarships are similar to Graduate Fellowships. Both awards 
				pay travel, living expenses, tuition and other educational fees 
				for a year of study abroad.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The Technical Training program makes awards to young technicians 
				and artisans for training abroad. Awards have been made in 
				diverse fields such as medicine, agricultural and engineering 
				technology, mining, advertising art and hotel management. 
				Travel, living, and educational expenses are paid by The Rotary 
				Foundation. Local Rotary clubs provide guidance and counsel to 
				Trainees as­signed to their communities.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Today, every Rotary district in the world is eligible for an 
				educational award—Graduate Fellowship, Undergrad­uate 
				Scholarship, or Technical Training—every year.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				In the Group Study program, teams of five young business and 
				professional men reciprocate visits of two months</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				or more between districts in countries paired for that purpose. 
				Participants are able to study the institutions of the host 
				country and. experience all aspects of life in that land. Travel 
				between countries is paid by The Rotary Foundation; meals, 
				lodging and transportation during the visit are provided by 
				Rotarians of the host district.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				Lively interest is created by participants in these programs 
				when they return home to report their experiences. One Group 
				Study Exchange team member said: &quot;When our Group Study Exchange 
				takes place, an international awareness is generated in 
				literally thousands of people. For the first time in many cases, 
				they have a meaningful involvement with a concept—international 
				goodwill and understanding—leading to an international community 
				which never before has had expression other than in speeches of 
				statesmen and writings of philosophers. An ideal has been given 
				a tangible experience!&quot;</span><span style="color:
black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:black">
				The programs of the Foundation are possible because of the 
				voluntary contributions by individuals and Rotary clubs 
				worldwide. Some Rotarians have left bequests; others take out 
				term insurance policies in favor of the Foundation; and 
				substantial direct gifts have been made. This support enables 
				the Foundation to grant more than 500 Graduate Fellowships, 
				Undergraduate Scholarships, Technical Training and Group Study 
				Exchange awards annually.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

				mid-west, said, &quot;Many times I hear people saying: 'I should like
