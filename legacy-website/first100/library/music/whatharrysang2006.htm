		This evening we welcome our District Governor and other distinguished 
		guests with a song that takes us back to the very early days of Rotary. 
		Let Me Call You Sweetheart (song 196 on page 39 of our Song Book) was 
		one of the big hits of 1910. Its special significance to Rotarians is 
		that it was the first song ever sung at a Rotary meeting. (see below)<br>
		<br>Harry Ruggles, known as the fifth Rotarian because he joined the 
		Chicago Club at its second meeting on 9 March 1905, was also its first 
		song master. At a rather dull club meeting one evening in the Sherman 
		Hotel, he suddenly shouted “Gosh fellows, let's sing!” &quot;By that time,&quot; 
		he reminisced many years later, &quot;I was standing on my chair, waving my 
		arms and swinging into Let Me Call You Sweetheart.&quot; Was it a coincidence 
		that the hit had been published in Chicago?<br><br>The song was the biggest 
		success ever for the song writing team of Beth Slater Whitson 
		(1879-1930), who wrote the words, and Leo Friedman (1869-1927), who 
		composed the music, following on from an earlier hit they had had with 
		Meet Me Tonight in Dreamland. An evergreen, it has featured in over 
		twenty films between 1929 and 1998. Bing Crosby’s 1934 recording is 
		famous, and Ethel Merman sang it in a 1932 short of the same name. It 
		was even in a 1997 television adaptation of a crime novel of the same 
		name by Mary Higgins Clark.<br><br>There is actually a lot more to the 
		song than the well known chorus in our Song Book. For the record, the 
		complete lyric is as follows:<br><br>I am dreaming dear of you,<br>
		Day by day;<br>Dreaming when the skies are blue,<br>When they're gray;<br>
		When the silv'ry moonlight gleams,<br>Still I wander on in dreams,<br>In 
		a land of love, it seems,<br>Just with you.<br><br>Let me call you 
		&quot;Sweetheart,&quot;<br>I'm in love with you.<br>Let me hear you whisper<br>
		That you love me too.<br>Keep the love-light glowing<br>In your eyes so 
		true.<br>Let me call you &quot;Sweetheart,&quot;<br>I'm in love with you.<br><br>
		(Repeat Chorus)<br><br>Longing for you all the while,<br>More and 
		more;<br>Longing for the sunny smile,<br>I adore;<br>Birds are singing 
		far and near,<br>Roses blooming ev'rywhere<br>You, alone, my heart can 
		cheer;<br>You, just you.<br><br>Let me call you &quot;Sweetheart,&quot;<br>I'm 
		in love with you.<br>Let me hear you whisper<br>That you love me too.<br>
		Keep the love-light glowing<br>In your eyes so true.<br>Let me call you 
		&quot;Sweetheart,&quot;<br>I'm in love with you.<br><br>For your interest, I 
		attach the song sheet I have prepared for our Club's meeting this week. 
		I am going to have a crack at the first verse, but won't be asking 
		members to do more than get through the chorus (once). As a rather new 
		song master, I have become aware that not all members are enamoured of 
		our singing tradition, some thinking it old hat and boring. I am doing 
		my best to turn that around!<br><br>As you can see, I have ducked the 
		question of exactly when singing came to Rotary in my song sheet. It is 
		good to know that the source of your information (other than Harry 
		Ruggles' written word) is his granddaughter, but it is not clear to me 
		that it was she who made the estimate of 1906. The expression &quot;early 
		days&quot; from someone who was not even born at the time is not really an 
		adequate support for such an estimate. If there is any more specific 
		evidence, it would be great to know about it.<br><br>You will notice I 
		describe Let Me Call You Sweetheart as a hit of 1910, but even this is 
		making an assumption that it became a hit in the first year of 
		publication. We know this doesn't always happen. Since writing this I 
		have just become aware through a website, that the biggest early hit 
		version of this song did not make it onto the pop charts until November 
		1911. <br><br>For Harry Ruggles to have launched into this song 
		spontaneously, with no lyrics available for other members to use, 
		suggests that it must have been very well known at the time. Are we 
		talking after the First Rotary Convention? If so of course, it couldn't 
		have been the first song sung at a Rotary meeting, and Harry must have 
		been thinking of some other popular song. Can his granddaughter throw 
		any light on this?<br><br>The song book referred to in my song sheet is 
		the Rotary South Pacific Song Book, compiled in 1990 by the Rotary Club 
		of Mayfield (now Newcastle Enterprise) in D 9670, and widely used 
		throughout Australia and New Zealand. Incidentally, a brief internet 
		search reveals that the first Rotary Song Book was published in 1917 or 
		1918 in response to requests by Rotary clubs. By 1920 or 1921, there was 
		a Rotary Minstrels Song Book<br><br>Dr. Richard Lugg <br>38 Woolwich Street
