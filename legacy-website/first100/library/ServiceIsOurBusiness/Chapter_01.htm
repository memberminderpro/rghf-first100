		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">An incident in one of Moliere's 
		gay comedies involves a letter which a &quot;shopkeeper turned Gentleman&quot; 
		plans to drop at the feet of a lady of quality. Seeking help in writing 
		it from a rather pompous teacher, the shopkeeper insists that the letter 
		should be written in neither verse nor prose.<br><br>&quot;It must be in 
		either one or the other,&quot; the teacher tells him.<br><br>&quot;And when we 
		speak, what is that then?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Prose.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Upon my word,&quot; the 
		surprised shopkeeper exclaims, &quot;I have been speaking prose these forty 
		years without being aware of it.&quot;<br><br>Can it be that Rotarians who 
		protest that they do not understand vocational service share the 
		bewilderment of this shopkeeper? How often the complaint is heard. 
		Vague, intangible, theoretical, are a few of the many criticisms heaped 
		upon this phase of the Rotary program. Yet of all things, vocational 
		service is the most simple and practical—the prose of each man’s life 
		and occupation.<br><br>Prose can be dull—dull as the daily grind of 
		earning a living over days and months and years of servitude. Or prose 
		can leap with inspiration and sparkle un as does the life of any 
		business or professional or humble craftsman who has discovered the 
		opportunity for service in his occupation. Servitude or service? That is 
		the choice of everyone everyday as he takes off his coat to go to work. 
		How he views his occupation is all important. The view depends upon the 
		point of view.<br><br>The point of view that Service Is My Business is 
		the simplest explanation of vocational service. All you have to do is to 
		ask ourselves, and we shall understand clearly what it means. In my 
		profession, for instance, is service my business? When it comes to 
		considering the needs of my clients or patients or pupils, are their 
		best interests in the forefront of my thoughts all the time, or am I 
		concerned mostly with advancing my career? When competition gets rough, 
		and the other fellow is crowding me? When a strike threatens or an 
		employee makes what would appear to be an unreasonable complaint? Or 
		when a complaint of my own that seemed so thoroughly justified is airily 
		dismissed ? Is service my business? Is service my business when I 
		confront the hard decisions arising from changing prices, new processes, 
		or new investments?<br><br>Service is my business—the explanation is 
		simple enough. But the situations that business and professional men 
		encounter in their daily work are vastly complicated. The climate for 
		service may be harsh and discouraging.<br><br>An enthusiastic exponent 
		of vocational service tells of his disappointment;<br><br>&quot;The business 
		in which I am interested is reduced to one-third of what it was six 
		years ago and is still losing money because my competitors can 
		undersell.<br><br>Why can they undersell?<br><br>&quot;(1) By underpaying the 
		legitimate wage laid down by the wage agreement;<br>&quot;(2) By working employees at cut piecework 
		rates and making them take work home to be made up by their families;<br>
		&quot;(3) By forcing employees to sign a receipt for the correct wages and 
		actually paying half—even a quarter of that amount.<br><br>&quot;My choice is 
		either to continue to lose money, to leave the industry, or to join the 
		unscrupulous manufacturers in their nefarious practices.”<br><br>
		Disregarding the extreme circumstances of this Rotarian's dilemma, it 
		places in sharp focus the difficulty that vocational service presents to 
		many Rotarians and many Rotary clubs. Surely the solution of his dilemma 
		is obvious. Yet it seems to have escaped him. Obviously, he must strive 
		to amend &quot;the nefarious practices&quot; and to establish decent conditions 
		for production and distribution throughout his whole industry. If he 
		could accomplish that, how much the scope service would be extended, and 
		yet it would still be his business.<br><br>The province of vocational 
		service is misunderstood when it is limited to the aims and practices of 
		Rotarians. The field is much wider, much more inviting to tangible and 
		specific action, much less a delicate matter of the private conscience.<br>
		<br>Vocational service is SHARING with others are not Rotarians—SHARING 
		with them the ideal of Rotary.<br><br>This concept of vocational service 
		derives from the principle which is the very core of Rotary—the 
		selection of members on the basis of classification. As a trustee of his 
		classification, each Rotarian is obligated to share with others who are 
		not Rotarians—and particularly with those others associated with him in 
		business or profession—the realization that &quot;service business.&quot;<br><br>
		An objective function is prescribed in vocational service for each 
		Rotarian—to demonstrate for others the meaning of &quot;service is my 
		business&quot; in all the relationships of his business or profession. For—as 
		Albert Schweitzer discerned—&quot;example is not the main thing in 
		influencing others. It is the only thing . . . But they should not think 
		'Behold, I am giving an example.’ That spoils it. Anyone who thinks of 
		the example he will give to others has lost his simplicity. Only as a 
		man has simplicity can his example influence others.”<br><br>Thus 
		conceived, vocational service is capable of demonstrations as tangible 
		as the provision of comforts for the aged or the rehabilitation of a 
		crippled child or any other of the obvious contributions that Rotarians 
		make in community service. And the duties of the vocational service 
		committee are equally clear.<br><br>In Rotary, thoughtfulness of others 
		is regarded as the basis of service and helpfulness to others as its 
		expression. To provide this &quot;basis,&quot; a vocational service committee 
		should stimulate members to think through the actual problems that they 
		are facing in their daily business or professional practice. This “case 
		study approach&quot; to vocational service is far more likely to stir them 
		than any generalized preachment. Discussion at a club or fireside 
		meeting of one man's dilemma tends to draw from others descriptions of 
		problems they are themselves facing. In this way, vocational service 
		loses its mystical character, becomes rooted in the raw material of life 
		and gives specific illustrations of how each Rotarian can &quot;put Rotary to 
		work where he works.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Vocational service is the challenge of Rotary^' is the 
		clarion call of one Rotarian. &quot;It is the main feature which 
		distinguishes Rotary as a unique organization among many societies the 
		world over. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that it constitutes 
		Rotary's main justification for existence in a world that needs the 
		Rotary conception of service in vocation today as never before.<br><br>
		&quot;For this is a time of change, a time when as never before in our 
		lifetime, we have the opportunity in the midst of uncertainty to create 
		a world in which conflict and class war shall give place to friendship 
		and co-operation, a world which shall satisfy and not frustrate the 
		toiling millions, a world based on the mutual recognition of the Rotary 
		concept of service as the basis of all worthy enterprise.&quot;<br><br>No 
		less challenging than the broad, social implications of vocational 
		service are the results of individual self-examination. Dissecting the 
		meaning of service in his business, the director of a museum in 
		Switzerland sees it as a &quot;plus^' over and beyond the responsibility that 
		he owes to the society which provides his livelihood. &quot;I can undertake 
		this responsibility lightly, sit through the appointed hours as do the 
		proverbial bureaucrats. Or I can fulfill my responsibility 
		scrupulously—do my work faithfully and take care of my personal 
		interests besides. Thereby I can give exactly as much as I take and no 
		more.<br><br>&quot;I can, however, understand this responsibility in a higher 
		sense, and start from the desire to see my work contribute to society. 
		If I succeed in that, then I perform service and give the public back 
		more than it gives me. In practice that would mean, in my vocation, that 
		I develop and broaden the use of the museum through constructive 
		thinking. I share the view of many of my colleagues that the museum can 
		and should develop a much greater usefulness in educational and civic 
		ways. If that is so and were it achieved, it would be just that 'plus' 
		which I identify with service. Service is always thought for the future, 
		the conviction that a better society can be created, a contribution to 
		the future and belief in the future.&quot;<br><br>
		Men who have not lost their vision in spite of setbacks and 
		disappointments—men who have built their business or professional lives 
		around the aim of helpfulness to others and to the community of 
		men—these find a sure reward. A Rotarian physician, invited to explain 
		what service meant in his craft, described the humble laboratory that 
		stands near the Victoria Memorial in Calcutta, India. It was here that 
		Colonel Ross discovered the cause and method of the transmission of 
		malaria. A modest plaque carries this legend in verse, written by 
		Colonel Ross himself:<br><br>This day relenting God<br>Hath placed 
		within my hand<br>A wondrous thing, and God<br>Be praised, at his 
		command<br>Seeking His secret deeds<br>With tears and toiling breath,<br>
		I find thy cunning seeds,<br>0 million-murdering death.<br>I know this 
		little thing<br>A myriad men will save:<br>0 death, where is thy sting<br>
		Thy victory, 0 grave?<br><br>The physician continued: &quot;How great an 
		honor was given Ross that millions who never knew his name should 
		breathe and know life because of him? And what shall I say more, for the 
		time would fail me to tell of Caler and Deaver and Murphy and the Mayos 
		and Koch and Roentgen and all the host of others who through ceaseless 
		vigil and an irresistible desire to know the truth subdued diseases, 
		obtained cures for pernicious anemia, stopped the ravages of diabetes, 
		quenched the violence of tuberculosis, out of weakness were made strong, 
		waxed valiant in fight, and put to flight the armies of sickness&quot;<br>
		<br>Each classification in Rotary could recite a similar roll call of 
		unsparing contributors, men who overcame many disappointments, risking 
		criticism and material loss to raise the standards of their chosen 
		vocation. There is not a man in Rotary who, looking backward, would not 
		select as his most rewarding experiences the opportunities he has found 
		to serve society.<br><br>How these opportunities develop out 
		of the rough clay of daily business and professional practice, we shall 
		now attempt to illustrate.<br><br>In what ways does your club help 
		each member<br><br>to share Rotary with non-Rotarians in his 
		business or profession?</td>
