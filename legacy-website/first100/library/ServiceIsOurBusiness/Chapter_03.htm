		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">THE significant point in the 
		following story is not that it concerns a late president of Rotary 
		International who had many important interests and distinctions, but 
		that it is the personal experience of one who had his business on the 
		main street and who had a competitor. Let him tell the story in his own 
		words:<br><br>&quot;The thought came to me many years ago. I don't have to 
		hate my competitor. There was a certain fellow I had been fighting with 
		for years, and I thought of course he must be a chiseler. His only fault 
		so tar as I know was that he chose to make his living the same way I 
		did, but at that, he seemed like a terrible fellow.<br><br>&quot;Then a 
		thought came to my mind. Somewhere in Rotary somebody gave it to me. I 
		called on him. We sat and had a chat. He turned out to be a rather 
		decent sort of fellow. The first thing you know, we began to talk freely 
		wherever we would meet. Then it happened that he had a great tragedy 
		come into his life. One of his children was taken ill and died. He came 
		over to me and said, 'I don't know how I want to do this thing. I wonder 
		it you would come over and preach the funeral sermon for my little girl;<br>
		<br>&quot;I was his enemy! He was my enemy! He was the fellow I thought I had 
		to hate. We became very good friends. He still competes with me. He 
		still gets all the business he can—but I like him just the same!'<br>
		<br>A rather similar transformation occurred in the central business 
		district of a city in Chile, where trade was suffering from the bitter 
		feuds of rival merchants. Under the influence of Rotary, some of these 
		merchants decided to go more than half way. They called a meeting of all 
		the business men in the district and got them to agree to a few very 
		simple principles. As a result, the ruthless rivalry, the unfair 
		practices, the defamations of character and products, ceased. 
		Cooperation became the watchword even to the extent of joint advertising 
		in the newspapers. The principles which they agreed to follow were very 
		simple.<br><br>&quot;Cultivate the friendship of men in the same business or 
		profession;<br><br>&quot;Beware that these friendly relations do not lead to 
		price-fixing;<br><br>&quot;Bar the imitation of brand names and the luring of 
		employees from rival businesses;<br><br>&quot;Do not ask in friendship what 
		you would not ask in an impersonal business way;<br><br>&quot;Forget the word 
		'competition' and use the words 'trade relation.' &quot;<br><br>Whether the 
		word &quot;competition&quot; is used or not, Rotarians generally would not wish to 
		give up the invigorating effects of healthy business rivalry. Personal 
		freedom and practical efficiency alike are fostered by competition. 
		Business has to keep on its toes to survive. The customer has free 
		choice where he will bestow his patronage. Better values, higher 
		quality, lower prices court his approval. A multiplying range of choices 
		is made available to win his favor.<br><br>The practical business or 
		professional man will not shrink from a rivalry that does so much to 
		improve service. Rather he will regard his competitors as fellow-players 
		in a great game, mutually interested with him in keeping the rules and 
		improving the play, just as necessary to his real success as his 
		employees, or his suppliers, or his customers.<br><br>Such would seem to 
		be the attitude natural to a believer in the virtues of free enterprise. 
		Yet how often a very different feeling prevails. The Negro, in his 
		inimitable fashion, put his finger on it. His song, &quot;Everybody Talking 
		'Bout Heaven, Ain't Gwine There,&quot; recalls that everyone talking about 
		free enterprise does not necessarily believe in it. Some deep feeling of 
		insecurity establishes barriers between competitors who could help each 
		other and their community by their shared wisdom and enterprise. Grudges 
		and suspicions develop that never receive honest examination.<br><br>Or 
		a certain embarrassment and wariness is felt in the presence of 
		competitors, unspoken—unconscious, perhaps—but thwarting any real 
		confidence. This last experience is so common, that the question often 
		arises whether competition is really a blessing, or a curse.<br><br>Is 
		competition a blessing or a curse? Rotarians who undertake their 
		vocational service as a practical program for their daily business and 
		not merely as an occasional gesture of self-sacrifice, should be quite 
		clear in their own minds about the right answer to this question. 
		Important consequences are sure to follow from the decision as to 
		whether these craftsmen, in the same business or profession, are 
		friendly allies in service or inveterate enemies.<br><br>The issue was 
		put in sharp focus recently in an address to a Rotary conference meeting 
		in Bangkok, Thailand. After establishing himself as one who liked 
		vocational service and had indeed become &quot;a permanent member of the 
		vocational service committee,&quot; the speaker declared that &quot;it is 
		extremely difficult to apply the principle of 'love your enemy' which is 
		advocated in one of Rotary's well-known publications. Frankly, I find it 
		is impossible! I put it to you that this is one of the unworkable 
		requirements of the Rotary movement. I think that in this instance, 
		Rotary went too far. A businessman will find himself in a position where 
		he should in fact endeavor to liquidate his competitor. After all, where 
		is his first loyalty? Is it not to his firm, to his employers, to the 
		people who pay his salary? If he is completely on his own in business, 
		he must look after his interests, his wife, his children, his 
		dependents.<br><br>I would not stab a man in the back on a dark street. 
		I wouldn't do that because I am a Rotarian. But I would face him and 
		stab him—I would do that. I know this is a brutal illustration, but I am 
		trying to tell you, fellow Rotarians how I feel about competitor 
		relations. To put it on a higher plane, I would say that where Rotary 
		would be useful is in the method of liquidating a competitor. I am 
		prepared to discuss that and I am prepared not to use methods which I 
		feel would be unethical. But I'm afraid that I am not prepared to 
		discuss the pros and cons of whether I should liquidate my competitor, 
		because if I feel it is in the best interests of my company I will try 
		to liquidate him although as a Rotarian, I will restrict myself in the 
		method I use.&quot;<br><br>The fact that these remarks provoked a lively 
		discussion at the district conference suggests that all who heard them 
		were not prepared to agree with the speaker. Yet he had performed a 
		useful part by calling in question a Rotary principle. Nothing should be 
		sacred in vocational service if it is to escape bland hypocrisy and 
		exercise an effective influence. Before concluding, however, that 
		realism dictates the liquidation of a competitor, even by highly ethical 
		methods, some thought should be given to the blessings of competition.<br>
		<br>To argue that competition is a curse is to take a dim view of life 
		itself, for in a sense, all people are competitors. All sellers compete 
		for the consumer's patronage. All buyers are in competition for the best 
		products. That everyone is competing for his job with everyone else was 
		illustrated by a vocational service program in which the competitor 
		relations within a college faculty were discussed. &quot;We need someone to 
		keep us on our toes,&quot; declared a Rotarian editor. &quot;That is where a 
		fast-stepping competitor helps us. He makes us put forth that extra 
		effort which wins. Should we hate a man who helps us to win?&quot;<br><br>The 
		Sherpa porter and the New Zealand bee-keeper who conquered Everest 
		proved that life below can also be fine and the spirit of man 
		magnanimous. Tempted by the little-minded to claim that he had reached 
		the summit first, the Sherpa porter replied: &quot;We went together. We were 
		tied together. No man's single effort can put him on top of the world.&quot;<br>
		<br>That competition is a blessing, on the other hand, is confirmed 
		constantly in the growth of business communities. There is the classical 
		instance of the department store in Chicago which sold adjacent lots to 
		a competitor in order that a great shopping-center would arise to 
		benefit both of them. The same idea motivated the Rotarians in 
		Mississippi who helped to rescue a competitor from bankruptcy because 
		they did not want to see an empty store on their main street. The Denver 
		florists, likewise, who rushed equipment to help a rival whose 
		greenhouses were destroyed by fire, were loyally sustaining a 
		competitive relationship that had proved profitable.<br><br>It 
		competitors help each other, consult about their business problems and 
		methods, share their trade secrets for the benefit of the consumer, 
		surely they are blessed by the knowledge that their business is being 
		built on firm foundations. The nervous feeling that the other fellow has 
		something up his sleeve diminishes. Energy is released for expansion.<br>
		<br>Hydraulic brakes had been in use on a certain make of car for a year 
		when it became known that another manufacturer planned to install them. 
		The pioneer firm promptly phoned its rival to the effect: &quot;We have had a 
		year's experience and our brakes are just about perfected. Why don't you 
		send your engineers over here and check what we've done before you go 
		further with your plans?&quot; How many lives have been saved through this 
		sharing of a trade secret? Was it not good business, too, for all 
		manufacturers using hydraulic brakes to make sure that they were built 
		and installed according to the best experience available?<br><br>It 
		competition is regarded as a curse, it is logical then to defame 
		competitors, use &quot;cut-throat&quot; tactics to drive them out of business, and 
		to seek to establish a monopoly. Such destructive tactics would be very 
		short-sighted it competition is proved to be a blessing. Experience 
		teaches that there is seldom a victor in a price war, even though it may 
		be hard to persuade of that fact the customer who is lured by 
		&quot;bargains;' &quot;cut rates; 'and &quot;economies'.' But even the customer may be 
		convinced that the offer of something for nothing should always be 
		viewed with suspicion. Some Peter somewhere is being robbed to pay Paul. 
		It may be the sweated labor that produced the bargain in the first 
		place. It may be the dealer who absorbs the loss. It may be the 
		manufacturer who sees the hard-won value of his trademark debased.<br>Or 
		it may be the customer himself who loses, through his other purchases 
		outrageously over-priced —losing what he thought to gain from the 
		&quot;loss-leaders&quot; that lured him into the store. As the realization dawns 
		upon him that someone is being robbed, the customer loses his respect 
		for business as a whole and for the price-cutter in particular.<br><br>
		On the other hand, agreements among competitors to allocate production 
		and raise prices originate usually from the conviction that competition 
		is a curse. Evidence against the long-run profit of such restrictive 
		arrangements is overwhelming. The Brookings Institution estimated that 
		during the twelve year period between 1922 and 1934, the vast total of 
		248 billion dollars worth of goods could have been produced in the 
		United States had it not been for these and similar restraints upon 
		production. A loss comparable with the cost to the United States of the 
		second world war is therefore traceable to the widespread conviction 
		that competition is a curse. Yet think how many of the parties to these 
		restrictive arrangements were ruined in the disastrous cycle of 
		inflation and world depression that marked this earlier &quot;post-war 
		period;'<br><br>And to this day—despite the extraordinary improvements 
		in technology, scale of production and efficiency, evidence of similar 
		restraints on competition can hardly be disguised. Instead of lower 
		prices that might have been expected, inflation that creeps if it does 
		not gallop is the rule in many parts of the world. Gains from increased 
		efficiency have fattened wages and profits, government payrolls and arms 
		budgets at the expense of that forgotten man—the ultimate consumer. Too 
		often, price maintenance with restricted output is preferred even though 
		it results in unemployment and idle equipment.<br><br>Without 
		exaggeration most of the dishonesties and weaknesses that afflict 
		business in all lands are traceable to the open or secret conviction 
		that competition is a curse. Because of it, great industries cower 
		uneasily behind protections of many kinds, service is cramped by fear, 
		craftsmanship by ca'canny.* What a wonderful opportunity for Rotarians 
		in any and every community to open the windows and admit a bracing 
		breeze of common sense and courage dispelling these miasmas that choke 
		free enterprise, proclaiming that competition is not a curse, but a 
		blessing; that their competitors are not insidious foes, but comrades in 
		service.<br><br>If there is a prevailing feeling of cold suspicion, it 
		is the first step that costs the most. &quot;How much I hate that man;' 
		Charles Lamb once exclaimed. &quot;Hate him?&quot; asked his friend. &quot;You don't 
		even know him;' &quot;Of course I don't know him;' Lamb answered. &quot;If I knew 
		him how could I hate him?&quot; And so with competitors—what common-sense 
		reason is there for hating or fearing men who are grappling with the 
		same problems, who share the same background and training, who have 
		chosen the same job of social usefulness? How much can be gained by 
		going more than halfway to win their friendship and co-operation.<br>
		<br>Dear Enemy — perhaps the deepest reason of all for regarding 
		competitors in this light is rooted in the very nature of life in all 
		its forms. A farmer who had won many blue ribbons for the corn he grew, 
		made a practice of sharing his best seed with his neighbors.<br><br>&quot;How 
		in the world can you afford to do this?&quot; he was asked. &quot;Your neighbors 
		are entering corn in competition with yours at the fair each year. Yet 
		you help them with your prize seed&quot; Said the blue-ribbon corn-grower, 
		&quot;Why, that's very simple. If I want to grow good corn I must help my 
		neighbors to grow good corn, too. The wind picks up the pollen from the 
		ripening corn and swirls it from field to field. If my neighbors grow 
		inferior corn, the quality of my own will suffer. If I want to grow good 
		corn, I must help them grow good corn, too&quot;<br><br>The blue ribbons in 
		all businesses and professions are won by those craftsmen who do not 
		fear the bracing winds of competition.<br><br>What steps have you taken 
		to co-operate with your competitors<br><br>to improve your common 
		service to society?</td>
