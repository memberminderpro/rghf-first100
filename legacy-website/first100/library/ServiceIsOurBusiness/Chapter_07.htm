		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">ANYONE interested in improving his 
		human relations has much to learn from the art of salesmanship as it has 
		developed through the years. To begin with, the operation of selling is 
		almost universal. The human relations of professional men, for instance, 
		are largely with patients or clients—customers, if you please of their 
		services. Every producer must seek a market, even if it be through an 
		employment office or an advertising column or a business letter. To the 
		schoolteacher, the pupil or the parent may well be represented as a 
		purchasing agent. Even the clergyman has a selling job to do. Selling is 
		a two-way process: a buyer is also involved, and all people are buyers. 
		The mistakes, the temptations, and the insights of salesmen are present 
		to some extent in all these occupations.<br><br>Salesmen, furthermore, 
		have had the courage to recognize their mistakes. More intensive study 
		has been made of the problems in selling than in any other field of 
		human relations. Much can be learned from these pioneers.<br><br>Why do 
		people buy? What do customers want, actually? How is the salesman 
		equipped to satisfy these wants? Even those whose occupation is far 
		removed from selling can apply these questions to their relations with 
		business or professional associates.<br><br>Why do people buy? There is 
		no denying that price is a great consideration. A recent survey in the 
		United States showed the importance of impulse buying, the kind of 
		buying people do when they happen to see something that appeals to them 
		and decide to buy it on the spot. Fifty-three per cent of all purchases 
		in chain stores is impulse buying. Forty-two per cent of 
		department-store business, and even twenty-four per cent of grocery 
		purchases come from buying on the impulse. Nothing freezes an impulse so 
		much as high prices.<br><br>Prices, however, are by no means the whole 
		story. People desire quality, too. Often they are apt to think that 
		quality makes an article economical at a higher price. A salesman who 
		was encountering among his prospects a good deal of price resistance 
		found that a frank admission was his best approach.<br><br>&quot;Our service 
		is not intended for any but the better rugs,&quot; was his initial statement. 
		&quot;I have called on you because I understand that you are the owner of 
		very good rugs…” If the lady of the house did not agree that her rugs 
		were better than most people's, the salesman gracefully withdrew, 
		because he could spend his time to better advantage talking to other 
		prospects who were interested in quality.<br><br>But more important even 
		than price or quality is imagination—imagination of the circumstances, 
		the needs, the motivations of the buyer. &quot;Were You Mistaken?&quot; was the 
		arresting caption of an advertisement in a Rotary club publication, 
		which lead: &quot;So you thought we were jewelers! Well, well, does it not 
		beat all how these ideas seem to get around. Just because our vaults are 
		bulging wide with diamonds and precious stones, with quaint and 
		beautiful pieces of gold and silver and platinum (and because we have 
		mentioned it from time to time) you naturally jumped to the conclusion 
		that our only business was selling jewels.<br><br>And now we have to 
		tell you that you were perhaps mistaken. What we really sell is 
		something quite different than you think. We sell the most precious, the 
		most fragile, the most beautiful things in all this world. We sell Love. 
		We sell Romance. We sell Adventure. We sell Loyalty that lasts through 
		the years undisturbed by time and tide… . We traffic in old-fashioned 
		gardens with great hedges of lilacs. We are guardians of your Memories, 
		the makers of the only dreams that last&quot; And so on to the genial 
		conclusion: &quot;Everything else in time grows old but love and truth, and 
		jewels.”<br><br>Who would dispute the insight of this advertisement into 
		the real desires of the prospective customers? Pearls of greatest price 
		are those personal associations which they wish to commemorate.<br><br>A 
		salesman who has the imagination to project himself into the mind of 
		another person to discover his real needs performs a high function, for 
		often the other person is not quite aware of them himself. The salesman 
		is able to crystallize vague desires perhaps, or he actually creates a 
		value not intrinsic in his product, but none the less real since it was 
		born of the salesman's sincere interest and perception.<br><br>How much 
		better for the salesman to study the actual needs of his customers than 
		to try to get business by mere assertion of his own will and desire for 
		an order. Baked beans were a drug on the market in one city where the 
		housewives had the habit of baking their own. All the rival 
		manufacturers had done was to clamor: &quot;Buy my brand!&quot;<br><br>Then one of 
		them had the imagination to present the housewife's side of the picture. 
		His advertisements told of the sixteen hours required to bake beans at 
		home and why home-baking could never make the beans digestible. He 
		pictured home-baked beans with the crisp beans on top, the mushy ones 
		below. Then he showed how the factory selected their beans, used soft 
		water, and steam ovens. A free sample was offered for comparison. The 
		customer was even invited to &quot;Try Our Rivals Too!&quot;<br><br>Success 
		attended this selling campaign because the salesman did not argue 
		anything for his own advantage, but unselfishly considered the needs of 
		his prospective customers. People respond to the unselfish, imaginative 
		approach—by purchasing.<br><br>What do customers want, actually? First 
		and foremost, they want to make up their own minds. They do not want to 
		be browbeaten or tricked or persuaded. They want information that 
		enables them to decide for themselves. The salesman has to let them buy. 
		They cannot be sold.<br><br>The salesman who sets out to provide the 
		needed information as lucidly, conveniently, and completely as he can, 
		is the successful salesman. A store that gives the impression of placing 
		all its cards on the table, face up, receives the gratitude of the 
		customers and their respect. They feel that no available information is 
		being concealed when every article has the price plainly marked, and 
		when they are able to wander about making up their own minds without the 
		hot breath of the salesman forever hounding them for a decision. Oh yes, 
		they want him within reach ready to answer their questions, to share his 
		experience, and to help them make comparisons. But he is wanted as a 
		friend, not as an antagonist, as someone they can trust to furnish an 
		authentic background for their purchases.<br><br>At a time when 
		technology is multiplying the supply of goods available, the estimate 
		that 70 per cent of sales lost result from indifference on the part of 
		salespeople assumes an importance vital to the whole economy. When 
		questioned about their product or service, they are prone to shrug their 
		shoulders as if to say: &quot;Don't ask me. I just work here.&quot; Or they are 
		like the salesman who offered a fine pair of shoes priced accordingly. 
		To try him out, the customer exclaimed: &quot;That's highway robbery'&quot; Did 
		the salesman tell him that he had other good shoes for less, but this 
		was the finest produced? Did he point to the additional costs in 
		manufacturing quality shoes? Not at all. He blamed the manufacturer for 
		&quot;holding us up&quot; in a tone which implied:<br><br>&quot;That's your problem. I 
		couldn't care less.&quot; Such indifference is a sure way to irritate a 
		potential purchaser and to frustrate all the ingenuity and passion for 
		perfection that has gone into the production of the goods. Only a 
		genuine interest in the products and a genuine desire to help the 
		customer equip salespeople to play their vital part in an expanding 
		economy.<br><br>Salesmen who go out. of their way to teach customers how 
		to make better use of products or get. longer wear from them may lose 
		immediate sales, but they are watering the delicate flower of confidence 
		which blossoms in repeat orders—the most profitable kind of business. A 
		wire-brush manufacturer found a way to double the service of a brush 
		used extensively on a certain kind of polishing-machine. So he made a 
		point of visiting every purchaser of this brush to show him personally 
		how die saving could be accomplished. It looked like plain suicide for 
		the manufacturer, but these visits enabled him to demonstrate also other 
		uses for his brushes. He clinched many profitable accounts and 
		profitable repeat business followed. This was not plain suicide, but the 
		salvaging of a threatened relationship, for, sooner or later, someone 
		else would have discovered the saving and confidence in the manufacturer 
		might have been shaken.<br><br>Like the fabulous Janus of Roman 
		mythology, the salesman is always looking in two directions to improve 
		his knowledge of what people want. He is the channel of information that 
		conveys the needs and desires of the consumer to the producer, as well 
		as a source of expert knowledge to the buyer.<br><br>Such, ideally, is 
		the vocation of the salesman when he is convinced that service is his 
		business. But actually… ? How does the salesman become equipped to 
		satisfy the needs of customers?<br><br>Training—specialized training—is 
		the answer. The employer of the salesman should be his teacher. To be a 
		teacher, the employer should be utterly genuine. If he is thinking of 
		profit rather than service—it he is putting pressure on his salesmen to 
		&quot;produce&quot;—then his attitude will be reflected in the salesman, whatever 
		the teaching.<br><br>The employer who is genuinely interested in 
		improved service can inspire his salesman with that sincere interest in 
		people and their needs which spells successful selling. The salesman 
		will be trained, not to win arguments, but to ask questions—to make the 
		other person feel that he is the important factor in the transaction.<br>
		<br>The salesman will be trained as an expert in his line, as a mine of 
		technical information about the background of his products—not for 
		arrogant display, but as necessary equipment for feeling his way toward 
		the actual needs and interests of the customer. An old lady listened 
		patiently to the long sales talk that a clerk had memorized. 
		Overwhelmingly, he set forth all the fine points of a stove, its many 
		“gadgets”' its chromium plating, and the like.<br><br>At last, timidly, 
		as he paused for breath, she ventured a question: &quot;Will it keep an old 
		lady warm?&quot;<br><br>No small part of the salesman's training comes from 
		his experience with customers. Arrogance, insincerity, and downright 
		deceitfulness may and often do merely reflect the kind of reception 
		accorded the salesman by those whom he aspires to serve. It is uphill 
		work for him to develop a wholehearted devotion to the interests of his 
		customers if they snub him, keep him waiting fruitlessly, and behave 
		generally as if he were an enemy and a bore to boot. Like begets like. 
		The customer who shuts himself off from these sources of information is 
		not serving his own interests. He is needlessly increasing the cost of 
		serving him. He is failing to realize that buying and selling are 
		operations, not opposite in character but essentially alike, combined 
		operations to achieve more efficient distribution.<br><br>Reproduced 
		here is a card which is prominently displayed at the receptionist's desk 
		of a company that interviews many salesmen. How encouraging to the 
		salesman a visit to this organization must be. So much depends on 
		atmosphere in a business or in a town. Every gesture of courtesy lights 
		a torch that is passed from hand to hand, lighting for each one, new 
		vistas of opportunity for better human relations and greater service.<br>
		<br>What has been said about the salesman's problems and purposes 
		applies to the buyer in equal measure. He, too, is vitally concerned to 
		secure a source of supply on which he can depend. His main function is 
		also the provision of accurate information to his source about his plans 
		and problems, so that together they can work out solutions beneficial to 
		all concerned. If all the facts cannot be disclosed by the buyer, at 
		least he will be frank in admitting it. He will never attempt to mislead 
		the salesman by exaggerations, hedging or half-truths, for such 
		insincerity is fatal to the atmosphere of cordial cooperation which is 
		his chief aim.<br><br>In the creation of this atmosphere, Rotarians can 
		play a great part, not only by their personal conduct and influence, but 
		through club activities. An interesting attempt to get Rotarians to look 
		into the mirror —as employers, as salesmen, and as buyers— was made in a 
		Rotary program where a salesman and a purchasing agent lore the problem 
		of their mutual relations apart in terms of &quot;My Pet Peeves&quot; and &quot;The 
		Kind I Like!' As members of the club joined the discussion, a richer 
		understanding of the common task of these two vocations emerged.<br><br>
		The same idea is stimulated by another Rotary club which sponsors a 
		so-called &quot;peddlers' picnic&quot; to which each member invites a salesman for 
		a day of better acquaintance and jollity at the country club. Or there 
		is the project of a &quot;courtesy contest&quot; undertaken in many towns by 
		Rotary clubs which offer prizes for letters describing special acts of 
		service by salespeople. Any Rotarian can make it his business to suggest 
		projects of this kind to his club, and any club that undertakes them can 
		be sure that the effects will be far reaching.<br><br>An unexpected 
		result of a courtesy contest, for instance, was that several local firms 
		and a hospital started courtesy contests of their own for their 
		employees. The town as a whole became conscious of the possibilities for 
		improvement in human relations, and the results quickly became apparent 
		to visitors from other towns.<br><br>What steps are you taking to 
		improve your buying and selling relationships?</td>
