		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">Is Honesty 
		Declining?<br><br>THE example of little things is infectious. Often they 
		set in motion curious reactions. One such instance is the story of an 
		American maker of locomotives. He was about to close a large contract 
		with a foreign government. He had stopped over in London before 
		proceeding on to his destination. He was not too happy about the 
		negotiations since it had been decided, at the insistence of the 
		customer, to substitute an inferior grade of steel in order to keep the 
		cost down to a minimum. It seemed the only way in which his firm could 
		secure the contract.<br><br>Leaving his London hotel one morning, he 
		noticed in a shop window some material that he thought would make an 
		attractive sports suit. After he had purchased the goods, a London 
		friend gave him the name of a tailor. The American was impressed by the 
		establishment. He was even more impressed when he met the proprietor.<br>
		<br>But when the tailor had taken one look at the cloth, to the 
		amazement of the American, he refused to make the suit. He would not put 
		his label on a suit of clothes made of shoddy material. Neither did he 
		respond to the suggestion that since the cloth had already been 
		purchased, the label could be left oft in this instance. A tailor could 
		not continue to retain the respect of his employees it he expended their 
		honest labor on dishonest material.<br><br>With the bolt of cloth under 
		his arm, the maker of locomotives left the tailor's shop, not angry, but 
		thoughtful. The nameplate on a locomotive, or the label on a suit of 
		clothes, earned respect by the quality of honest labor and honest 
		materials. Unwittingly, the tailor had set him on the right course, as 
		certainly as if he had picked him up physically from one path and set 
		him down upon another.<br><br>The first chapter in the &quot;Book of Wisdom” 
		Thomas Jefferson declared, is honesty; and more recently, a well-known 
		editor urged the need for re-establishing the teaching of common honesty 
		in the schools. On the other hand, a school superintendent supporting 
		the affirmative in a debate on the question, &quot;Is Honesty Declining?&quot; 
		placed the responsibility squarely on the shoulders of business. Boys 
		and girls leaving school, he contended, took with them definite 
		standards of honesty and fair play only to be disillusioned by the 
		practices prevailing in places where they worked. &quot;One girl went to work 
		for a dress shop—an exclusive one. As apart of her indoctrination, she 
		was taught three prices for every garment: a top price to be asked 
		first, a middle price, and finally, a minimum. Another lad, when briefed 
		for his part-time work in a grocery store, was told: &quot;Don't be too 
		particular about weights—that is, don't give anything away&quot;<br><br>If 
		honesty is not to decline, then home, school, church, trade association, 
		and Rotary club must be alert constantly to combat new tendencies—or 
		fresh manifestations of old tendencies—to chisel and to defraud.<br><br>
		Years ago, Rotary was very active world-wide in the effort to check 
		bribery and secret commissions. A past president of Rotary International 
		represented this interest at an international economic conference of the 
		League of Nations. Many countries enacted legislation to check these 
		evils. &quot;Bribery and secret commissions&quot; —the very words have a musty and 
		antique flavor.<br><br>Yet in spite of all these efforts, who can say 
		that bribery and secret commissions are a thing of the past? During and 
		since the war, black markets grew and flourished all over the world. The 
		same gangster elements that furnished the bootleggers during the 
		prohibition era in the United States now appeared as black marketers; 
		the same people who patronized them once, were customers again; and the 
		same principle of clandestine corruption was again manifest.<br><br>More 
		recently a similar situation was denounced at a district conference of 
		Rotary:<br><br>&quot;We should ask ourselves: 'During recent years when 
		members of all professions were exposed to considerable temptations, 
		have Rotarians succumbed less to these temptations than non-Rotarians?' 
		In all the professions, right from the jeweler to the apple grower, you 
		find, wherever a temptation offered itself, a high price on the back 
		market or an opportunity to pass off inferior quality for superior or 
		the like, the temptation was always succumbed to.<br><br>It is a 
		question of character. The trouble is that we look outward and not 
		inwards when it comes to charges of immorality. There are lots of people 
		who, not out of personal greed, but just on account of the fear of being 
		pointed out as simpletons, follow the general line. And to all such 
		people who think that one honest trader, one lawyer who refuses to take 
		dishonest briefs is not going to improve matters, the ancient wisdom of 
		China gives the answer. There is a Chinese proverb which says: 'It is 
		better to light a small candle than to sit cursing the darkness.' &quot;<br>
		<br>The same question might be asked with different reference in all the 
		countries which suffered from rising prices and shortages artificially 
		induced.<br><br>Could this widespread practice have been checked by 
		vigorous action on the part of trade associations? Or could a strong 
		protest rising from every Rotary club in the world, backed by the 
		example of every Rotarian and his family, have influenced the purchasers 
		and dealers alike to choose the path of strict honesty? Here was an 
		opportunity for vocational service to show its metal and prove its 
		sincerity lest it be classed with those who, in the words of Butler's 
		Hudibras—<br><br>Compound for sins they are inclined to,<br><br>By 
		damning those they have no mind to.<br><br>The opportunity is still 
		open. The path is plainly marked.<br><br>Bribery and secret commissions? 
		There is nothing old-fashioned about them at all. They have simply 
		donned modern clothes.<br><br>A whiskey salesman sat at a table and 
		ordered a drink. The proprietor followed the waiter and whispered to 
		him: &quot;What did that whiskey salesman order?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He ordered one 
		Scotch;' said the waiter.<br><br>The proprietor then placed three 
		jiggers of rum on the waiter's tray alongside the Scotch, and said: 
		&quot;Tell him that's exactly the way I had to buy it!&quot;<br><br>What happens 
		one day in a seller's market may recur in reverse order another day when 
		goods become abundant and tie-in sales are replaced by secret rebates, 
		discounts, and presents to buyers.<br><br>Laws against bribery and 
		secret commissions are not enough, though they may help to arouse the 
		public conscience. Only the clear, outspoken, and continuous influence 
		of business leaders can be effective, and then only if the leaders have 
		a vital awareness of just what constitutes bribery.<br>Too often 
		perception is dimmed by reverence for what is done. A court-martial was 
		held in the North African desert to determine the guilt of an Air Force 
		officer charged with accepting bribes from a contractor who had 
		purchased the waste products from the camp.<br><br>The most important 
		evidence for the prosecution came from the contractor himself, who 
		admitted without embarrassment that he had paid certain additional sums 
		to secure the right quantity and quality of &quot;swill,” but he repudiated 
		indignantly the suggestion that he had received something quite 
		different from swill—a few tins of bully beef, perhaps, cigarettes, or, 
		most important of all tea, coffee, or sugar.<br><br>He was a man of 
		character, and he was genuinely shocked at the idea that he would have 
		paid a bribe for something he was not entitled to, though in the 
		ordinary course of business, one paid reasonable bribes to see that 
		business was done properly.<br><br>At least such a point of view has the 
		merit of being clear and definite even though it might seem 
		reprehensible in other parts of the world. But frequently polite terms, 
		&quot;customs of the trade&quot; or &quot;pressures from business associates&quot; confuse a 
		man, so that he does not know bribery when he sees it.<br><br>Two tests 
		are available, both common-sense, both synonymous with that &quot;sense of 
		community&quot; which spells Rotary. The first is publicity. If there is any 
		doubt, for instance, whether a personal gift or a rebate or a price-cut 
		is strictly fair to all concerned, let all concerned know that it is 
		being made. An employer, or a competitor, will be grateful for the 
		information, and the recipient should be flattered to have it known that 
		he is getting this recognition. If the test of publicity arouses 
		embarrassment, then the second and determining test can be applied; that 
		is, whether the gift or other favor tends to raise or lower the level of 
		service by this business or profession.<br><br>The Rotarian who applies 
		these tests and still finds himself in a gray zone as to what is really 
		the honest course, can seek the council of the vocational service 
		committee of his club or raise the question in his trade association. 
		From the exploration of such gray zones, real progress in raising 
		standards of practice can often result.<br><br>&quot;Honesty Is the Best 
		Policy&quot; is an opinion that is credited to various writers. Emerson went 
		even further. &quot;Men suffer all their lives from the foolish supposition 
		that they can be cheated. The thief steals from himself. The swindler 
		swindles himself'.' Honesty is efficient. Dishonesty is laborious, 
		hesitant, and wasteful. This view is emphasized by a curious coincidence 
		in the dictionary definition of chiseler: &quot;(i) one who chisels, (a) a 
		child—Ireland'.' The coincidence of the Irish meaning points to the 
		essential naivete in all chiseling. Mature people just do not do it.<br>
		<br>Surely there is no necessary conflict between idealism and good 
		business. As expanding production fills the gap of previous shortages, 
		many Rotarians may find themselves in the happy position of being able 
		to choose between the alternatives suggested in the following instances:<br>
		<br>A manufacturer put on a special sales drive, and his dealers stocked 
		up. Then without warning; the advertised price on the article was 
		reduced ten per cent. One large dealer reported that he was not even 
		notified. The stores had to wriggle out of the difficulty as best they 
		could. They had bought something at a high price on which they were 
		forced to absorb a ten per cent loss even before they attempted to sell 
		it. Perhaps the manufacturer did not have the price-cut in mind when he, 
		caused the stores to increase their inventories. But the dealers said he 
		did.<br><br>This incident wrecked more goodwill than heavy expense in 
		advertising could restore in many a month. Contrast with it the policy 
		of another manufacturer in the same field:<br><br>He had moved up 
		production to a point where he was able to cut $20 from the 
		selling-price of a certain model.<br><br>Dealers were requested to 
		report the number of machines they had on hand, and checks were sent to 
		them covering the amount of possible loss owing to the price-cut—actual 
		money, not credit on more merchandise.<br><br>Is it any wonder that this 
		manufacturer has a loyal and enthusiastic dealer organization?<br><br>Is 
		the customer always right? Most men in business have occasion to ponder 
		this slogan at one time or another. A famous department store made a 
		survey which disclosed that there were 75 complaints in every 10,000 
		transactions. Consideration was also given to the possibility that many 
		customers did not complain but went elsewhere in future giving the store 
		a bad name among their friends. When salespeople in the store were 
		asked: &quot;Do you believe that it is your job to protect the customer 
		against the store, or the store against the customer?&quot; 99 per cent of 
		them gave the wrong answer.<br><br>When it comes to complaints, however, 
		a suspicion sometimes arises whether this slogan is actually true as 
		well as profitable policy. Who is to say whether the customer is really 
		justified in any particular complaint? One Rotarian found an answer that 
		worked satisfactorily. Here it is, in his own words:<br><br>&quot;About ten 
		years ago we conceived the idea of allowing our customers to adjust 
		their own complaints. Previous to that time, it had been a poker game. 
		When a customer had a complaint, he would often ask for about twice as 
		much as he expected to get. We would either try to get out of the matter 
		entirely or offer him a quarter of what he asked, and after much 
		wrangling, we would finally agree on some figure.<br><br>&quot;By our new 
		methods of making adjustments, the poker playing is eliminated. It is up 
		to the customer to be honest, as we stipulate in making the adjustment 
		that he treat us as he would like to be treated it he were in our place.<br>
		<br>&quot;Previous to adopting this policy our adjustments from all causes 
		had run as high as one-and-a-half-percent of our sales. The first year 
		after our new policy went into effect, adjustments dropped to 
		three-quarters of one per cent and have been as low as one-twentieth of 
		one per cent'.'<br><br>Is honesty declining? Or, has the business man of 
		today succeeded in removing some of the stigma which once attached to 
		his calling? Was a past president of Rotary International in Great 
		Britain and Ireland correct when he said:<br><br>&quot;Until comparatively 
		recent years, the man of business was despised. The only reason was the 
		thought, right or wrong, that meanness, dishonesty, roguery, and often 
		trickery, entered into business transactions. This has only been changed 
		since business men have attempted to put into practice the Golden Rule.”<br>
		<br>In the growth of confidence, frankness, and consideration between 
		customers, suppliers, and competitors that has replaced the spirit of 
		&quot;dog-eat-dog&quot; and &quot;caveat emptor',' the Rotarian can gain much 
		encouragement for his efforts to promote honest practices in business or 
		profession. Dishonesty is naive and ignorant. It can be exposed as such 
		by the success of persistent and resolute example. Perhaps the 
		experience of the salesman who refused to allow an unearned discount is 
		typical. He was invited to pick up the long-distance phone and check 
		with his home office because a very large contract was at stake. But he 
		steadfastly refused. Nothing could persuade him to even question the 
		established policy of his firm.<br><br>Suddenly the buyer changed his 
		mind and signed the contract, saying: &quot;A concern that can afford to be 
		so stiff-necked about its own way of doing business, must have a product 
		that can stand on its own merits.&quot;<br><br>What attitude should be taken 
		towards tipping and seasonal gifts to buyers when they are customary?</td>
