		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">NEVER is the need for confidence 
		in the good faith of employers more keenly tested than in periods of 
		great change. The evil done in the early stages of the industrial 
		revolution lived long after that generation of employers. Conditions of 
		employment in mine and mill spelled appalling misery and degradation for 
		the mass of workers. Joy in craftsmanship was exchanged for slavery to 
		the machine. Cheap products found reflection in commercial practices 
		equally debased. Only after a century of bitter struggle was it possible 
		to restore in part the standards that had been sacrificed on the altar 
		of mechanized progress.<br><br>Vocational service as it has developed in 
		Rotary can be seen as one phase of the effort to repair the human and 
		social damages inflicted by the industrial revolution. And who can say 
		that the task is completed?<br><br>Even now, it is said, we are on the 
		threshold of a second industrial revolution. Whereas machines bound the 
		worker to monotonous, repetitious jobs, new machines are emerging to 
		replace him and to do those jobs better. Whereas the first industrial 
		revolution substituted mechanical for muscular <br>power, automation 
		substitutes mechanical for human judgment, and mechanical judgment is 
		infallible. Robots will undertake the robot functions that human beings 
		have performed, and human beings will be freed to exercise higher 
		skills.<br><br>&quot;Automation, well used,&quot; a Belgian Rotarian told his 
		club, &quot;undertakes only what is not properly thought, but reflex. 
		Therefore, we should rejoice in this economic progress which is also 
		social progress.&quot;<br><br>Well used. The qualifying phrase is all 
		important. No doubt the first industrial revolution when it was launched 
		promised as much, had it been &quot;well used.&quot; But the employers of that day 
		were not conscious of the problems of transition. To them, the worker 
		was just something for which a machine had not been invented: a robot. 
		Has the present generation of employers a deeper understanding of the 
		function of human beings in production that will enable them to surmount 
		the problems of transition posed by automation—problems of upgrading and 
		training employees for higher skills, of adjustment to new forms of 
		competitive enterprise, and of distributing an accelerated production?<br>
		<br>A British Rotarian writes:<br>&quot;Nowhere can Rotarians make a more 
		vital contribution in vocational service than by giving earnest and 
		constant thought to this problem: How can I humanize my concern? How can 
		I make every man, woman, boy, or girl who works for me realize that in a 
		real sense they are my business family, sharing with me the toil, the 
		ambitions, the achievements, the hopes, the sorrows, and the rewards of 
		a joint adventure?&quot;<br><br>On all sides, leaders in commerce and 
		industry are pointing to human engineering as a new frontier. Said the 
		heir to one great industrial empire, &quot;If we can solve the problems of 
		human relations in production, I believe we can make as much progress 
		toward lower costs in the next ten years as we made during the past 
		hundred through the development of the machinery of mass production'.'<br>
		<br>These opinions were not conceived synthetically to beautify 
		after-dinner orations. They were born under the compulsions of three 
		shattering experiences, universal in their impact and of great practical 
		consequence—the world depression, the world war, and the power struggle 
		following the war. Each of these experiences demonstrated in different 
		ways that the idea of &quot;economic man&quot; was too simple, that people could 
		not be accurately denned as &quot;something for which a machine had not been 
		invented&quot; that the supreme problem of this generation was to match 
		progress in technology with progress in human relations. To state the 
		problem is not to solve it, however. Human engineering has a long way to 
		go before it catches up with mechanical engineering, and when business 
		men contemplate this enterprise they may well recall the lines of 
		Santayana:<br><br>Our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine That lights the 
		pathway but one step ahead Across a void of mystery and dread.<br><br>
		Scientists are usually the last to dogmatize, for they know how often 
		their most cherished theories are overthrown. One investigation by 
		Harvard professors devoted five years to observing the same girls doing 
		the same job. Every conceivable variation in their personal lives and 
		the conditions of their employment was carefully correlated with their 
		output. Everyone was happy with the results because improved working 
		conditions seemed to improve the output and the earnings of the workers. 
		But then one investigator proposed to restore the original 
		conditions—the forty-eight-hour week without rests, lunches, etc. 
		Output, instead of declining as expected, maintained its high level. The 
		theory that improved conditions and absence of fatigue automatically 
		increased output seemed discredited.<br><br>A world-famous manufacturer 
		of electrical equipment experimented with the effects of different 
		lighting on the productivity of workers. To control the experiment, a 
		group of individuals with no discoverable personality problems was 
		selected and every provision was made for their contentment. With 
		perfect lighting for their work, production of this group soared. When 
		lighting was reduced it made no difference. Finally, working under an 
		illumination no better than moonlight, this group remained as productive 
		as ever. Evidently, workers who are satisfied can over come physical 
		handicaps.<br><br>What are these powerful sentiments in human beings 
		that underlie and often supersede the obvious incentives of improved 
		conditions and rewards? That is a question that must interest not only 
		employers, but salesmen, teachers, doctors, and dentists, in fact, 
		anyone whose work calls for a deep-down understanding of people. Answers 
		vary infinitely and gain by being specific, but here is a general 
		conclusion reached by the Labor and Management Center of Yale 
		University.<br><br>The goals of the human organism, whether it house a 
		floor-sweeper or the president of a company, are to gain-<br><br>(1) The 
		respect of his fellow-men;<br>(2) Material comforts and as much economic 
		security as the most favored;<br>(3) Increasing control of his own 
		affairs;<br>(4) Better understanding of forces and factors at work in 
		his world;<br>(5) A basis of integrity for living.<br><br>This brief 
		excursion along the frontier of human engineering may suggest the type 
		of investigation that is taking place today. If it seems rather 
		theoretical, Rotarians may recall the remark of Michael Faraday when he 
		was showing his first experiment in electromagnet-ism. A member of 
		parliament asked him of what use it was, and Faraday replied: &quot;Well, of 
		what use is a newborn baby? But you may be able to tax this some day.&quot;<br>
		<br>Rather more might be claimed for human engineering as it is being 
		developed, not only in the study of employees, but in all phases of 
		vocational service. Each business or professional relationship that 
		involves people calls for careful examination of their goals, their 
		sentiments, and their abilities. It calls for constant re-evaluation of 
		personal attitudes and policies in the light of this examination. Each 
		store, each office, each workshop, each factory is a laboratory of human 
		engineering where living, vital knowledge is waiting to be organized.<br>
		<br>From this viewpoint, the &quot;recognition of the worthiness of all 
		useful occupations&quot; enjoined by Rotary's Object, acquires an active 
		significance. As eloquently described in a speech by the president of a 
		Chinese Rotary club in the Far East, it involves humility, 
		understanding, and leadership.<br><br>&quot;The occupation of the cobbler,&quot; 
		he declared, &quot;with his little rap-a-tap-tap stand on the street corner 
		or the shoe-shine boy yelling to you 'Shoe shine, Joe?' along the 
		sidewalk is just as worthy and dignified as the occupation of any banker 
		with his office luxuriously fitted with paneled walls, telephones, 
		cushions, and swivel chairs and all the fineries becoming of his 
		occupation. However humble an occupation be, it is up to the man to make 
		it worthy and dignified.<br><br>&quot;Have you ever had the experience of 
		taking a rickshaw ride without previous bargaining as to the price of 
		the ride? Then, at the end of the journey, you give the rickshaw-puller 
		a certain sum of money and he voluntarily returns to you some change 
		without your asking? Well I have had that experience. More than once. 
		Now what do you think of that rickshaw-puller? In my opinion, that 
		rickshaw-puller has high standards in his business of rickshaw-pulling. 
		He recognizes the dignity of his occupation. He feels that in accepting 
		the whole sum of money you give him for the ride, he would be charging 
		you an exorbitant price for his work. Ostensibly, he is trying to be 
		fair to you. But subconsciously, he is rendering a distinct service to 
		the community.<br><br>&quot;These men, though they are not Rotarians and 
		though their occupations are about the most humble in the social scale, 
		are exemplifying not only the principles of Rotary, but are building 
		upon the real foundation of all successful business enterprise—'business 
		is service'. What these humble non-Rotarians are able to accomplish in 
		their efforts to serve society, we as Rotarians should be able to do 
		better; yes, in comparing the advantages we have over these men of 
		humble occupation, we should be able to do thousands of times better.&quot;<br>
		<br>A confession comes from a Rotarian, so distinguished for his 
		relations with his employees that he was selected as an 
		employer-representative at the International Labor Conference. As the 
		result of some unhappy experiences on the eve of his departure, he was 
		feeling rather bitter about labor in general as he crossed the ocean. 
		One evening in company with some fellow-delegates in the smoking-room, 
		this feeling came to the surface in a somewhat vehement expression of 
		misgivings concerning the whole picture of labor-management relations. 
		In the midst of his lament, one of the delegates suddenly interrupted 
		him. &quot;Look here!' he said, &quot;I'm going to ask you a question. Don't 
		think. Just answer right away—quick! Do you like your men?&quot;<br><br>As 
		the Rotarian tells the story, he was considerably taken aback. &quot;Do you 
		know, I was unable to answer that question right away. If he had asked 
		me whether I loved my wife or children, I would have said 'yes' without 
		thinking. But when he put that question up to me and I couldn't answer 
		it, I knew there was something wrong with me. I should like to ask you— 
		any of you—to go and sit down in a quiet corner and ask yourselves that 
		question and see what your answer would be.<br><br>&quot;The delegate's 
		advice to me was, 'Go home and like them, and see the difference! &quot;<br>
		<br>Employees are people. Like all people, they like to be liked. It 
		makes a difference that can be apparent in many ways. The visitor to a 
		large plant where some marvelous new machines had been installed, 
		commented to the president of the company: &quot;They certainly are beauties, 
		and I expect they cost you a pretty penny. But they weren't what 
		impressed me particularly. What struck me as we walked through those 
		great shops was the look on the faces of your employees, the ready smile 
		and the words exchanged with some of them. It showed that these people 
		were glad to work with you and that even big business need not lose the 
		personal touch!'<br><br>Treating employees as people involves inevitably 
		the consideration of matters only remotely connected with their jobs. 
		Tangible demonstrations of this friendly concern with the physical, 
		social, and spiritual well-being o£ employees are legion. Provision of 
		comfortable and healthy working conditions carries over naturally to the 
		furnishing of free medical care and hospitalization for the employee and 
		his dependents, economical housing, recreational facilities, paid 
		vacations, and pensions.<br><br>&quot;We try to make our workers' lives worth 
		living&quot; was the simple explanation of one firm which had provided for 
		the welfare of employees in all these ways.<br><br>Another firm which 
		supported an exclusive country club for the recreation of its employees 
		and their families proclaimed: &quot;At the heart of our plan is the belief 
		that the healthy worker will out-produce the sickly one, and that a 
		happy worker will do more work and do it better, than a discontented 
		one'.'<br><br>Nor are these efforts to treat employees like people 
		confined to large and wealthy corporations. The small organization with 
		its intimate first-name relationships can and often does plan 
		extensively for its employees' welfare. A Canadian employer told his 
		vocational craft assembly at a Rotary convention how &quot;we organize our 
		workmen'.'<br><br>&quot;We have bowling leagues in the wintertime'/ he 
		stated, &quot;and we give a banquet for them at the end of the season. We 
		have picnics for them in the summertime. We have hockey games. Many of 
		them go fishing and they bring back pictures of their catch. We give a 
		prize for the biggest fish caught. They get a great kick out of it. You 
		have got to work for those fellows because they are working for you. Pay 
		them back in something besides coin, because coin won't buy everything 
		in this day and age!'<br><br>In a pamphlet called, &quot;Firm Foundations,&quot; 
		issued by the Rotary Club of Capetown, South Africa, small business is 
		advised how it can help its employees through savings plans, group 
		insurance, and the guarantee of loans. A medical-aid society in which 
		firms with only a few employees can participate was launched in 
		Rhodesia. And for those who may doubt Rotary's influence in vocational 
		service, it should be noted that the impetus for this scheme came from 
		the vocational service chairman of a Rotary club.<br><br>Employers who 
		like their workers and think of them as people do not lack inspiring 
		examples of tangible ways to express their sentiments. The list of 
		benefits and welfare projects is inexhaustible and, in some ways, 
		bewildering. Questions arise. Do employees appreciate what they are 
		getting? Are these costly gratuities justified in terms of heightened 
		morale, increased productivity, reduced labor turnover and less-frequent 
		absences from work? Or are these typical replies taken from a recent 
		poll of employees an indication that treating them like people may 
		sometimes misfire?<br><br>&quot;I thought the government paid for it!'<br>
		&quot;They take it out of our pay!'<br>&quot;I didn't even know there were such 
		benefits!'<br>&quot;It's paternalism!&quot;<br><br>Such comments are not at all 
		uncommon. As a response to a friendly gesture they are sometimes hard to 
		take. Yet they do illustrate the dangers inherent in all social 
		undertakings. That enlightened despot of Prussia who carried his concern 
		for his subjects' welfare so far that he went around dipping his linger 
		into their cooking pots to assure himself that they were getting the 
		right nourishment, is a warning to all of us. The self-conscious 
		philanthropist with &quot;an overpowering air of doing good&quot; is generally 
		resented and often suspected.<br><br>The mistakes of paternalism and all 
		its disappointments can he avoided if common sense is mixed in liberal 
		quantities with sentiment. A frank and objective recognition that the 
		money spent on these benefits could be added to the workers' pay may 
		lead to the decision that they should be consulted about the project 
		being planned. Or the individual employee can be left completely free to 
		decide without stigma to his reputation as a &quot;good fellow&quot; whether he 
		wants to participate in activities sponsored by the firm. In this way 
		the concept that &quot;employees are people&quot; can be stretched to include the 
		realization that they are &quot;persons&quot; too, with freedom of choice, and 
		therefore more likely to join in where they have complete liberty to 
		refuse.<br><br>On the other hand, enlightened self-interest should never 
		be masked under a spurious benevolence. General statistics show that 
		absenteeism costs as much as the average company's net profit. Labor 
		turnover in many plants runs as high as 50 per cent a year; and the cost 
		of recruitment, placement, and training, even of an unskilled worker, 
		averages close to a hundred dollars. Accordingly, there is ample 
		justification of expenditures that help to keep employees healthy in 
		mind and body, free from worry and happy in their jobs,. The benefits 
		that produce these results can often be made available to employees as a 
		group far more economically than they could be obtained individually. 
		Frank explanation of these facts to employees can help remove any 
		suspicion of paternalism.<br><br>Robots or human beings? In the last 
		analysis, is it not a question of self-esteem? Happy is the worker who 
		prides himself in the importance of his function. A Rotarian happened to 
		sit next to a passenger on the bus who seemed completely wrapped up in 
		his own thoughts. Every so often a <br>smile flitted across his face.<br>
		<br>&quot;You seem to be enjoying this ride, friend,&quot; the Rotarian ventured 
		to remark. The man started; then relaxed and smiled. &quot;I must have looked 
		silly,&quot; he said, &quot;but I have a good reason. I was just checking up on my 
		engine.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What do you mean, your engine?&quot; came back the Rotarian. 
		&quot;I though it belonged to the Blank Bus Company.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, sure,&quot; he 
		answered, &quot;but it's still my baby. I've just put in two solid days on 
		that power plant, and now listen to her, will you. Purring like a 
		contented cat. Look,&quot; he went on, &quot;I hammer and measure and grind and 
		adjust these motors for months at a time, and when I send them out on 
		the road, they're right! But the greatest enjoyment I get is when I sit 
		here with thirty other passengers and see how the bus performs. It gives 
		me a lift,&quot; said he, &quot;when I remember that the work I do in the shop is 
		safety insurance for hundreds of people who ride these buses.&quot;<br><br>In 
		what ways can a Rotarian employer help to revive the spirit of 
		craftsmanship?</td>
