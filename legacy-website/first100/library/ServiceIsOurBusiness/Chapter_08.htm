		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">COMMUNICATION is the magic mockery 
		that science makes of distance. Swift flight has brought any spot of the 
		globe within sixty hours' travel from &quot;our town&quot; The minds of men are 
		being linked across the planet by telephone, radio, and television while 
		a closely coordinated system of transport brings the loneliest farm 
		within the reach of civilization.<br><br>Through highly sensitive 
		devices, marvels of ingenuity and discipline, this conquest of distance 
		is achieved. Yet the conqueror himself, too often remains isolated in 
		spirit, aloof from his fellow-men, incapable of the most rudimentary 
		gesture or contact.<br><br>As we have seen, an essential element in 
		service consists in bridging the gulf created by self-interest. In the 
		case of a competitor, it meant going more than half-way in friendship. 
		Where customers were concerned, real communication was established 
		through the salesman's interest in their actual needs.<br><br>Not so 
		evident, however, is the need for dispelling the distance that authority 
		interposes in relations with employees. Subconsciously a distinction is 
		made between customers who are wooed with every sort of 
		consideration—and employees whose time, talents, and energies have been 
		purchased and brought under authority. According to the common 
		assumption, it is the employee's role to woo the favor of the man who 
		has hired him.<br><br>There is usually a half-truth in most common 
		assumptions that need not be denied while the whole truth is being 
		sought. Granting the authority of the employer—even in a period of acute 
		labor shortage—is it not true likewise that employees are just as vital 
		to the success of a business as customers? He profits most , . . whose 
		employees are alert, intelligent, and cooperative. It they are 
		lackadaisical clock watchers, their employer may be wasting as much as 
		fifty per cent of his annual payroll- If they are discontented and 
		rebellious, all the profit from his skillful organization may go with 
		the wind.<br><br>Once the employee is hired, moreover, there is a change 
		in the relationship. The employer ceases to be merely the purchaser of a 
		commodity. He becomes in some respects a salesman, with the employee in 
		the position of a customer who has to be &quot;sold&quot; on his job - instructed 
		and inspired to co-operate with a whole heart. Even though the employee 
		who proves unsatisfactory can be dismissed, his case is not so different 
		from that of a customer whose account is closed for one<br>reason or 
		another.<br><br>Much of the experience gained in relations with 
		customers can be applied in obtaining the best efforts from employees. 
		The first step is to overcome the distance imposed by authority. The 
		salesman finds that his primary function is to study the needs of his 
		customers and to place their interest in satisfactory service before his 
		own interest in profit. Customers respond favorably to such treatment, 
		and so do employees.<br><br>&quot;They act as though they wanted to give us a 
		break,” said the president of a trade-union in tribute to a company with 
		which he had been having difficult negotiations. &quot;We don't always win, 
		but no matter how big or how small the matter may be, they always 
		listen. You can't help liking guys who listen&quot;<br><br>The lack o£ easy 
		channels of communication is often an initial cause of many destructive 
		labor disputes that spread impoverishment far and wide. Inability to 
		listen is no less fatal in many small businesses where silent 
		frustration may be even more destructive of efficiency than open revolt. 
		Rotary in action would provide an open door to the boss's office, a 
		standing invitation to employees to come in and air their difficulties. 
		The president of a Rotary club in California suggests the following 
		points to remember '^when an employee is dissatisfied and comes to you 
		for an interview&quot;:<br><br>Listen, don't talk. Many things will work 
		themselves out when the employee is allowed to &quot;get it off his chest:'<br>
		<br>Don't argue.<br><br>Don't lecture. The employee feels cut off. 
		Lecturing blocks communication.<br><br>Pay attention to what he wants to 
		say and help him to express himself clearly.<br><br>Don't express moral 
		attitudes.<br><br>Don't let your emotions creep in.<br><br>Test your 
		understanding and at the same time stimulate further expression by 
		summarizing from time to time the employee's views.<br><br>The 
		employer's effort in all such interviews should be to help the employee 
		talk out his problem; to secure an understanding of the difficulty; and 
		to assist in finding a solution.<br><br>The precious time given to such 
		interviews will not be wasted if they result in a new awareness and 
		increased energy on the part of the employee. Without pretending to be 
		psychiatrists, employers need not ignore the fact that personality 
		problems often affect the efficiency of the worker. These may spring 
		from tangible worries ranging from sickness in the home to unpleasant 
		relations with a fellow-employee. Or, it may be some deep-seated 
		personal difficulty.<br><br>A doctor who has had much experience with 
		the impact of personality in factory work has classified these 
		maladjustments as arising from a number of causes: excessive 
		preoccupation with self, aggressive responses to things or persons in 
		the environment, aggressions turned inward (often resulting in 
		deliberate accidents, drunkenness, or self-induced failure) passively 
		dependent traits, and compensation for insecurity or inadequacy.<br><br>
		The employer who thinks he detects any of these maladjustments in his 
		employees may not be able to provide a complete solution. Knowledge of 
		their existence, however, may suggest changes in the kind of work the 
		employee is doing or perhaps association with different people.<br><br>
		Praise and blame arc two channels of communication open directly to the 
		employer because of his authority. Used positively, constructively, in 
		relation to performance of the job rather than to personality—both can 
		bring about a better relationship with employees. Blame, however 
		impersonal, may be depressing unless the recipient is very sure of his 
		ability to overcome the defect. Many employers accordingly prefer &quot;a 
		criticism sandwich&quot;—two slices of praise for things the employee is 
		actually accomplishing with one slice of blame in .between where 
		correction is desired or needed. In keeping blame impersonal, complete 
		privacy is almost essential, for spectators direct the employee's 
		attention toward himself and create a feeling of self-pity.<br><br>An 
		employer, moreover, who takes upon his own shoulders a generous share of 
		the blame for failures that have occurred not only avoids humiliating 
		the worker, but also discourages any tendency to “pass the buck” a habit 
		as infectious as it is harmful to the general morale of the business.<br>
		<br>Is there any substantial reason for the fear sometimes expressed 
		that such human consideration for the feelings of employees detracts 
		from the authority and dignity of the boss? Surely not. There is no 
		question here of &quot;coddling&quot; employees any more than might exist in a 
		similar concern for the feelings and complaints of customers. The same 
		Golden Rule impels you to treat employees as you would like to be 
		treated if you yourself were working at the bench or behind the counter.<br>
		<br>Each complaint provides an opportunity for achieving basic 
		improvements in the relationship. Rules that are infringed may need to 
		be explained or it may develop that they are not really necessary. 
		Employers are discovering constantly that the abolition of needless 
		restrictions is very helpful to employee morale, and that 
		self-discipline or group discipline by fellow-workers is just as 
		effective. A plant that dispensed with time-clocks and permitted the 
		employees to smoke, lunch, or rest when they chose, was rewarded by 
		increased output. Abuse of these privileges by individual workers was 
		roundly rebuked by fellow-workers. An &quot;honor-system&quot; shifted the burden 
		of unpleasant supervision to the employees themselves.<br><br>Another 
		valuable channel of communication is the encouragement of new ideas and 
		suggestions, A labor leader gave trenchant utterance to the need for 
		opening this channel. &quot;There never was a factory yet that came within 
		hailing distance of its fullest possible production',' he told his union 
		members. &quot;And it never will without you and you and you. You can see 
		things that management can't see. You can see the little wastes that add 
		up to the one great terrible waste. Management can't stop them. You can&quot;<br>
		<br>An employee should know the details of his job better than anyone 
		else. Certainly, he has a particular point of view and a special 
		interest in it. Ideas often occur to him that would escape anyone not so 
		closely identified with the work at hand. If he knows that his 
		suggestions are welcomed, carefully studied, and fairly rewarded—or, at 
		the least, recognized—he is likely to take a more intelligent attitude 
		toward his work.<br><br>A railroad has popularized the slogan, &quot;There is 
		no ceiling on new ideas&quot; In its advertising it boasts of the thousands 
		of dollars it has paid for valuable employee suggestions. No matter if 
		three-fourths of the ideas prove impractical—provided their authors are 
		told why—those that are adopted more than compensate for the trouble of 
		installing a suggestion system. The value of the by-products in general 
		keenness and sense of participation is inestimable. No concern is so 
		small that it cannot benefit from a system that employees know is fair 
		and efficient.<br><br>A broadening of this channel of communication has 
		been introduced by a Rotarian in what he calls &quot;multiple management&quot; In 
		his business, a revolving committee of employees considers suggestions 
		for improved efficiency with the single stipulation that they must 
		approve ideas unanimously before endorsing them- Very few of the 
		proposals endorsed by these committees have failed to receive prompt and 
		profitable application. In addition, there has been instilled throughout 
		the concern a spirit that could not be purchased at any price. As one 
		employee put it, &quot;I feel like I'm in business for myself with someone 
		else's money&quot;<br><br>One leading British company has a meeting every 
		three or four weeks with a group of employees whose names literally come 
		out of the hat and represent all departments. No minutes are taken and 
		the directors present give a guarantee that no employee will be 
		penalized in any way for anything he may say. Only one question is asked 
		by management: &quot;What's wrong with us, and how do you think we can 
		improve our management of the company?&quot;<br><br>The results are reported 
		to be immensely worth while, and the directors have gained a valuable 
		personal contact with large numbers of their workpeople by this means. 
		Great interest has been created in the progress and management of the 
		concern, and during the operation of the plan over a number of years 
		there have been no strikes.<br><br>Employees too often assume that 
		management knows little or nothing of their problems. However, a study 
		of the largest businesses in America showed that the starting wages of 
		the 143 men who are now top executives averaged $13.40 a week. Like the 
		vast majority of employers, these men started very near the bottom. Yet 
		to how many employees, is management away off somewhere in an ivory 
		tower?<br><br>Similarly, the wildest opinions often exist about the 
		extent of profit that is being taken from industry. One poll of workers 
		registered the belief that the owners took seventy-five per cent of the 
		gross receipts. Railroad employees guessed on the average that 
		stock-holders of their road received a twenty-seven per cent return on 
		their investment, whereas the actual dividends amounted to just three 
		per cent. Another poll of workers revealed that less than a quarter of 
		those polled had received any substantial information about the plans 
		and prospects, problems or profits of the concerns which employed them.<br>
		<br>Does not this failure to communicate, rather than any ambition on 
		the part of employees to usurp the functions of management, explain much 
		current discontent and unrest?<br><br>Many alternative channels exist 
		for dispelling this kind of ignorance. Some firms enclose in their pay 
		envelopes simple and graphic statements of their financial situation. 
		Others make such statements a part of the general information in house 
		organs which are distributed to employees and their families. Smaller 
		concerns may best convey this information through meetings of employers 
		with employees.<br><br>The object of such meetings should be to reduce 
		the distance imposed by authority; to impart the fervor that may be lost 
		in transmission through subordinates; and to face frankly the problems 
		and misunderstandings that disturb employees. The Rotarian who is able 
		to do this with simplicity and without, as one executive put it, “making 
		noises like a corporation” has not wasted his Rotary training.<br><br>In 
		many parts of the world, these meetings are organized permanently as a 
		&quot;works council&quot; in which representatives of the employees are invited to 
		discuss the problems and the progress of the business. British Rotarians 
		claim success in overcoming a suspicion among the workers that the works 
		council is &quot;just another dodge to pull the wool over their eyes.&quot; 
		Constant presence of the chief executive of the business at meetings of 
		the works council, alternating chairmanship between employees and 
		management, complete equality for all in candid expressions of opinion 
		are among the remedies for such feelings.<br><br>The scope of the idea 
		is indicated by its adaptation to the needs of natives engaged in 
		industry as reported by Rotarians in South Africa:<br><br>The eyes of 
		the world are focused on South Africa and its native policy more now 
		than at any time of its history. We must be progressive in our thoughts 
		on this issue generally although our specific interest is with the 
		native in our own industry.<br><br>The procedure for the establishment 
		of a native works council is simple in the extreme. Avoid a constitution 
		and do not bar discussion on any subject. Two or three members of the 
		management should be on the council with any number of Africans. Meet at 
		monthly intervals and never hesitate to call special meetings. Members 
		should hold office for twelve months and should not be elected on a 
		tribal basis.<br><br>Employees elect their own members to serve on the 
		works council. Sitting around a table with the chairman of the board of 
		directors, they hammer out all their difficulties, and often make 
		valuable suggestions for the betterment of the firm.<br><br>I can 
		honestly say that the effect of these works councils has been most 
		marked, and not in one instance has it failed to prevent employees going 
		out on strike.<br><br>To give all employees a clear picture of the 
		council's work, Rotarians recommend publication of the full minutes of 
		its meetings. A booklet issued by one firm under the title of, What It 
		Has Done, credited the council with first-rate ideas on production, the 
		reduction of absenteeism, and the creation of a more friendly atmosphere 
		in the plant.<br><br>Besides being prolific in valuable suggestions for 
		improved efficiency, works councils often concern themselves with the 
		general welfare and health of employees, savings and benefit funds, 
		improvements in safety, or projects for entertainment and education. 
		Above all, they contribute to a feeling of responsibility and 
		self-respect in every worker by giving him a sense of belonging to the 
		&quot;team.&quot;<br><br>Meetings with employees also provide the best atmosphere 
		for communicating the ideals of vocational service. This good thing 
		should be shared. It a Rotarian keeps Rotary to himself as a private 
		cult, he is missing much of his opportunity to serve society. The daily 
		incidents of business furnish him with admirable illustrations for 
		arousing in his associates the realization that &quot;they also serve.&quot; It 
		will interest them to know why he goes each week to his Rotary meeting, 
		what he gets there, and how it affects them. No better bridge could be 
		constructed for human relations than the explanation by an employer of 
		his own adventure in service. And how thrilling to his employees would 
		be his invitation to comradeship in this adventure.<br><br>&quot;They also 
		server The eagerness of employees to share, richly and deeply, the aims 
		which Rotary brings to business, has been amply demonstrated. Here, for 
		instance, is the experience of a Rotarian who employs a total of seven 
		persons. One day, he called all seven of them together, told them 
		something of the vocational service program of Rotary and then presented 
		to each of them a copy of &quot;Service is My Business&quot; with the suggestion 
		that he would like to have them read the book at their convenience.<br>
		<br>Only Sam, an old negro who had worked many years as a general 
		handyman did not get a copy, for he had never learned to read. A copy 
		was presented, however, to Sam's son who worked part-time in the store.<br>
		<br>A few days later, the Rotarian heard that Sam had asked his son to 
		read the book aloud to him. Questioned about it, Sam replied: &quot;Yassuh, 
		we not only read it through once, but we has almost finished it twiced.&quot;<br>
		<br>&quot;Did you, indeed? Well, just what does the book mean to you?&quot;<br>
		<br>&quot;Why, suh,&quot; replied Sam, &quot;I got this much out of it; it don't make 
		no difference how good those manufacturers make those drugs we got here 
		in the store or how good they make those oxygen tents, if ol' Sam don't 
		get them delivered to the right place and in time, they aren't goin' to 
		be worth nothin' at all.&quot;<br><br>What are you doing to make your 
		employees aware of the purposes of Rotary?</td>
