		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">A Basis for Agreement<br><br>once, 
		it is told, the workers of ancient Rome arose and went on strike. 
		Declaring that they would no longer toil for their masters, they 
		withdrew to a nearby hill. Rome was paralyzed, and the patricians waited 
		apprehensively as Menenius Agrippa went to persuade the strikers to 
		return. He told them this fable: &quot;The members of the human body once 
		mutinied against the belly and accused it of lying idle and useless 
		while they were all laboring and toiling to satisfy its appetites. But 
		the belly only laughed at the simplicity of those who knew not that 
		though it received all the nourishment into itself, it prepared and 
		distributed it again to all parts of the body.&quot;<br><br>Just so, said 
		Agrippa, stands the case between the employers and the strikers. He won 
		his case. But the argument has continued to this day. Millions of 
		man-days of production and billions in wages are lost through strikes. 
		Incalculable injury is suffered by others. Shortages and rising prices 
		caused by strikes stoke the fires of inflation and add to the threat of 
		depression and dictatorship.<br><br>Yet, the real nature of the crisis 
		in labor relations is not revealed by detailing its disastrous 
		consequences. Strikes are like a thermometer which indicates that the 
		boiling-point has been reached. They disclose the situation. They are 
		not the situation itself. Just as you cannot reduce the temperature of a 
		room by applying an ice-bag to the thermometer, so making strikes 
		difficult will not relieve the tensions of industry. You have to get the 
		temperature down by finding the cause of the excessive heat and removing 
		it.<br><br>Surely Rotary should have some answer to the problem of labor 
		conflict. The interest of its members as business and professional men 
		is involved. Their influence is not inconsiderable. The deeper relation 
		of the crisis to the personal attitudes of workers and employers 
		challenges their professed ideals.<br><br>It may be helpful at the 
		outset to dispose of the defeatist notion that the conflict is 
		inevitable. This notion stems directly from the interpretation of 
		history as a class struggle proposed by Karl Marx, though it is often 
		shared by people very far from being Marxists. Whoever assumes that 
		workers are concerned only with getting the most pay for the least work 
		or that employers have no other thought but profit, consciously or 
		unconsciously, subscribes to the doctrine of Marxian materialism. On 
		this basis alone does conflict between them seem irreconcilable.<br><br>
		Nor is the idea of inevitable conflict any longer supported by the 
		modern biologist who has abandoned the Darwinian description of &quot;nature, 
		red in tooth and claw&quot; in favor of one that attributes the survival of 
		species to co-operation. &quot;Co-operate or die&quot; is the law of life, 
		according to Professor Alice writing on Animal Sociology in the 
		Encyclopedia Britannica.<br><br>Discredited theories die hard. There is 
		a time-lag before they are abandoned. Repudiated in principle, the 
		theory of the class struggle often survives in practice and crops out in 
		the strangest places. How many employers, for instance, approach the 
		bargaining table as rigidly determined to battle for their class rights 
		as the most impassioned agitator. The single thought of both parties to 
		the dispute is the desire to dominate.<br><br>The desire to dominate 
		lies at the very heart of the system that produces strikes. Where each 
		party is out to win, to impose his will upon the other, to prescribe his 
		own solution whatever discouragement or frustration it may cause - 
		conflict is indeed inevitable. Even if the weakness of one party 
		prevents open strife, a sullen spirit of resentment sours the 
		relationship. The cooperation essential to survival becomes impossible. 
		What degree of efficiency or initiative or loyalty could an employer 
		expect who dominated his employees without regard to their welfare or 
		respect for their rights? <br><br>Domination rarely succeeds in any kind 
		of a situation. In a labor dispute, the result is usually a compromise. 
		Each side renounces a part of its aim to dominate when the struggle has 
		become too painful. This kind of solution is often hailed as a victory 
		for moderation, and such it may be. But too often it represents merely 
		reluctant concession and appeasement in the worst sense. Its 
		consequences may be no less disastrous than the choice of the man 
		cycling home after dark along a country road. He saw two lights coming 
		toward him. &quot;Sure, and I'll steer between them',' he said. Unfortunately 
		they were the lights of a truck. Too often a compromise merely confirms 
		the will to dominate eventually. It encourages stubbornness and 
		insincerity. The sterile issue of much haggling, it leaves both 
		combatants with the feeling that they have been beaten and with the 
		determination to renew the struggle when they have gathered new 
		strength.<br><br>Obsessed by the conviction that conflict is inevitable, 
		employers and employees and their representatives ignore completely the 
		possibility of an alternative procedure to one based on the desire to 
		dominate and ending in compromise. Yet a definite and distinct 
		alternative does exist, and with it the chance for leadership out of the 
		barren wilderness of labor strife.<br><br>The key word is combination. 
		It describes a procedure which seeks to absorb the conflicting interests 
		in an overriding common interest.<br><br>One such common interest might 
		be simply a mutual recognition that conflict is costly and sterile. 
		Everyone loses in a strike. Or it might be the common fear of both 
		parties that their conflict would lead to govern­ment controls and 
		bureaucratic interference equally distasteful to employers and unions. 
		These negative interests, however, do not point to any particular 
		solution. They do not release the energies which conflict diverts from 
		the useful side of life. A common interest that was positive, rather 
		than negative, would have greater creative force.<br><br>A British 
		industrialist, Sir George Schuster, formulated such a positive basis for 
		agreement when he told the London Rotary Club that &quot;the goal of both 
		labor and management should be to increase the size of the cake rather 
		than quarrel over how it should be divided'.' Increased individual 
		productivity, lower prices, and expanded sales were the positive goals 
		that he suggested.<br><br>Still more comprehensive as a basis for 
		agreement is the formula expressed in the concluding words of the second 
		phase of Rotary's Object - &quot;service to society'.' Translated into 
		practical and specific proposals for any given business or industry, 
		these words are revolutionary in their import. They suggest that instead 
		of basing their demands on near-sighted selfish considerations, labor - 
		and management, too - should relate them to a common interest in 
		expanding business, higher living standards, and general prosperity.<br>
		<br>Would the intractable problems, the sullen discontents, the 
		accumulated bitterness that have encompassed labor conflict, yield to 
		such an approach? Could tough-minded, horse-trading negotiators be 
		persuaded to try it instead of retracing with hopeless doggedness the 
		dreary paths of domination and compromise? How much persuasive skill 
		would be required to convince cynical or obdurate minds that this 
		inspirational phrase - &quot;service to society&quot; - offers real hope, not 
		merely for preventing strikes but for impairing a new spirit of real 
		co-operation? There is no foretelling until the attempt has been made.<br>
		<br>Rotarians who decide to make the experiment, whether in a store with 
		half a dozen employees or in a factory with several hundred, whether in 
		negotiation with previously estranged labor leaders or in conversation 
		with the new girl at the notion counter - will be aware that they are 
		attempting something of great significance.<br><br>Each problem will 
		invoke a different style of approach. But in every case, three steps are 
		essential:<br><br>(1) The basis of agreement - &quot;service to society&quot; - 
		must be explained and perhaps rephrased to convey all its implications 
		in concrete, tangible terms so that the individual employee or labor 
		representative will see clearly his relation to it. At the same time, 
		the Rotarian will frankly set forth what he conceives to be his own 
		relation to this common interest.<br><br>(2) The special interests of 
		both parties must be considered in the light of the common interest. All 
		the cards must be laid on the table. There should be no shrinking from 
		the fighting words, the belligerently expressed demands, nor suppression 
		of any accumulated grievances and mistrust. But once these have been 
		stated, both parties should try to re-evaluate them in terms of &quot;service 
		to society.&quot;<br><br>This critical step in the procedure calls for a 
		little elaboration. The aim is to find out what each party really wants, 
		and to see how these private goals can be reconciled with the common 
		goal. Suppose, for instance, a dispute in which the workers demanding 
		increased take-home pay are met with the objection that the employer has 
		to make a profit in a competitive market. Break down this demand and 
		this objection in terms of what each party really wants. Translate those 
		real wants in terms of &quot;service to society'.' Compare them. Could they 
		not be reconciled? Combined? Almost identified?<br><br>the employees 
		really want—<br><br>A fair day's pay<br><br>Security<br><br>Real 
		incentives<br><br>Recognition<br><br>A share in policy-making<br><br>the 
		employer really wants— A fair day's work Loyalty and goodwill Increased 
		productivity Initiative and ideas A fair return on investment<br><br>Are 
		not these the real wants that underlie the haggling over wages and 
		hours, welfare funds, vacations with pay, and a thousand other issues? 
		Are they not quite reasonable and honest desires that can be 
		satisfied—not compromised—through a common agreement of service to 
		society?<br><br>(3) The procedure is not complete without action. 
		Agreement on a common goal, the most satisfying talk, will only end in 
		disillusionment if tangible results do not follow quickly. The extent of 
		the action is dependent on many circumstances, but its nature should be 
		such as to reveal plainly the reconciliation of the separate interests 
		of the parties to the agreement. Immediate action—looking forward to 
		continued action—is an earnest of good faith.<br><br>Rotarians who 
		undertake these three steps as an alternative to the procedure of 
		domination and compromise can expect results only over a period. This 
		application of Rotary is a slow process. It extends far beyond the 
		immediate crisis produced by strikes until it embraces all 
		employer-employee relations.<br><br>What specific contributions 
		Rotarians and Rotary clubs can make to develop this much-needed 
		understanding is something for individual determination. That the spirit 
		of &quot;service to society&quot; is already at home in the labor relations of 
		many Rotarians is apparent. Yet the idea could be expressed more openly 
		and directly. Even in the smallest business it could become the theme 
		for discussion at meetings with employees. Even professional men could 
		give currency to the idea by frankly presenting it to competitors, 
		colleagues, or clients as a basis for agreement. Through education, 
		influence, and example, the opportunity existing everywhere for 
		&quot;combined operations&quot; could provide a powerful antitoxin to the 
		prevailing class conflict.<br><br>A special opportunity exists in 
		relation to trade-union leaders. Like the men whose vocation is 
		management, these professional trade-unionists are sensitive to any 
		threat against their own particular status and prerogative. There is 
		nothing discreditable in this. It is perfectly natural. When labor 
		leaders express a zeal to share in managerial functions, when management 
		through interest in human engineering seeks ways to win greater 
		efficiency, the other party is likely to exclaim: &quot;Production? Service? 
		Yes, but not over my dead body!&quot;<br><br>Anyone who feels professionally 
		insecure is likely to look around for ways to stress the importance of 
		his function. The employer does this, sometimes, by means of distance 
		and secrecy. Let no one penetrate the &quot;holy of holies&quot; where he is 
		mystically managing to meet the payroll on Saturday night. The 
		trade-union executive, on the other hand, may feel impelled to justify 
		his position by assuming the role of an Oliver Twist. His prerogatives 
		will be respected by dues-paying members so long as he is continually 
		&quot;asking for more.&quot; No sooner has he negotiated one set of labor gains 
		than he begins to hint about the next series of demands. How else is he 
		to justify his existence?<br><br>Would it not contribute enormously to 
		the professional security of the trade-union executive if a Rotarian 
		employer would invite him to general consultation on their respective 
		roles as seen in the light of &quot;service to society&quot;? In the course of 
		consultation, the opportunity for combined operations between them could 
		be explored. As partners, rather than rivals, each could benefit. Or a 
		Rotary club at one of its meetings could present a trade-union leader 
		with the same question, and work out with him a program for expanding 
		this project throughout the labor movement. Or the same club might 
		consider the possibility of filling the classification officially 
		described as &quot;Labor Organizations&quot; with an intelligent and statesmanlike 
		representative who would make it his business to promote combined 
		operations.<br><br>Who can tell what may be the wide repercussions from 
		such contacts. Eight years ago, the vocational service committee in 
		Auckland, New Zealand invited two trade unionists to attend its meeting. 
		They came hesitatingly, but enjoyed the discussion and brought several 
		of their colleagues to subsequent meetings. The upshot was the formation 
		of a labor-management group which prepared a joint statement of 
		principles similar to those which have been considered here.<br><br>In 
		1951, a very serious situation arose on the waterfront of Auckland. A 
		strike threatened to become an attempt to overthrow constitutional 
		government. Police measures could not deal with the disorders, but the 
		attempt failed because responsible union leaders, many of them members 
		of this group inspired by Rotary, were able to convince the rank and 
		file of the employer's sincerity. It was their own conviction obtained 
		through personal acquaintance and experience. <br><br>Has your club 
		considered the possibility of inviting a trade unionist to become a 
		member?</td>
