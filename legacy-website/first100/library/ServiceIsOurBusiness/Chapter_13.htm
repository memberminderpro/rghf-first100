		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">Operation Rotary Club<br><br>at 
		the beginning of this book, vocational service was deemed as an 
		obligation of each member of a Rotary club to SHARE the ideal of Rotary 
		with non-Rotarians he meets or contacts in his business or profession. 
		Viewed in this light, the opportunities for practical, down to earth 
		activities in vocational service are legion. Many of the ways in which 
		the individual Rotarian is challenged to share Rotary in his own 
		business and professional life have already been illustrated. It remains 
		to suggest the scope for club and committee work.<br><br>Recommendations 
		by the program planning committee of Rotary International for the 
		observance of the Golden Anniversary in 1955 contained no less than 
		fifty specific and distinct activities for clubs to undertake in 
		vocational service. These by no means exhaust the possibilities. The 
		experience and procedures of many successful vocational service projects 
		are available on request from the secretariat of Rotary International, 
		1600 Ridge Avenue, Evanston, Illinois, U.S.A. With these resources, any 
		club anywhere can expect its vocational service committee to develop a 
		thorough plan that will stimulate each and every member to fulfill his 
		obligation of sharing Rotary in his business or profession.<br><br>The 
		club meeting is a natural setting for this plan. Programs by the 
		vocational service chairmen responsible for employee, competitor, 
		buyer-seller, trade associations, and Four-Way Test activities can point 
		out to members their opportunities for sharing in these fields. The 
		&quot;classification talk&quot; traditional in Rotary only fulfills its purpose if 
		the member making it explains just how he is making the influence of 
		Rotary felt in his business or profession. Sometimes that purpose is 
		achieved by having the talk made by a fellow member who has made an 
		investigation of his practices. Several short dramatizations of 
		vocational service problems are available to spark discussion at the 
		club meeting.<br><br>Experience proves, however, that coming to grips 
		with these problems requires more time than the program at the club 
		meeting affords. The leisurely and informal gathering of a small group 
		in the home of a member is better for exchanging ideas about actual 
		situations and for formulating plans of action. Some two hundred 
		vocational service committees in the British Isles, for instance, have 
		been studying how Rotary can help to increase productivity in factory 
		and office. An alternative supplement to the club program is the club 
		forum on vocational service. Typical was the experience of a district 
		governor in Argentina who designated host clubs and leaders, issued 
		invitations and outlined topics for discussion. A number of these forums 
		were so successful that their practical results were recorded in a 
		widely distributed pamphlet.<br><br>Another stimulating experience 
		developed sometimes on the district level or by groups of clubs is the 
		Rotary Business Relations Conference. Leaders in different fields of 
		vocational service interest give expert advice, both publicly and 
		privately, to large gatherings of Rotarians. So valuable have these 
		conferences proved that one district has continued to hold them for 
		fifteen years. Three such conferences dealing particularly with the 
		situation of the aging worker were presented by another district 
		governor.<br><br>So far the types of sharing considered have been the 
		kind that inform and stimulate Rotarians to action in their individual 
		business and professional lives. The Rotary club can also provide direct 
		assistance to such actions. This book and The Four-Way Test are tools 
		for sharing the concept that &quot;service is my business&quot; with non-Rotarians 
		in all the relationships of business or profession. They provide bridges 
		that the Rotarian can use in communicating to employees, competitors, 
		customers or suppliers his desire for a new understanding and the 
		standards by which he would like all transactions to be measured. 
		Translated in many languages, The Four-Way Test is available in several 
		styles for distribution. Small folders telling its story can be 
		circularized to customers. Posters proclaim it as the measurement &quot;of 
		the things we think, say or do&quot; in office or mill. Desk plaques remind 
		executives or professional men to govern each decision by what they know 
		in their own hearts is right.<br><br>Some clubs make a survey of the 
		vocational service activities and problems of their members by means of 
		a questionnaire. A vocational service clinic is then established to 
		extend in new directions the practices which local experience has 
		approved. A great number of club meetings are designated as competitor 
		and employee days to help members improve these relationships. One club 
		in Australia holds an annual picnic for members, employees and their 
		families. Reminiscent of the practice which gave Rotary its name are 
		visits by clubs to the plants, stores or offices of members. A vivid 
		impression of Rotary can be given to employees of these concerns on such 
		&quot;Rotation Days.&quot;<br><br>Still another sphere of operation for the Rotary 
		club and its vocational service committee is the sharing of the Rotary 
		ideal with the community at large. There is no home town so blessed that 
		its people cannot be inspired to better living by the vision of &quot;service 
		is my business.&quot; It may be that a labor-management group or a courtesy 
		contest as described earlier would fill a need. Or perhaps the sights of 
		local salespeople could be raised by the sponsoring of a school for 
		salesmanship. To dramatize the worthiness of all useful occupations, 
		Rotary clubs in Japan and elsewhere have featured periodic tributes to 
		postal employees, telephone operators and street-cleaners. Wider public 
		understanding of Rotary aims in business and profession can be developed 
		by a town-meeting or a discussion by members over the radio or 
		television.<br><br>&quot;Service,&quot; as has been said, &quot;is always a 
		contribution to the future.&quot; There is no more universal opportunity for 
		vocational service than the early training of youth, the new generation 
		of employees and leaders, to habits of right thinking and doing. What 
		more glorious accomplishment could any vocational service committee hope 
		to achieve than a thorough job of persuading the young people of their 
		town to use The Four-Way Test?<br><br>A survey of vocational service 
		around the world shows it assuming a variety of forms adapted to local 
		needs. In one country, Rotarians may be found corn-batting the black 
		market with personal approaches to leading dealers requesting them to 
		display prices and price-lists. Here, the Rotary club organized an 
		exhibit of thirty-five local industries. There, a code of practices is 
		drawn up and adopted by local merchants or the vocational service 
		committee is instrumental in bringing about an amicable settlement of 
		labor trouble in local factories.<br><br>Important is the reference of 
		vocational service projects to an actual need of the local situation. 
		Equally important is the keenness of the local Rotarians who recognize 
		the need and their own obligation to do something about it. In every 
		club that deserves the name of Rotary, there must be some members 
		prepared to take this initiative, for without vocational service in 
		active operation Rotary has lost its meaning and mission. It may be the 
		chairman of the vocational service committee whose enthusiasm provides 
		the spark, or it may be someone else.<br><br>Just how this happens is 
		illustrated in the account of one committee meeting in South Africa. 
		&quot;The discussion had drifted into abstract generalities,&quot; the chairman 
		recalled, &quot;when a member burst forth with the demand that we get down to 
		cases. He then proceeded to outline an actual problem that he was facing 
		in his own business. Here in the friendly atmosphere of Rotary was a man 
		ready to open his heart, to put all his cards on the table, and to seek 
		advice and counsel from his friends. In a flash, the committee saw the 
		meaning of vocational service. The exchange of experiences that followed 
		sounded the keynote for a year's program.&quot;<br><br>Perhaps the 
		consideration of &quot;Service is My Business&quot; by a group in your club would 
		provoke this en­tanglement of Rotary aspirations with the reality of 
		conditions in your town. One thing suggests another. The actual 
		experiences recorded here may not exactly duplicate your experience, but 
		they may bring to mind the opportunities for sharing Rotary that exist 
		in your town as they do everywhere. <br><br>Which project in vocational 
		service would prompt members of your club to put Rotary to work where 
		they work? </td>
