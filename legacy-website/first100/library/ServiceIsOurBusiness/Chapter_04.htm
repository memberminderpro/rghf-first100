		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">IN ancient Damascus—the &quot;pearl of 
		the desert&quot;—was the tamed Street of the Sword makers. Here, in one 
		corner of the oldest inhabited city in the world, lived a guild of 
		artificers, and here they produced the famous blades of Damascus.<br>
		<br>These blades were so keen that you could cut a floating thread of 
		silk with them; so elastic that they would bend almost double and then 
		spring back as straight as ever.<br><br>Death—death by strangling—the 
		most shameful punishment of the time—was the sentence passed on any 
		member of the craft found guilty of producing an interior product, 
		because:<br><br>He did place the proof mark of our most honored and 
		trusted craft upon badly smithed and evily tempered blades which, having 
		failed in the hand of the purchaser, brought great disrepute upon all 
		the master sword makers of Damascus.<br><br>It was as if each sword bore 
		the fingerprints of its creator, a projection of his personality. And it 
		is doubtful if these early craftsmen were entirely inspired by concern 
		for the unlucky purchaser who might trust his life to a blade which had 
		a defect that the eye of man could not detect. Rather they were 
		motivated by a sense of indignation that their skill might be 
		questioned.<br><br>When a Rotary club is formed, the first consideration 
		is to secure as members, outstanding representatives of every worthy and 
		recognized business and professional activity in the community. The same 
		thought directs the selection of new members. They must be successful, 
		that is, they must be skilled in their respective crafts. Their 
		integrity must be above suspicion. They must be dedicated to the idea of 
		supporting and improving the standards of their craft. Indeed, a Rotary 
		club might well be described as an assembly of skilled craftsmen.<br>
		<br>Unlike the ancient guilds, however, the Rotary club is not organized 
		to safeguard and hoard the knowledge of particular skills. On the 
		contrary, the Rotary club is dedicated to the task of extending the 
		service which all skills can render to society.<br><br>The Rotary club, 
		moreover, which selects its membership from different trades and 
		professions contrasts in that respect with the ancient guilds which 
		associated men of the same craft. A closer comparison might be drawn 
		with the modern trade-union except that the guild was built around 
		employers rather than employees. It would seem that the nearest thing to 
		a modern guild is the trade association whose membership largely 
		comprises employers of the same business or craft, many of whom are 
		direct competitors.<br><br>The absence of competitors in Rotary clubs in 
		order to include a cross-section of all business and professional 
		activities in the community entails certain obligations. One of these 
		was expressed by the board of directors of Rotary International when it 
		enjoined Rotarians that they &quot;should not expect, and far less should 
		they ask for, more consideration or advantages from fellow-Rotarians 
		than the latter would give to any other business man with whom he has 
		business relations;' Any abuse of friendship for profit is foreign to 
		the spirit of Rotary, In other words, free competition is a blessing 
		that Rotary clubs are designed to foster.<br><br>Another and more 
		positive obligation of the Rotarian is to carry the message and ideals 
		of Rotary into his business relations with competitors. As a trustee of 
		his classification each member is regarded as an ambassador to his craft 
		and urged to participate actively in the work of his trade association. 
		This obligation was stated very forcibly by the chairman of one 
		vocational service committee addressing the members of his club:<br><br>
		It is my duty as the spokesman for the vocational service committee, my 
		fellow-Rotarians, to say to you in all earnestness and candor, that 
		unless you are carrying back to your craft, your trade association, or 
		your professional group the ideals, the precepts, and the high standards 
		embodied in Rotary, you should resign. You say that you are not inclined 
		to bother about your competitor, that you are too busy with your own 
		affairs to be concerned with what the other fellow is doing, that you 
		are not inclined to take on the responsibilities of leadership in your 
		line of business. I am sorry. The membership committee made a mistake 
		when they let you in. Those who fail in their duty to properly represent 
		their line of business or profession choke up one of the arteries 
		through which the lifeblood of Rotary flows.<br><br>The Rotarian who is 
		putting his shoulder to the wheel in his trade association derives many 
		advantages. Not the least of these is goodwill. A striking demonstration 
		of this advantage was given in the course of a radio program on 
		vocational service, broadcast from one small-town station. The work of 
		medical associations was cited as the reason why doctors are regarded 
		almost automatically as valuable citizens. Because his association has 
		established minimum standards of education, enforced codes of correct 
		practice, provided for the exchange of new methods and discoveries, the 
		individual doctor has a long start in earning a place of respect 
		wherever he may locate.<br><br>The practical benefits that small 
		business gains from membership were interestingly illustrated by a 
		tailor called upon to explain the value of his trade association in a 
		Rotary meeting. Looking back over a generation of business dealings in 
		his town, he found that general wages had increased five times while the 
		price of tailoring had only gone up three times. It was at the meetings 
		of his trade association that he and his competitors had exchanged the 
		&quot;know-how&quot; which had enabled them to increase the efficiency of 
		custom-tailoring so that competition from &quot;ready-to-wear&quot; clothes could 
		be met.<br><br>With the viewpoint of an outsider, an Australian Rotarian 
		expressed his amazement on observing the discussions of a meat-packers' 
		conference in Chicago. The domestic problems of individual plants were 
		discussed before assembled competitors in a wholehearted and unreserved 
		way. Besides raising the general level of the industry, these 
		discussions proved that in a meeting of twenty men, any one individual 
		stands to learn more from the other nineteen, than they in turn could 
		learn from him. Yet in the commercial field, away from the conference, 
		the Australian visitor found that these same men were engaged in the 
		most vigorous competition which acted as a salutary stimulus to 
		increased efficiency and the elimination of waste.<br><br>The advantage 
		of belonging to the trade association being fairly obvious, it may be 
		asked, what particularly is the Rotarian's contribution.<br><br>The 
		indication that a larger proportion of Rotarians belong to their craft 
		associations in towns under 12,000 than in the larger cities shows how 
		much the small business man has to gain from the ideas and improvements 
		in practice made current by the trade association. But what can the 
		Rotarian himself, coming from a small town and operating a small 
		business, contribute to the work of these large and impressive bodies?<br>
		<br>A Canadian Rotarian responded to this question by recalling a 
		childhood experience:<br><br>As a very small boy, I attended a rural 
		school. There was one good-natured lad, not particularly clever, and 
		with no particular gifts of leadership. The older boys were a tough and, 
		in some ways, quite a vicious crowd. They used to tease this fellow 
		unmercifully, but through it all, he preserved his good nature and 
		steadfastly refused to deviate from his standards of conduct. The 
		contrast of his good-humored determination had a tremendous influence. 
		It's the same way in trade associations. Without the influence and 
		exertions of sincere individuals, a cynical minority can accomplish much 
		mischief.<br><br>The great statesman-author, Edmund Burke, once declared 
		that &quot;When bad men combine, the good must associate, else they will fall 
		one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle&quot; Rotarians 
		combined can exercise a potent influence for good in their trade 
		associations if they inject the larger vision of opportunity to serve 
		society and the realization that only so far as the public is served can 
		trade associations serve their own best interests.<br><br>That there is 
		need for Rotary leaven in the practices of many trade associations was 
		vigorously asserted during a discussion at one craft assembly at a 
		convention of Rotary International. Too often it was charged, trade 
		associations, instead of putting service ahead of profit, degenerate 
		into pressure groups, conspiracies to circumvent government regulations, 
		and merchandising corporations to control prices. Rotarians were urged 
		to join forces against these tendencies and to support vigorously their 
		association code.<br><br>An outstanding contribution of Rotary to the 
		strength of the modern &quot;guild&quot; has been the development of codes of 
		correct practices. In fact, it is generally recognized that the 
		widespread movement by trade associations to adopt these voluntary 
		commitments, sprang largely from the thought and effort of vocational 
		service in Rotary. The results of this experience in drafting codes can 
		be summarized briefly as follows:<br><br>(1) The code is not a law, but 
		an expression of the determination of members in the association to 
		maintain certain standards.<br><br>(2) These standards are stated 
		positively and specifically as evolved from the experience of the 
		particular business or profession.<br><br>(3) Example and friendly 
		influence are the only ways by which the code is enforced.<br><br>The 
		value of a code to a trade or profession depends largely on the 
		fulfillment of these conditions. If it is limited to generalities, if it 
		is out of date, if it is used only to adorn the wall or hidden away in 
		files; it might as well or better not exist. The inspiration and labor 
		which brought its adoption by the trade association may have been 
		educational at the time when it was formulated, but now it no longer 
		serves.<br><br>What finer opportunity for effective work in vocational 
		service is offered than the methodical exploration of the status of 
		codes?<br><br>Each member of a Rotary club might be asked to produce the 
		code of his trade association for the purpose of critical comparison. In 
		cases where no code exists or where the existing code consists of 
		generalities or obsolete references, members may be persuaded to take 
		action in their trade associations to repair the omission. In this great 
		work, they should seek the whole-hearted co-operation of Rotarians in 
		their classification from other clubs who belong to the association. 
		They can obtain much helpful guidance in these efforts from Rotary 
		International.<br><br>Even those members of the club whose trade 
		association can boast of an adequate code of correct practices have a 
		task to perform. They can take steps to make sure that its standards are 
		observed in their own business or professional practice, as a training 
		manual for employees, by spreading its influence among customers and 
		suppliers, and by references to it at meetings of the trade association 
		to revive its authority among their competitors. Thus they may help to 
		spur the development of a new sense of craftsmanship in these modem 
		guilds. Thus they may repay the debt which, in the words of Bacon, each 
		man owes to his profession.<br><br>Because the great influence of Rotary 
		is formulating codes of correct practices for trade associations was at 
		its peak some forty years ago, there may be a tendency to assume that 
		this kind of work no longer needs doing. Emphatically, such is not the 
		case. A famous instance of price-fixing in the American electrical 
		industry stimulated one Rotarian recently to take action on a broad 
		scale. He was a past director of Rotary International and happened also 
		to be United States Secretary of Commerce. From this strategic position, 
		he inspired a movement to inject fresh vitality and increased 
		sensitivity into the thinking of business and professions about ethical 
		responsibilities.<br><br>Trade associations were only one sector of his 
		campaign. While they were urged to take steps to ensure that their codes 
		were more than just &quot;window dressing,&quot; the national Business Ethics 
		Advisory Council published a call for action addressed to American 
		businessmen as individuals. To help them analyze the ethical level of 
		their own practices the appeal included a series of probing questions. 
		Further influence was exerted through &quot;committees of one hundred&quot; that 
		united leaders in all walks of life to work down through individual 
		industries to individual firms. The first of these committees, organized 
		by Rotarians in Portland, Oregon, U.S.A., offers to share its experience 
		with others forming similar groups.<br><br>Another recent development in 
		the story of codes comes from Sweden where a Rotarian is director of a 
		nationwide watchmen service. He discovered a need to help his employees 
		&quot;raise their pride in their work, their regard for its honor, and their 
		interest in the body they belong to.&quot; Instead of establishing rules for 
		them to follow, however, he devised a process by which the watchmen 
		discussed the specific problems of their occupation and worked out their 
		own rules. Small groups of watchmen around the country met to talk about 
		the situations that really concerned them. Reports from all these groups 
		were gathered and sent back to them for further discussion. Eventually, 
		representatives from all the groups attended a two-day conference at 
		which a code of twenty rules was adopted. Signed by all the 
		representatives, this code was presented to all employees of the company 
		as something they had hammered out from their own experience. Since 
		then, every new employee gets a thorough explanation of the code from an 
		older colleague.<br><br>Obviously, such a procedure could be followed 
		much more easily yet with no less heartening results in a business or 
		professional institution where associates are in daily contact with each 
		other. Observers of this instance from Sweden &quot;were astonished, touched 
		and delighted with the strong notions of honor clearly shown by the 
		watchmen. Discussions were lively and provided a great number of varied, 
		often puzzling examples, but unanimity was reached eventually on a great 
		many important points.&quot;<br><br>What action can you take personally to 
		raise ethical standards in your business or profession?</td>
