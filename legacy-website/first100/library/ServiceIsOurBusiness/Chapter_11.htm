		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">What an amazing world this would 
		be if everyone could be convinced suddenly that “service is my 
		business.” The discontents and the discord would melt away. The 
		mountainous problems that hamper production and distribution would 
		become soluble. Teamwork would replace suspicion and frustration. 
		Imagine a factory, an office, or a retail store where everyone lived 
		vocational service, spontaneously and without affection, as a natural 
		way of living. What a pleasure to be associated in any way, as a 
		competitor or a customer, with such an institution !<br><br>Rotarians 
		who consider seriously the possibility of helping to realize this dream 
		are well aware of the difficulties. They recognize them as they exist in 
		their own personalities and in those with whom they seek to co-operate. 
		Selfishness—prejudice—fear—are built into so many of us by harsh 
		experience, perhaps, or by early training. However we got that way, it 
		makes it very difficult for us to live consistently as if service were 
		our business.<br><br>But, if we really want to realize this dream, it 
		would seem that the most hopeful subject would be the new generation of 
		workers just entering upon their careers. To these youngsters, the idea 
		that service is my business will hold intriguing possibilities. Beneath 
		any protective veneer of cheap cynicism he or she may have accumulated, 
		youth is idealistic. As they enter business life the will to believe is 
		strong, hopes are high. What an opportunity to serve society has the 
		employer of these young hopefuls—an opportunity that can be seized 
		energetically, but too often is woefully ignored.<br>The program 
		planning committee of Rotary International has recommended that the 
		following statement be brought to the attention of all Rotarians who are 
		employers of youth.<br><br>1. That every Rotarian engaged in industry 
		and who is the employer of adolescent young persons and/or engages the 
		services of youth direct from school, should constitute himself the 
		friend and advisor, especially during working hours, of each such person 
		in his employ, whether it be in the workshop, factory, or office.<br>
		<br>2. It is suggested that he should, to this end, interview personally 
		each young person being considered for employment or already employed 
		and explain:<br>(a) The difference between work as a means of earning a 
		living and work as a way of living a life;<br>(b) The importance to 
		himself and to the community of the new phase of life into which the 
		youth has entered;<br>(c) The fact that real and practical education and 
		learning begins and does not end upon leaving school;<br>(d) That the 
		acquiring of further academic and scientific knowledge is an essential 
		addition to vocational activities and skill in order to be a success in 
		life and vocation;<br>(e) That immense satisfaction and happiness are 
		attainable from the effort to improve one's knowledge and education and 
		that such effort, when added to good conduct and character, rarely fails 
		to produce material as well as spiritual well-being;<br>(f) That the 
		Rotarian employer is personally interested in him or her and may be 
		regarded as a real friend and advisor.<br><br>3. That each Rotarian 
		employer of youth should take an active interest in the physical welfare 
		of those employes, encouraging them to join physical-fitness classes, 
		etc.<br><br>4. That each Rotarian employer of youth (especially of 
		school-leavers) should encourage such young persons to take advantage of 
		the facilities available in almost every town and city for continued 
		education in day school or at evening classes.<br><br>5. That the 
		Rotarian should make a special point of seeing that such youth, upon 
		joining his firm or company, are placed under the charge of foremen or 
		directive employees who will and can guide them in the acquisition of 
		good habits and manner of work leading to the development of skill and 
		interest in their work.<br><br>6. That the Rotarian's personal interest 
		in the youth be expressed, if possible, to their parents and the utmost 
		encouragement and co-operation of the latter be sought.<br><br>Many 
		Rotarians are attempting to apply these suggestions methodically in 
		their own enterprises, just as many Rotary clubs are organizing 
		occupational information by their members for youth who are choosing a 
		career. By a recent decision of the board of directors of Rotary 
		International, these club projects are considered as vocational 
		service—if the information includes definite explanations of the concept 
		of service in each occupation.<br><br>The employer who says to himself, 
		&quot;Service is my business&quot; and really believes it, will interest himself 
		in the youth he employs and in more ways than any set of recommendations 
		can outline. He will regard these young people, not as mere means of 
		production, but as ends in themselves, as constituting a part at least 
		of the purpose of his business. His business may be the building of 
		great cranes to lift the burdens of humanity, but just as surely he is 
		also building lives. Future generations will witness how well he has 
		built.<br><br>Are you developing cordial, helpful relations with the 
		younger employees in your business?</td>
