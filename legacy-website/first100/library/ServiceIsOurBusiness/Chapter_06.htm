		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">CONFIDENCE in business is founded 
		on fact and exact statement. Millions upon millions of statements are 
		made every day in all sorts of business situations and by every possible 
		medium of communication. Each occasion is a test of the good faith that 
		relates the individual's integrity to the general prosperity. Of all 
		such occasions, advertising is responsible for the greatest number of 
		statements with the most continuous impact on public confidence. The 
		vast sums spent for advertising—billions of dollars a year in the United 
		States alone—are easily justified by increased volume of sales and 
		consequent employment. More important than costs, however, is the 
		challenge contained in the question that should be applied rigorously by 
		every advertiser to his &quot;copy&quot;: Is it the truth?<br><br>From time to 
		time, a voice is heard crying in the wilderness that there is still 
		adequate selling-power in honest, straightforward advertising. The 
		average man has more common-sense and better taste than the advertiser 
		often credits him with having. People may succumb to the oft-repeated 
		lie, but slanted statements eventually produce in them apathy and 
		disillusionment. There is a resentful feeling that they are being pushed 
		around. They want desperately to know &quot;what is going on.&quot; They are 
		hungry for the truth.<br><br>How such feelings may affect the response 
		to advertising was dramatically illustrated in a story told originally 
		in a trade publication and well-known to advertising men. The 
		advertising manager of a department store in Iowa was ill, and his new 
		assistant was doing his best to keep things going. The proprietor, noted 
		for his bluntness of speech, walked into the office.<br><br>&quot;Young man,&quot; 
		he said, &quot;I want you to stir up some interest in the water-proof garment 
		department. The fact is, we have a lot of raincoats that we've got to 
		get rid of. They are shopworn and some of them are cracked, and we're 
		offering them for little or nothing. Now we've got to get the people to 
		buy them. There are some good ones in the lot, but if we can't sell 
		them, we might as well dump them in the river.&quot;<br><br>The young man 
		assured the &quot;boss&quot; that he knew exactly how to do it. The next morning 
		the storm broke when the merchant opened his paper to read the store's 
		advertisement for the day. There they were —his own words in bold-face 
		type across the page.<br><br>&quot;To tell the truth we have a lot of 
		raincoats we've got to get rid of. They are shopworn and some of them 
		are cracked. We are offering them for little or nothing.”<br><br>Down 
		went his fist on the table, rattling the dishes, and spilling the 
		coffee.<br><br>He read on: &quot;There are some good ones in the lot, but it 
		we can't sell them, we might as well dump them in the river.”<br><br>
		Arriving at the store, still fuming, the merchant headed for the 
		advertising office. His partner met him on the way and asked, &quot;Have you 
		heard about the raincoats?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Have I? I'm on my way to kick that 
		fool out!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then you haven't heard',' remarked his partner. &quot;We 
		couldn't handle the crowd. Every raincoat we advertised was sold thirty 
		minutes after we opened. That advertisement was a wonder. Seemed to 
		please people by its absolute frankness.”<br><br>The chance remark of an 
		attorney in an American courtroom had wide repercussions. It ignited the 
		spark of a great movement. Brushing off a charge of inaccuracy, he was 
		heard to say: &quot;Why of course all advertising is exaggerated. Nobody 
		really believes it.”<br><br>The utter absurdity of this statement 
		impressed a listener in the courtroom. If nobody really believes it, 
		what's the use of advertising? Yet, every exaggeration or distortion of 
		tact does indeed tend to destroy confidence not only in the 
		advertisement but in all advertising and all business. The millions of 
		dollars spent in advertising are wasted if nobody believes it. So began 
		a long and successful campaign for truth in advertising that led 
		eventually to the Better Business Bureau with its organized effort to 
		unmask fraud and deception.<br><br>Truth is the primary purpose of the 
		Better Business Bureau. Truth is its weapon. The local branches of the 
		bureau do not prosecute the swindler or the deceptive advertiser. They 
		merely expose him. Investigation-analysis—publicity—is the sequence 
		which brings truth to light, and forces him to desist or retract 
		publicly. Extensive records are kept by the bureaus for the protection 
		of investors, customers, and newspapers who might be involved. Through 
		these powerful means, Better Business Bureaus in nearly a hundred cities 
		of the United States are .protecting the reputation of legitimate 
		business and helping to sustain the credibility of all advertising. Many 
		Rotary clubs have helped to bring them into existence. Many Rotarians 
		are active as managers or as members of their local boards.<br><br>
		Volumes would be required to catalogue the. tricks—some crude, some 
		subtle—through which advertising deviates from the truth. One common 
		kind of deception was illustrated in the radio program of the American 
		comedians, Amos and Andy. Exultantly, Andy brought home a fraudulent 
		insurance policy, impressive with its gold seal and blue ribbon. It 
		promised a thousand dollars to his heirs. Amos examined the policy 
		carefully, and then remarked sadly: &quot;It's no good, Andy. The big type 
		gives it to you; and the little type takes it away.”<br><br>Business men 
		whose behavior in their personal transactions is above suspicion succumb 
		sometimes to a sort of poetic or artistic license when it comes to 
		approving advertisements. Only a constant zeal for truth can make them 
		alert to discern possible deviations. The following questions may help 
		Rotarians to detect some of the misleading devices that creep into 
		advertisements:<br><br>Is the format of the advertisement used to 
		underplay important, but less attractive aspects, of the business offer?<br>
		Do pictures or descriptive phrases used, give an objective description 
		of the article?<br><br>Are terms like &quot;scientific proof;' &quot;cold facts',' 
		&quot;inside figures&quot; used to bolster loose statements?<br><br>Are 
		testimonials by celebrities in other fields honest evidence of technical 
		superiority?<br><br>Should paid testimonials be used?<br><br>Do 
		comparative statements such as &quot;formerly $10&quot; or &quot;up to $100 values&quot; 
		describe exactly the reduction in prices of individual articles that has 
		occurred?<br><br>Is every person concerned with issuing the 
		advertisement thoroughly aware of his responsibility to the whole 
		public?<br><br>The responsibility of advertising is to inform the 
		customer so that he may purchase more intelligently. This purpose is not 
		accomplished by claims or implications that the advertiser is 
		underselling his competitors. Such aspersions are as unfair in respect 
		of competitor relations as they are generally inaccurate and misleading.<br>
		<br>They cannot always be exposed, however, as readily as was the 
		salesman who boasted that &quot;our paint is used on eighty per cent of the 
		cars in America.&quot;<br><br>Impatiently the buyer interrupted him: &quot;Your 
		rival says in his catalogue that his paint is used on seventy per cent.&quot;<br>
		&quot;What did I tell you?&quot; retorted the salesman. &quot;We've got him beat by ten 
		per cent.&quot;<br><br>Comparisons are stupid as well as odious if they 
		distract attention from the merits of the product advertised. Yet, how 
		often this happens. Two well-known department stores condescended to 
		berate each other recently over the merits of a new style of fountain 
		pen. One store advertised that it had been the &quot;first in the world&quot; with 
		the great invention. The other swung back: &quot;Do you own a horse and buggy 
		model?&quot; Next week, the reply came: &quot;When Johnny-come-lately tries to put 
		Johnny-on-the-spot on the spot, what happens?&quot; All very clever and 
		amusing, but hardly encouraging to the customer, whose confidence in the 
		product ebbed with the rising tide of competing recriminations.<br><br>
		Of course, there is no way of drawing up a balance-sheet to show the 
		losses to advertisers as a whole that result from misleading 
		advertisements. The incident of the shopworn raincoats was a 
		parable—even though it actually occurred. The misleading advertiser may 
		trade for a while on the confidence created by others, but his 
		reputation is likely to suffer more than theirs, so that in the end it 
		will not pay him to advertise at all. Indeed, there is evidence that in 
		actual practice crooked business shuns publicity of any kind.<br><br>But 
		advertising after all is only one phase of business -an echo which 
		translates into public expression the pitch of integrity attained in 
		plant and office and other departments. The echo rebounds from one 
		department to another. A concern which tries to tool others is likely to 
		end by tooling itself. If the advertisement is untrustworthy, what can 
		be expected of the salesman's expense account or the stockroom 
		inventory? If the pitch is false throughout, it can mean ruin.<br><br>
		Many business men have realized the critical importance of integrity 
		throughout their organizations by making this question, &quot;Is it the 
		truth?&quot; - a test for every decision and transaction in their business. 
		They have instructed every employee to use it habitually. They have not 
		allowed the shitting sands of fashion nor the clamor of competition to 
		divert them from the need for plain facts and exact statements in every 
		business relationship. They know that it pays to be truthful. Nor are 
		they disturbed in this conviction by the play of subtle minds. &quot;&quot;What is 
		truth?&quot; said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer. The 
		answer is clear enough, for it is not honest error, but deliberate 
		misstatement and misrepresentation, that destroy confidence.<br><br>It 
		is told of Socrates that one day when he was bathing, a young man came 
		to him and said, &quot;Master, I have traveled a long distance to see you. 
		Will you teach me what is Truth?&quot;<br><br>Socrates invited him into the 
		water; then put his head under and held it there until the young man 
		struggled and gasped for breath. When he indignantly demanded to know 
		the reason for such treatment, Socrates replied: &quot;When you want Truth as 
		much as you wanted air just now, you will find it.&quot;<br><br>A passion for 
		truth in every detail and every aspect of the daily round in business or 
		profession can only be cultivated slowly and methodically. Yet how much 
		the business or profession will benefit from it! Once the subterfuges 
		and misrepresentations are swept ruthlessly away, good faith and 
		confidence will lay open the path to greater service.<br><br>How could 
		your club help to improve the standards of advertising in its trading 
		area?</td>
