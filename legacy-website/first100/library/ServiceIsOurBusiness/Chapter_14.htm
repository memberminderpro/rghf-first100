		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">It's Your Move Now<br><br>How 
		often the player at chess or checkers, as the game reaches its final 
		stages receives the brusque reminder: &quot;It's your move now!&quot; That player 
		might well be compared with the reader of this book. Here, too, many 
		pieces have been moved about the board. Vocational service has been 
		&quot;played&quot; in terms of craftsmanship, good faith, human engineering — in 
		their many aspects. As in chess or checkers, some of the pieces may have 
		been lost. The reader, like the player, has not retained them for his 
		use. Yet some remain, and he is confronted with the question, what shall 
		he do with them. &quot;It's your move now!&quot; Similarly, a Rotarian impressed 
		by the horizons of opportunity to serve society is not unlike the player 
		who speculates about some brilliant strategy for winning the game. He, 
		too, is challenged to do something about it. The large contributions 
		that vocational service can make to the world will not be accomplished 
		through discussion, still less by solemn resolutions in Rotary clubs. 
		The genius of Rotary is individual action. The product of Rotary is men. 
		Particularly is this the case in vocational service. When a Rotarian, 
		convinced of the challenge to leadership in business or profession asks 
		impatiently, &quot;Why doesn't someone do something about it?&quot; he is promptly 
		invited to—&quot;look in the mirror, and meet someone who can and should.&quot;<br>
		<br>What process is it that goes on inside a man when the discussion of 
		ideal goals is translated into practical activity? Some light on this 
		abstruse problem may be found in an episode that occurred in a steamship 
		office where several applicants for the post of radio operator had 
		gathered to be interviewed. Their excited discussion of the prospects 
		for employment made them ob­livious to the dots and dashes that began 
		coming over the loud speaker.<br><br>About that time, another man 
		entered the office and sat down quietly by himself. Suddenly he snapped 
		to attention, walked into the private office, and in a few minutes came 
		out smiling.<br><br>&quot;Say,&quot; called out one of the group, &quot;how did you get 
		in ahead of us? We were here first.&quot;<br><br>&quot;One of you would have got 
		the job,&quot; the man replied, &quot;if you had listened to the message from the 
		loud speaker.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What message?&quot; they asked in surprise.<br><br>
		&quot;Why, the code;' he told them. &quot;It said, 'The man I need must always be 
		on the alert. The man who gets this message and comes directly into my 
		private office will be placed in one of my ships as a radio operator! &quot;<br>
		<br>How many Rotarians have listened to talks on vocational service at 
		conventions, district meetings, or in their own clubs? How many have 
		been alert to recog­nize the message that would send them back to their 
		offices with a plan of action? There is no way of telling, and if it 
		could be told, the record might not be very encouraging. The transition 
		from thought to action is often devious and fraught with peril for the 
		idea. So much depends on the disposition of the man himself, his methods 
		and habits in dealing with ideas.<br><br>Accordingly, the Rotarian who 
		has given some thought to vocational service may also recognize the need 
		to service himself vocationally.<br><br>The specific application of 
		vocational service to a particular business or professional practice may 
		not be apparent immediately. On the surface, established routines may 
		seem well enough, or the prospect of injecting an entirely fresh note 
		into the complex inter-relationships of an active organization may 
		appear bewildering. The Rotarian who asks himself, &quot;Where shall I 
		start?&quot; may find himself answering rather in the vein of the farmer who 
		encountered a stranger hopelessly lost in the country.<br><br>&quot;Which 
		road do I take for Cincinnati?&quot; inquired the traveler.<br><br>The farmer 
		deliberated for awhile, and then in a burst of confidence, &quot;You know, if 
		I were going to Cincinnati, I wouldn't start from here!'<br><br>Yet, 
		right here in the Rotarian's own office, store, or factory is the 
		opportunity to serve society. Where should he begin? What particular 
		phase of his many relationships most urgently requires attention?<br>
		<br>One way to find out is in the series of questions called, &quot;A 
		Vocational Service Score Card,&quot; a personal check-up sheet that is 
		available from Rotary International. So phrased that they call for 
		definite answers, these questions will demonstrate to anyone just where 
		his vocational service has been lacking, if he will consider them in all 
		honesty and sincerity. One prominent Rotarian who had checked himself 
		with the score card confessed that after he had totaled his score he 
		tore the paper into tiny pieces and threw them into the waste-basket 
		hoping that the charwoman was not an addict of the &quot;jig-saw&quot; puzzle.<br>
		<br>Most Rotarians who use the score card will find the need for 
		improvement in some one phase of their vocational service emphasized in 
		their answers. There is the place to begin!<br><br>The process of 
		servicing himself vocationally cannot stop here, however. Business and 
		professional practice goes on continuously from day to day, bringing new 
		problems into focus, calling for practical decisions of greater or less 
		importance. To realize, even with a shock, the need for improvement is 
		not enough. An habitual attitude, proof alike against monotony and 
		against surprise, must be developed.<br><br>Many Rotarians habitually 
		set apart a few minutes at the beginning of each day as a quiet time for 
		previewing the day's work as an opportunity for service. They ask 
		themselves: &quot;What is being done in my busi­ness that ought not to be 
		done?&quot; &quot;What things ought we to be doing that we are not doing?&quot; They 
		anticipate the decisions that they or their associates may be called 
		upon to make, and try to judge them objectively in the light of social 
		usefulness.<br><br>A simple standard of judgment that can be applied 
		spontaneously to every contingency as it arises, is &quot;The Four-Way Test 
		of the things we think, we say or do.&quot;*<br><br>1. Is it the TRUTH?<br>
		<br>2. It is FAIR to all concerned?<br><br>3. Will it build GOODWILL and 
		BETTER FRIEND­SHIPS?<br><br>4. Will it be BENEFICIAL to all concerned?<br>
		<br>The Rotarian who originated The Four-Way Test took over a large 
		business that was on the rocks. An official of the bank which had given 
		this company a large loan in its prosperous days, and expected to lose 
		it, declared that he had never heard of a concern &quot;so broke&quot; coming 
		back. Yet, by putting the &quot;Test&quot; in con­trol of its policies, the 
		business was piloted to solvency. Immediate sacrifice of profits that 
		failed to square with these requirements was amply repaid by a more 
		efficient organization, employee dependability, and the confidence of 
		customers.<br><br>Let no one suppose that translating vocational service 
		principles into practice can be achieved overnight. Said the originator 
		of The Four-Way Test: &quot;Though we ask our stockholders, employees, 
		distributors, and customers to let us know when we don't live up to the 
		Test, after many years of sincere endeavor we feel that we are living up 
		to about seventy per cent of our ideals. We regret that we haven't done 
		better. Yet I can see that we are making progress in learning what The 
		Four-Way Test really means!'<br><br>Servicing himself vocationally 
		extends beyond the &quot;quiet time&quot; when the Rotarian considers his business 
		or professional problems in the light of social usefulness. &quot;Sharing&quot; is 
		no less essential, not only as insurance that the new directions will be 
		carried out intelligently by associates, but also as a check on the 
		resolution and sincerity of the Rotarian himself. Talking them over with 
		others subjects intentions that have been conceived in a moment of 
		enthusiasm to some sort of check and challenge. The Rotarian who takes a 
		framed copy of The Four-Way Test and hangs it in his office for all to 
		see issues a tacit invitation to every customer and client to measure 
		performance with professions. Employees are given to understand what 
		they can expect from their employer as well as what he expects of them. 
		Even competitors are summoned to help in keeping the business &quot;on the 
		beam!' Can anyone with experience in business or profession fail to see 
		that such courageous sharing is sound from every standpoint? As one 
		Rotarian remarked: &quot;Here are all the tools to do a good and practical 
		job in human relations!'<br><br>Will you give these tools a fair trial, 
		a thoughtful and thorough application to the problems and opportunities 
		of your working day? To impart a new tone to your business or 
		professional relationships may call for some courage and persistence. As 
		a Rotary bulletin put it: &quot;We must have the freedom to fail. Ford forgot 
		to put a reverse gear in his first automobile. Edison once spent two 
		million dollars on an invention that proved of little value. The 
		galleries are full of critics. They play no ball. They fight no fights. 
		They make no mistakes because they attempt nothing. Down in the arena 
		are the doers. They make some mistakes because they attempt many 
		things.&quot;<br><br>This is the mood of high adventure in which a Rotarian 
		who has really caught the spirit of Rotary will regard his vocation. 
		Many things are to be attempted in sharing with others his realization 
		that &quot;service is my business.&quot; The chance of occasional failures will 
		not deter him for he knows that true success in his business or 
		profession lies in making the attempt. For this cause came he into the 
		world.<br><br>It's your move now! Whether a Rotarian score himself, has 
		a daily &quot;quiet time&quot; or shares with his business associates his 
		resolution to serve society; whatever means he may use for translating 
		the ideas of vocational service into action and habit are strictly his 
		own business. Somehow that transition must be made, however, if Rotary 
		is to escape the charge that vocational service is theoretical, 
		mystical, and intangible. Words, glittering generalities, persuasive 
		examples, eloquent speeches will avail nothing unless Rotarians apply 
		them. Vocational service will exist only as a spectre at the feast if it 
		is not put to practical use.<br><br>The Spanish philosopher, Unamuno, 
		tells of the aqueduct in Segovia. Built by the Romans 1,800 years ago, 
		it carried cool waters from the mountains to the thirsty city. Nearly 
		sixty generations of men drank from it. Then came another generation 
		which said: &quot;This aqueduct is so great a marvel, it should be preserved 
		for our children's children. We will relieve it of its centuries-old 
		labors!'<br><br>To give it well-earned rest, they introduced a modern 
		water supply. Then it began to fall apart. Built as it had been from 
		rough-hewn granite blocks without lime or cement, the sediment of 
		centuries had formed a natural mortar. Now the dry sun made it crumble. 
		What centuries could not destroy, idleness disintegrated.<br><br>And so 
		it is with vocational service in Rotary. Respected, but unused and set 
		apart from the active business life of Rotarians, it becomes misty and 
		impractical. It tends to fall apart. Tried and tested in daily combat 
		with the tough problems of business or professional practice, vocational 
		service grows with fresh vitality and meaning. Like the ripples from a 
		stone flung into a pool, the influence of Rotary can stir the stagnant 
		waters of commerce. The lines run out in countless directions when the 
		individual Rotarian uses voca­tional service in his business or 
		profession. Today it can begin. It's your move now!</td>
