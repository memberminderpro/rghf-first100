		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">THE contract, express or implied, 
		which ties a man to his job is one in which good faith must have the 
		deepest significance. From the employer's stand-point, the work done 
		within his business is the commodity he offers to society. Faithful work 
		is essential to the success of the business—faithful employees its 
		greatest asset.<br><br>For the employee, this contract concerns the most 
		precious of all commodities—his own life—which he invests in the 
		organization that employs him. His past experience, present status, and 
		future hopes arc all packaged in this fateful agreement. If he does not 
		have confidence that he is &quot;getting a square deal&quot; in return for his 
		outlay of energy and skill, he suffers a deep frustration that may be 
		harmful to his efficiency.<br><br>The question of a person's worth is 
		not determined, of course, by the whim or benevolence of the employer. A 
		cartoon pictures a bar of iron worth $5.oo. The same bar of iron made 
		into horseshoes would be worth $10.50. Made into needles, it has a value 
		of $3,285.01; and if turned into balance-springs for watches, it becomes 
		worth $250,000.00. The value of any material is not determined so much 
		by what is in it as by the service it performs.<br><br>So it is with 
		people. Their economic value depends on what they produce. This, in 
		turn, depends upon great many complicated considerations. Only under the 
		most primitive conditions of production and barter might the worker hope 
		to get the full value of his production. In the Middle Ages, the problem 
		was already so complex that theologians argued endlessly over the just 
		wage and the just price. Today, with machine production and the extreme 
		specialization that separate the producer from the ultimate consumer, 
		the problem of what is a just wage in any particular instance becomes 
		practically insoluble.<br><br>The president of a Brazilian Rotary club, 
		in an address on employee relations, expressed part of the dilemma as 
		follows:<br><br>The principle is that it does not appear to be right to 
		fix the same remuneration for good and bad elements alike, and to lose 
		sight of the immediate aim of a salary which should correspond to the 
		work produced. We admit that the minimum wage was a necessity to avoid 
		abuses. But from there onward, the actual system of increasing wages 
		under threats, or under impositions, including prosperous concerns with 
		those of smaller resources, comes to be a crying inequality.<br><br>The 
		difficulty of actually achieving a square deal with employees only 
		increases the need for good faith in seeking one. An open and earnest 
		effort to establish a fair scale of rewards is needed. But, in 
		describing the efforts of some Rotarians, no claim is made that any one 
		of them actually achieves a square deal or that a specific plan could be 
		used in every business. They are reported, rather, as manifestations of 
		good faith and sincere intention.<br><br>Each business has its own 
		special problems and must cut its coat according to its cloth.<br><br>
		The modern sciences of aptitude-testing and job-analysis are useful in 
		finding the relative worth of employees in the same business. Keeping 
		square pegs out of round holes, and making sure that each task is valued 
		correctly in terms of difficulty and experience does not determine, 
		however, what wages should be paid. At best, human abilities are 
		conserved with resulting benefit to all concerned.<br><br>A Swiss 
		Rotarian was able to develop a simple plan for determining wages in a 
		plant where there had been many complaints and jealousies among the 
		workers. A basic wage was graduated according to the age and domestic 
		responsibilities of the worker. To this was added a so-called active 
		wage based on the degree of skill or experience required by the 
		particular job. In addition, a productive wage was geared to output. 
		Since each part of the plan was assessed on a common point system, the 
		satisfaction of the workers arose from knowing exactly what was required 
		to improve their position.<br><br>A rather similar point system is used 
		by an American insurance company to decide the readiness of its 
		employees for promotion. The following qualities are taken into 
		consideration: teachability, supervisory responsibility, initiative, 
		public relations, analytical ability, personal friendliness, monetary 
		responsibility, application, volume of work, neatness and accuracy, 
		thoroughness.<br><br>Each quality (teachability, for example) is 
		assessed according to the following definitions, and the capacity for 
		advancement emerges from the average score after all the qualities have 
		been assessed.<br><br>Needs repeated instruction (unsatisfactory in 
		present position)..... 1<br>Requires detailed instruction (decreasing 
		efficiency)..... 2<br>Slightly below average (keep in present 
		position)..... 3<br>Average (advance questionable)..... 4<br>Slightly 
		above average (advance slowly)..... 5<br>Readily grasps new ideas 
		(advance steadily)..... 6<br>Outstanding ability (advance rapidly)..... 
		7<br><br>An obvious weakness of this system is the variability of human 
		capacities and the relative importance of particular qualities to any 
		given job. The chief advantage, however, is in making such assessments 
		known to the employee. In this way he may see where improvement is 
		needed and be convinced of the good faith of his employer and that he is 
		receiving a square deal. Many Rotarians take pride in the fact that 
		their good faith with employees is so evident, and working conditions so 
		satisfactory, that: no employee has ever been moved to ask for a raise.<br>
		<br>It would be ideal if ambition could be directed always into 
		constructive effort through the assurance that increased productivity 
		would reflect automatically in the pay check. The National Industrial 
		Conference Board (U.S.A.) offered a critical study of “measured day 
		work.” A base rate of pay was established after a job had been valued in 
		terms of complexity, skill, mental, and physical demands. This rate was 
		then compared with prevailing rates for similar jobs in the same area. 
		In addition, extra compensation ranging from 15 percent to 25 percent of 
		the measured day rate was given for production, quality, versatility, 
		and dependability. One result of this plan has been less spoilage, 
		because the worker knows that each piece of scrap affects his rating. 
		There is also an eagerness to develop short cuts in manufacturing, and 
		closer relations with supervisors.<br><br>One disadvantage noted was 
		that exceptionally fast workers are discouraged by the limited variation 
		between normal and maximum rates. That weakness was overcome by a 
		Rotarian who operates a factory with fifty employees. He made them 
		virtual sub-contractors of the orders which came into the plant. The 
		employer furnished the material and machines, and bore the overhead 
		expense. The worker supplied his labor at a rate considered fair to him, 
		to the company, and to the customer, From the moment this sub-contract 
		was accepted, the worker became his own boss. The faster he worked, the 
		more orders he could handle and the higher his wages would climb.<br>
		<br>This scheme was profitable to the company because it permitted exact 
		cost control, and the results in employee satisfaction were amazing. Not 
		only did ambition lead to greatly increased earnings, but there was no 
		need for pushing or for stop-watch holding and little need for 
		inspection because a spoiled unit had to be done over on the employee's 
		own time.<br><br>There is ample evidence that thorough development of 
		such plans is beneficial to all concerned. Another company with an 
		incentive-pay plan reported an 80 per cent decrease in man-hours for the 
		same volume of goods, a $5,000 annual wage for laboring men, lower 
		prices to the customer, and dividends on a stable basis from year to 
		year for the stockholders.<br><br>Business stability interests not only 
		stockholders but everyone affected by the boom-and-bust cycle that has 
		plagued world economy. Most affected of all is the employee who is laid 
		off during slack times. One man so affected strode into the office of 
		his Rotarian employer.<br><br>&quot;You can't do this to me!&quot; he declared 
		bluntly. &quot;You can't turn me out onto the street. You wouldn't do that to 
		a horse. You can't do it to me&quot;<br><br>The employer was embarrassed. 
		&quot;Can't you go back to the job you came from?&quot; he asked.<br><br>“No, I 
		can't” said the man. &quot;I had just got a little business started when you 
		sent a man to ask me to work for you. I didn't know that you would just 
		keep me a couple of months—just long enough to ruin my business—and then 
		turn me out&quot;<br><br>This caused the Rotarian to think hard. His business 
		was of a seasonal nature, and such layoffs were quite common and 
		customary. But were they fair to all concerned? By careful planning, he 
		was able to reorganize his operations so that every employee -was hired 
		at an annual wage. The key to his plan -was flexibility. New employees 
		were assigned to an &quot;extra gang&quot; which fills in wherever there is a 
		rush. Whole departments were organized as extra gangs. In this way, it 
		was possible to keep his labor force busy and earning most of the year.<br>
		<br>That this plan, coupled with an incentive system on a departmental 
		basis and profit-sharing, is satisfactory to labor is evidenced by the 
		recent renewal of a union contract which included a guaranteed annual 
		wage for 2,080 hours each year. Actually this type of contract is being 
		sought increasingly by trade-unions, and a U.S.A. government study 
		indicates that introducing these features in most seasonal industries 
		would not increase costs more than six per cent if coordinated with 
		existing system of state unemployment compensation. While no panacea for 
		insecurity, this study concluded, the annual wage does make a 
		substantial contribution to the stabilization of purchasing power.<br>
		<br>How purchasing power can be &quot;stabilized&quot; was described at a 
		Christmas party in an American pottery plant where the owner, who had 
		been on poor relief 14 years previously, distributed $705,000 to his 827 
		employees. Each of the 88 men and women who had been with the business 
		ten years or more received a bonus of $3,500. This story-book rise to 
		riches began when the employer with seven other relief clients came to 
		live in an abandoned pottery building. &quot;My road has not been an easy 
		one',' remarked the employer to his party guests, &quot;but no man could ask 
		for one more pleasant. Many people would like to be a king, possess 
		great riches, or live a life of ease, but I would not trade your 
		friendship tor anything in the world.&quot;<br><br>This story has a 
		heart-warming sequel. More than a year later, a disastrous fire left 
		half the pottery a charred and twisted ruin. Uninsured, the owner 
		thought that he was ruined, but he had not counted on his friends. While 
		the building still smoldered, hundreds of employees and townsfolk were 
		at work feverishly clearing away the debris. Manufacturers of materials 
		were promising quick delivery- To show that he could count on them, 
		employees put $1,000 into a pot before the fire was out, and 
		subsequently worked at a low hourly rate on the unfamiliar task of 
		rebuilding. Within two months, the plant was restored and equipped for a 
		greater volume of production. Once more the employer had an apt comment: 
		&quot;I've invested in human nature in this community and no man ever 
		received greater profits than it goodwill.&quot;<br><br>The theme of &quot;you 
		can't take it with you&quot; has often been a dominant note in 
		profit-sharing, but the aim of giving employees a square deal and 
		actually increasing profits through stimulating their keenness, inspires 
		the more carefully thought-out plans. Whether as largess, as a 
		demonstration of good faith, or as plain good business, the tangible 
		participation of employees in the<br>success of capitalist enterprise is 
		receiving widespread attention.<br><br>The Eastern Rotary Wheel reports 
		a club meeting in Calcutta, India, where profit-sharing was seen as the 
		cure for labor conflict, particularly in small concern where there is 
		intimate contact between all sections. Under the New Zealand Company Act 
		(1924 and 1933) a plan for &quot;labor shares&quot; designed by a Rotarian became 
		legal. In this scheme of employee-partnership, control of the business 
		as well as profits is assigned on the basis of personal service. 
		Mountains of statistics were accumulated by a subcommittee of the U.S.A. 
		Senate in its &quot;Survey of Profit-Sharing&quot; (1938) to demonstrate that 
		profit-sharing had been practiced successfully by large impersonal 
		corporations as well as by small firms.<br><br>The objections of labor 
		to profit-sharing, on the grounds that it is an uncertain form of reward 
		and hampers organization, can be overcome. This was demonstrated in the 
		experiment of a Birmingham (England) Rotarian who had had a long 
		experience in sharing his profits. Some skeptics told him: &quot;Yes, men 
		will behave all right while it pays them. If circumstances were such 
		that by showing goodwill it would affect their pockets, there would be a 
		different tale to tell&quot; Also, he heard some trade-unionists say that a 
		firm that has profits to share should pay them out directly in higher 
		wages.<br><br>The Rotarian was so impressed by this last argument that 
		he decided to present such a scheme to his employees—an end to 
		profit-sharing and a general raise in wages. To his surprise, the 
		general meeting of employees received the plan without enthusiasm. 
		Everyone agreed that it was quite generous, but each man who spoke 
		seemed to have the fear that it would spoil the good spirit that had 
		existed hitherto. One remarked that they had ceased to think of their 
		jobs merely in terms of what they were going to get out of them, and did 
		not want to be deprived of their dignity as partners.<br><br>A business 
		that distributes half of its net profits to employees and is now five 
		times as profitable as in the old days when the owner kept all the 
		profits for himself, found that it could accomplish this happy result 
		only with the co-operation of the union. Membership in the union was 
		made a prerequisite of sharing. Dividends were paid monthly according to 
		the changing ratio of the sales value of production to labor costs, With 
		the co-operation of the union in allowing workers to change jobs and to 
		help each other, unit efficiency increased 54 per cent in the first 
		year.<br><br>But what of the non-profit organization? Where there is no 
		opportunity for profit-sharing, or similar employee incentives, can 
		other means be found to provide the square deal for employees?<br><br>
		Rotarians need only to look to their central office in Evanston and to 
		its branch offices to find the answer to this question. Rotary 
		International is strictly a non-profit organization. Its revenue is from 
		a fixed per-capita contribution of its member clubs. Its income 
		increases only in proportion to the increase in the size of the 
		organization—and such increase brings with it a corresponding increase 
		in expenses. Here is found a staff, averaging some 200 persons, who can 
		have no delusion that increased production will result automatically in 
		increased revenue, which will, in turn, be reflected in<br>the pay 
		envelope. They are not dealing with production units and follow no sales 
		graphs or charts. They deal in intangibles. Their interest is in quality 
		production rather than quantity.<br><br>Yet those Rotarians, who have 
		worked closely with these men and women as members of the board of 
		directors or of Rotary International committees, have never failed to 
		marvel at the loyalty, the sincerity, and the esprit de corps of the 
		staff.<br><br>Add to this the fact that the governing body of Rotary 
		International undergoes an almost complete change of personnel annually 
		and a complete change every two years and one wonders, therefore, what 
		may be the secret of this spirit of co-operation between employer and 
		employee. Frankly, there is no secret. It is merely an example of 
		vocational service in action. Rotary International practices what it 
		preaches. Rotary International provides for its employees pleasant 
		working conditions and a healthful, friendly atmosphere in which to 
		work.<br><br>Surely, the principles of vocational service are getting 
		more than lip-service at the headquarters of Rotary International—and in 
		the branches of that office. Rotarians are cordially invited to inspect 
		these &quot;plants&quot; at the first opportunity.<br><br>In all these efforts 
		that Rotarians and others are making to achieve a square deal with 
		employees, the keynote is expansion, increased efficiency, and employee 
		satisfaction. In the square deal, the employee plays his part, convinced 
		and inspired by the good faith manifested by the employer. He begins to 
		identify his interest with the firm and to share the vision of its 
		possibilities. He comes to appreciate the role of capital in storing up 
		profits for a rainy day and investing in new machinery to improve the 
		productivity of labor.<br><br>When the first census of manufacturers in 
		the U.S.A was taken 105 years ago, the average worker was putting in 69 
		hours a week and took home $4.74. The manufacturer had on the average 
		$557 invested for each worker he employed. Today the employer has about 
		$10,000 invested for each worker who puts in about half as many hours 
		and draws nearly twenty times as man dollars. The importance of this 
		form of profit-sharing will not be lost on the employee who appreciates<br>
		square deal, and he will seek to reciprocate by refraining from wildcat 
		strikes, by meeting production standards, and by striving to attain the 
		qualities of the faithful employee specified in the following statement:<br>
		<br>A SEARCH FOR MEN<br><br>Wanted<br><br>A man for hard work and rapid 
		promotion, a man who can find things to do without the help of a manager 
		and three assistants.<br><br>A man who gets to work on time in the 
		morning and does not imperil the lives of others in an effort to be the 
		first out at night,<br><br>A man who is neat in appearance.<br><br>A man 
		who does not sulk for an hour's overtime in emergencies,<br><br>A man 
		who listens carefully when he is spoken to and asks only enough 
		questions to insure the accurate carrying out of instructions.<br><br>A 
		man who looks you straight in the eye and tells you the truth every 
		lime.<br><br>A man who does not pity himself for having to work.<br><br>
		APPLY ANYWHERE: The world is searching for such men.<br><br>Perhaps 
		Winston Churchill was thinking of such men when he described his view of 
		the square deal enlarged lo a national scale:<br><br>&quot;Our aim is to 
		build a property-owning democracy, both independent and interdependent. 
		In this I include profit-sharing schemes in suitable industries and 
		intimate consultation between employers and wage-earners. We seek as far 
		as possible to make the status of the wage-earner that of a partner 
		rather than an irresponsible employee.<br><br>&quot;It is in the interest of 
		the wage-earner to have many other alternatives open to him than service 
		under one all-powerful employer called the State. We do not wish the 
		people of this ancient island reduced to a mass of State-directed 
		proletarians, thrown hither and thither, housed here and there, by an 
		aristocracy of privileged officials or trade-union bosses. Our ideal is 
		a consenting union of free, independent families, and homes.&quot;<br><br>
		Perhaps the first step in realizing this ideal is for employers to 
		subject their present arrangements in rewarding and advancing their 
		employees to a careful scrutiny. They might ask themselves questions 
		such as those suggested by a British Rotarian in writing on 
		&quot;Incentives&quot;:<br><br>(1) Are the people in production sure of receiving 
		justice from all grades of management?<br>(2) Have they a sense of 
		security?<br>(3) Is effort made to keep them fit?<br>(4) Do the wages 
		they receive insure the security of decent living?<br>(5) Are they 
		convinced that they will be promoted if they have the ability?<br>(6) Is 
		the paramount incentive, creative activity aroused?<br>(7) Do they feel 
		the sense of dignity of man in the work they perform?<br>(8) Are they 
		made to feel the sense of duty, to get the spirit of their 
		responsibility and their duty to the community?<br>(9) Do they realize 
		that the dignity of man means the application of inescapable duties?<br>
		<br>Even though it may not be practical to redeal the cards immediately, 
		it should be possible to remove the suspicion that whim or accident is a 
		controlling factor. To establish confidence in his own good intentions 
		is essential for any employer who hopes to inspire goodwill and earnest 
		effort.<br><br>How do you plan to achieve a square deal with your 
		employees?</td>
