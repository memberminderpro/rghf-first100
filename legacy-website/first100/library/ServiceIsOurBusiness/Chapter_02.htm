		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">Paul Harris, the founder of 
		Rotary, was a lawyer. Jealous for the honor of his profession, he took 
		an active part in the work of legal associations—local, state, national, 
		and international. In those days of 1905, there was the gulf of a long 
		tradition between members of the learned professions and those engaged 
		in trade. Paul Harris felt deeply a need to bridge that gulf—to rescue 
		the professional man from an isolation that was alternately lonesome and 
		irritating—to dignify the occupation of tradesman with a zeal for its 
		honor.<br><br>So to the first meeting in Chicago of the first Rotary 
		club he invited a coal dealer, a tailor, and a mining engineer.<br><br>
		Men of different vocations, trades, and professions formed the first 
		Rotary club. Vocation was the principle of selection at the beginning, 
		and has remained the distinguishing core of Rotary ever since.<br><br>
		Let it not be thought, however, that the implications of this principle 
		have remained unchanged through years. The impact of practical 
		experience on earnest men such as Arthur Frederick Sheldon stimulated a 
		continuing development. An early member of the Rotary club, Sheldon 
		established a school of salesmanship based on the idea that successful 
		salesmanship depends on rendering service and that no transaction is 
		justified unless both parties benefit. He gave to Rotary slogan, &quot;he 
		profits most who serves best.&quot;<br><br>Hardly had this concept been 
		presented than objections were heard that it made greed the motive of 
		service. An alternative proposed by B. F. Collins, President of the 
		Rotary Club of Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S.A., was &quot;service above self&quot; 
		which came into use on Rotary stationery in conjunction with the Sheldon 
		slogan. This compromise received official sanction from the Rotary 
		International convention in 1950 although complaints about each of the 
		mottoes still occur occasionally. Those who believe that profits are the 
		basis of free enterprise contend that &quot;service above self&quot; is 
		unrealistic if not subversive, while others<br>reply that selfless 
		dedication is the secret of success of any business or profession. Such 
		vigorous controversy cannot help but move forward the thinking of 
		Rotarians in vocational service, for where all think alike, there is not 
		much thinking done, and little progress can be expected.<br><br>Nowhere 
		is there more substantial testimony to the evolving character of 
		vocational service than in the official phrasings of this avenue of 
		Rotary. It appeared first in the constitution of the Rotary Club of 
		Chicago (January, 1906). The first of the two objects reads as follows:<br>
		The promotion of the business interests of its members.<br><br>Before 
		this aim is condemned as utterly selfish, the comment of a past 
		president of Rotary International may be recalled: &quot;Vocational service 
		really started in the early clubs when they had an official known as a 
		statistician whose duty it was to compile each week all the orders that 
		had been given or received by members. But that kind of vocational 
		service, we found, would not work. I am not ashamed of it, however, 
		because they were helping each other even then.&quot;<br><br>In 1912, this 
		statement of vocational service was abandoned, and the International 
		Association of Rotary Clubs adopted for the guidance of clubs and the 
		individual Rotarian as the first of five objects:<br><br>1. To promote 
		the recognition of the worthiness of all legitimate occupations, and to 
		dignify each member's occupation as affording him an opportunity to 
		serve society; to encourage high standards in business and professions; 
		to increase the efficiency of each member by the exchange of ideas and 
		business methods.<br><br>&quot;The ideal of service as the basis of all 
		worthy enterprise&quot; was introduced in 1918 together with a rearrangement 
		in order of the objects. In 1922, the paragraph which called for an 
		exchange of ideas and business methods was dropped, and the word 
		&quot;useful&quot; replaced &quot;legitimate&quot; in the first paragraph of the object as 
		last quoted.<br><br>No further change was made until 1935, when the Six 
		Objects were restated as Four Objects, and vocational service was 
		presented in the phrasing that was retained n 1951 when it became the 
		second of four avenues in the single Object of Rotary:<br><br>2. High 
		ethical standards in business and professions; the recognition of the 
		worthiness of all useful occupations; and the dignifying by each 
		Rotarian of his occupation as an opportunity to serve society.<br><br>So 
		the dominant impulse of vocational service, present at the start, 
		developed and expanded. Helpfulness to others—not only to fellow 
		Rotarians but to all the &quot;others&quot; who make up human society. Respect for 
		others—not only the rather ambiguous &quot;legitimate occupations&quot; but all 
		&quot;useful&quot; ones. Thoughtfulness of others—not only in the cause of 
		increased efficiency—-though that is important—but in every way that 
		will extend the usefulness and consequent dignity of his occupation.<br>
		<br>The dignity of a profession derives from the reputation of its 
		practitioners for dedicating their learning and skill to the service of 
		others rather than to personal profit. &quot;In fixing fees,&quot; declares the 
		American Bar Association, &quot;it should not be forgotten that the 
		profession of law is a branch of the administration of justice and not a 
		mere money-getting trade.&quot; Doctors of medicine subscribe to the 
		statement that &quot;a profession has for its prime object the service it can 
		render humanity; reward of financial gain should be a subordinate 
		consideration.” In so far as a business man earnestly applies to his 
		working life the dignifying concept of &quot;service above self,&quot; he too can 
		aspire to professional status.<br><br>&quot;I thank God that I am in the 
		paper business,&quot; a manufacturer told a Rotarian clergyman. &quot;I believe 
		that it is a service calling just as much as your ministry. Every time I 
		see children carrying home bread and meat from the store wrapped in 
		clean paper, I give thanks that I am permitted to serve them in this 
		manner.&quot;<br><br>On the other hand, it should be apparent that the human 
		relations that concern vocational service are just as challenging to the 
		professional man. He, too, is obligated as a trustee of his 
		classification, to exemplify and share the ideal of service with his 
		patients, clients, or pupils, with suppliers of his practical needs, and 
		with colleagues or competitors. Even if he has few or no employees 
		himself, he is still in a position to help people become better and 
		happier employees. In association with Rotarians who are businessmen, he 
		may be reminded how the dignity of his occupation derives from service.<br>
		<br>&quot;It has been said that in this town,&quot; reported a Rotary club in the 
		Eastern Hemisphere, &quot;certain members of the medical profession have not 
		been living up to their Hippocratic Oath, and that in the course of 
		healing they also clean out their patients' pockets. Washing of dirty 
		linen among Rotary members may well have a salutary effect. It is 
		proposed to arrange a symposium of a doctor, patient, and onlooker to 
		discuss the comprehensive picture, the difficulties, problems, and 
		prospects.&quot;<br><br>These critics were trying to defend the dignity of an 
		occupation by providing an opportunity for practitioners to explain its 
		contributions to the common welfare. Without such opportunities for 
		defense, the rascality of a tiny minority of doctors with money-mania is 
		used to justify general charges of clandestine fee-splitting, 
		prescription of unnecessary treatments or surgery and the abuse of 
		insurance plans. Miracle drugs and vaccines are given the credit for 
		keeping people well while the old-fashioned doctor—sitting beside the 
		bedside waiting for nature to take its course—is mourned. Opportunity to 
		examine such charges before his Rotary club will be welcomed by any 
		physician just as the representatives of education, law, and religion 
		rejoice in defending the honor of their occupations against similar 
		accusations.<br>If these professions whose reputations for service are 
		long established need to defend themselves, how much more is business 
		subject to suspicion and attack. The target is so broad and so 
		vulnerable at many points.<br><br>A cultivated distrust of business, in 
		fact, is often one of the most formidable obstacles in the path of 
		service, and Rotary clubs occupy a strategic position in helping to 
		overcome it. The general manager of a great corporation told one Rotary 
		club that the businessman is too often like Little Jack Horner sitting 
		in a corner and saying &quot;What a good boy am I&quot; when pointing to 
		employment provided, high taxes paid, and products or services produced. 
		&quot;A lot of our neighbors,&quot; he continued, &quot;see us as we see Little Jack. 
		We wail loudly each time new social legislation threatens our sphere of 
		action, just as Jack would howl if anyone tried to take away any of his 
		pie. Despite our calamity howling, the plum pops out quite regularly in 
		the form of good business earnings so that no one seems to believe us 
		any more.&quot;<br><br>The public relations of business is too often 
		conceived in terms of a contrived image or &quot;the engineering of consent,&quot; 
		whereas the real need is eloquent example and courageous leadership in 
		the common cause of human betterment. A Rotarian who &quot;puts Rotary to 
		work where he works&quot;—a Rotary club that singles out some local leader 
		for a vocational service award or opens the offices and factories of its 
		members for a tour of frank inspection by school teachers—contributes 
		more to understanding and respect for business than any amount of breast 
		beating and mutual admiration. Indeed, if business does need an image, 
		one of soul-searching and even self-criticism is most likely to arouse a 
		sympathetic response.<br><br>Can—or should—business aspire to the status 
		of a profession? The question produces constant and fruitful debate. 
		Present trends lend urgency to the quest for an answer. Even though 
		profit is still the accepted prize in the great game of business, how 
		the game is played, rather than the amount of the prize, is increasingly 
		the concern of businessmen. The growth of educational requirements for 
		business employment and the accumulating body of technical knowledge in 
		each field suggest comparison with the professions. And, perhaps most 
		significant of all, membership in trade associations arouses in 
		businessmen a feeling of common loyalty and responsibility for the 
		dignity of their calling.<br><br>One difference, however, does exist 
		between business and the professions. By licensing the right to 
		practice, the professions are shielded from the competition of 
		unqualified individuals. In most business, by contrast, anyone 
		possessing the minimum of cash or credit can get into the game.<br><br>
		Accordingly, the attitude that businessmen take toward their competitors 
		is crucial to the success of their efforts in dignifying an occupation.<br>
		<br>Who in your community would you nominate to receive a public award<br>
		<br>for exemplifying the ideal of service in his or her daily work?</td>
