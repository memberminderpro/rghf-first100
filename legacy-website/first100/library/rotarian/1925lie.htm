		<br class="auto-style28">&quot;If,&quot; I replied, &quot;I inadvertently 
		walked off with some of your cheap pencils you may be assured that the 
		act <br>was purely absent&#8209;minded concentration on some of the great problems 
		of the day, <br>matters of deep import on which I was, no doubt, engaged at 
		the time to which you refer. <br>I may add that I have no recollection of 
		committing this petty theft of which you complain.&quot;<br><br><strong>By Harry 
		Botsford<br></strong><br>I entered the large and impressive private office of my 
		friend, Eversharp Burroughs, just as he pulled a long ribbon of rustling 
		paper from the protesting interior of a complex and intricate 
		calculating machine. He surveyed the strip of paper with what appeared 
		to be savage satisfaction and then pressed a button and the machine 
		subsided its rustling ticking and low&#8209;voiced clacking with a tired sigh. 
		I sighed in sympathy; one did feel that way after spending a few hours 
		in the company of Eversharp Burroughs, the world's most renowned 
		statistician and eminent business philosopher and prophet.<br>
		<br>He surveyed me grimly. He waved the strip of paper, before my eyes 
		and unintelligible sounds came from his throat. Prolonged speech 
		threatened, and recognizing the symptoms I protested: &quot;Really, 
		Eversharp, I only dropped in for just a minute. In a terrible rush and 
		all that sort of thing. No less than seven editors are keeping the wires 
		hot urging me to write feature articles for them. Must push along, old 
		bean. Just dropped in to sharpen a dozen or so pencils with your most 
		excellent pencil&#8209;sharpener. Rushed to death if you know what I mean.&quot;<br>
		<br>&quot;Liar!&quot; declaimed Eversharp, heatedly. &quot;What is that thick envelope 
		protruding from your pocket?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er&#8209;er&#8209;er, a&#8209;a rejection,&quot; answered 
		with all of the dignity I could assume.<br><br>He chuckled. A mean sort 
		of a chuckle it was.<br><br>&quot;Besides,&quot; he said tartly, &quot;You never owned 
		a dozen pencils in your life. My secretary tells me that the last time 
		you were in here an inventory of pencils taken immediately after you 
		left disclosed the fact that three of the finest were missing. Have you 
		anything to say in defense?&quot;<br><br>&quot;If,&quot; I replied, &quot;I inadvertently 
		walked off with some of your cheap pencils you may be assured that the 
		act <br>was purely absent&#8209;minded concentration on some of the great problems 
		of the day, <br>matters of deep import on which I was, no doubt, engaged at 
		the time to which you refer. <br>I may add that I have no recollection of 
		committing this petty theft of which you complain.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A. very 
		fishy explanation,&quot; he commented. &quot;However, knowing that you have plenty 
		of leisure I propose to give you the advantage of the information which 
		this paper contains &#8209; the net result of a month's time and concentration 
		by my very large and efficient office force. I have reached the 
		astounding conclusion that if all the lies that the average man told in 
		the course of one month were placed, end to end, they would reach from 
		the center of Orion to a point slightly Southwest of Mishawaka, Indiana, 
		and thence in a northerly direction to the Municipal Cyclone Cellar of 
		Zero Falls, Alaska!&quot;<br><br>&quot;My dear friend!&quot; I protested after 
		considering fully the import of the information volunteered, &quot;This 
		constant juggling of figures and this constant perusal of cycles, and 
		business charts has been too much for you. No doubt your once mighty 
		intellect is reeling on its throne; unquestionably the hand that rocks 
		the adding machine is suffering from growing inertia. You are, my dear 
		Eversharp, suffering from a complex of some malignant nature. The thing 
		for you to do is to be phy&#8209;&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bunk! Nonsense!&quot; he retorted in his 
		firm, domineering manner. &quot;I'm far saner than you are. I say all men are 
		liars &#8209; otherwise this land would be filled with weeping and wailing and 
		gnashing of teeth and business and professional life would be at a very 
		low ebb and unhappiness would flood the world.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You are a cheap 
		cynic!&quot; I charged.<br>
		<img src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/library/rotarian/images/25-06WeLiePic_1.jpg"><br>&quot;I am not afraid to face facts,&quot; he stated. &quot;I 
		say that life would be unsupportable without lying; I state that much 
		unhappiness would result if these lies were not told. I am not a 
		crusader; while the facts I have uncovered about the art and science and 
		extent of lying are interesting they do not represent a cause for real 
		alarm.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lies,&quot; I recalled, &quot;went out of fashion as business and 
		professional tools, along with Gladstone collars and suspenders.&quot;<br>
		<br>&quot;You are like the rest of them,&quot; he said. &quot;You have reached a point 
		where you lie and accept lies unconsciously. <br>More and better lies are 
		being told every day.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You may be right. But I doubt it, it does 
		not seem possible,&quot; I faltered. Past experience has taught <br>that arguing 
		with Eversharp Burroughs is a futile waste of time and energy.<br><br>
		&quot;Touching on that rejection you carry in your pocket,&quot; he resumed 
		intently. &quot;May I see the letter the editor wrote you. I merely wish to 
		prove to you that lying is done now and then by the best of men and, in 
		the so&#8209;called profession of literature untruths are often and frequently 
		told in the guise of golden phrases.&quot;<br><br>“You're dead wrong there! I 
		defended. &quot;Editors are gentlemen of high moral character. <br>They would not 
		stoop to lie or trifle with the truth.&quot;<br><br>He examined the letter 
		and chuckled softly. &quot;I thought so,&quot; he ejaculated joyfully. &quot;He says 
		that he returns your most interesting story because his publication is 
		well supplied with material at present and he hopes you will experience 
		no difficulty in disposing of it elsewhere and signs himself 'Your 
		obedient servant.' Now I have on my desk a letter from this very same 
		editor asking me for an article. That proves that he is not well 
		supplied. Now do you really suppose he really hopes you dispose of the 
		article? Don't you suppose this letter is probably known as ‘Form 
		567890’ in his office and sent out with all rejections? Eh? And do you 
		suppose he, for one measly moment, considers himself as your obedient 
		servant? Eh? Try treating him like a servant and see what happens! Order 
		him to pay you thirty cents a <br>word for some of your mediocre outbursts. 
		Do you know that my analysis has proven <br>that during the course of an 
		eight&#8209;hour day that the average editor tells &#8209;&quot;<br><br>“Stop!” I cried 
		hoarsely. &quot;Cease! Would you destroy my faith in those with whom I deal?<br>&nbsp;Would you ruthlessly tear down the high reverence I have for editors, 
		all and sundry?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your reverence is largely built on the size of 
		the checks which editors send you,&quot;<br>&nbsp;he commented briefly and sourly &#8209; 
		and untruthfully.<br><br>&quot;But professional men, now,&quot; I asked, anxious 
		to secure other angles of his distasteful subject. <br>&quot;Surely they do not 
		lie; do they not swear a sort of an oath to tell the truth, the whole 
		truth and nothing but the truth.&quot;<br><br>“Maybe!” he admitted. &quot;Most of 
		'em forget it pretty promptly if they do. Take a doctor, for instance. 
		The patient is in pretty bad shape and if the patient doesn't realize 
		the seriousness of his state, he may recover. He asks the doctor what he 
		thinks of his condition and the doctor is bound to tell him &#8209; a lie. 
		Otherwise the patient might die. <br>And isn't it true that very often a 
		doctor tells a patient 'Now this won't hurt; <br>all you will feel will be a 
		little prick and after that no pain whatever'.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don't they!&quot; I 
		agreed heartily, bearing in mind twelve weeks spent in a sanitarium.<br>
		<br>“Exactly!” nodded Eversharp. &quot;Did I ever tell you about the time I 
		was operated on for &#8209;&quot;<br><br>&quot;Some other time,&quot; I fended. &quot;How about 
		lawyers? Do they lie?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Many a time and oft,&quot; he answered. 
		&quot;Necessary and essential lies, too. As a matter of fact the art of lying 
		owes much to the legal fraternity. Some of the best lies ever told have 
		been told by lawyers. By this I do not mean to cast aspersions on the 
		profession; far from it, as a matter of fact, they should point with 
		pride to the fact. Would they be justified in telling a client that he 
		did not stand a burglar's chance in a pending legal action? No! Why&quot;<br>
		<br>&quot;I'll bite,&quot; I said hopefully.<br><br>&quot;Because evidence and legal 
		points may come up in the action that will completely change the aspect 
		of the case,&quot; he answered. &quot;Such is very often the case. It is usually 
		worth while to bring any case to trial although it may not be sound 
		policy to tell the client that, as conditions exist, no chance to win 
		appears to present itself. <br>A little lie may work out advantageously, you 
		see.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That reminds me of the time my Aunt Martha sued the 
		railroad company for a cow one of their trains hit. <br>She hired a lawyer 
		named &#8209;&quot;<br><br>&quot;Some other time, my dear fellow!&quot; interposed Eversharp. 
		&quot;Let us stick closely to the subject of lying, past, present, and 
		future. My investigation has brought forth the fact that married men are 
		much more accomplished liars than single men. <br>My analysis has further 
		information on this subject which discloses <br>the fact that the better 
		liar a man is the happier is his married life.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How do you 
		account for that?&quot; I questioned. &quot;Why? Can you prove it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am 
		not in the habit of making statements that I cannot prove,&quot; was the 
		uncompromising answer. &quot;As a married man you should instantly agree with 
		me. But like most other men you have reached a stage where you cannot 
		tell a lie when you see it &#8209; or utter it. It is policy for a married man 
		to lie frequently. It makes for happiness in the marital relations. The 
		excellent liar is a tactful individual. When my wife appears in a new 
		hat and asks me how I like it, I beam and say “Splendid!” although the 
		hat may not become her. Thus I make her very happy and thus I save the 
		cost of a new hat. The economic advantages of lying are so great that it 
		would take a truly great philosopher to fully appraise them. If there 
		are lumps in the oatmeal and my wife asks me if it is all right I affirm 
		that the mess is delicious. Otherwise there would be a row; the cook 
		would be called in and scolded and would, perhaps, leave us forthwith. 
		<br>In any event telling the truth wouldn't make the oatmeal any more 
		palatable.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What you need,&quot; I suggested, &quot;is a new cook.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A remedy we have tried no less than 
		nine times in the past six months,&quot; he countered dryly. He picked up 
		several closely typewritten sheets and again resumed the subject. &quot;When 
		it comes to automobiles, the truth is not in the automobile owner. He 
		tells of great mileage &#8209; of a speed that is not only impossible but 
		illegal. He boasts to his friends of his car's performance &#8209; and 
		privately he profanely consigns the car to the uttermost depths of a 
		certain fiery furnace. And when he starts out to buy a new car he always 
		tells the salesman that he, personally, wouldn't think of disposing of 
		the old buss but his wife is set on getting a new car. Claims that the 
		old rattletrap is as good as new. Sometimes he even convinces the 
		salesman that there is some truth in the statement &#8209; and consequently 
		the used&#8209;car market is a problem that seriously threatens the automotive 
		business.<br><br>&quot;Boasting,&quot; he continued staring at me accusingly, &quot;is 
		merely another form of telling a lie. <br>How many editors did you say were 
		wiring you to hustle along masterpieces?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er&#8209;er&#8209;five,&quot; I said 
		thickly.<br><br>&quot;That's better,&quot; he acknowledged with a nod of 
		satisfaction. &quot;All of us boast more or less and a boaster is ever a 
		liar. Briggs made some mighty clever cartoons on the subject. ‘Me and 
		Mine’ &#8209; remember them?&quot;<br><br>I nodded. &quot;But,&quot; I asked, &quot;Isn't it 
		possible for a man to do a day's business without telling a lie?&quot;<br>
		<img src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/library/rotarian/images/25-06WeLiePic_2.jpg"><br>&quot;Possible but highly improbable,&quot; he said in answer. &quot;A customer or 
		a client may call one's attention to some pet hobby of his &#8209; a blooded 
		dog, maybe; or he, may raise peonies &#8209; the lowest form of flower in all 
		the world in my humble opinion. 'He asks my opinion on the dog or the 
		flower or the whatnot. Do I frankly tell him I'm not interested or that 
		his choice is unfortunate and in poor taste? Not if I value his 
		business! Neither do I refrain from comment. I lie, deliberately and 
		tactfully and I praise his hobby, his choice and his good taste. And I 
		get and keep his business and he esteems me as a person of rare 
		discrimination. And so it is with the butcher, the baker, the 
		candle-stick&#8209;maker, the dentist, the druggist and the taxicab driver; we 
		play the game and toss hither and yon a choice assortment of 
		happiness&#8209;breeding lies and half&#8209;truths.<br>Otherwise civilization would 
		reel on its throne.<br><br>&quot;Understand I am of the opinion that lies are 
		dangerous and not at all ethical; but what I am getting at is that they 
		are necessary if one desires to get through life smoothly. A comedy was 
		once written about the serious circumstances that would prevail if a 
		business man told the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth 
		for a few days. Say, that chap got himself into all sort of difficulties 
		and he nearly lost his friends and his fiancée.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I remember it,&quot; 
		I agreed. &quot;Well, well, old fellow, I certainly have enjoyed this little 
		talk! Must be rushing along now. Plenty of work staring me in the face. 
		Rushed, if you know what I mean. Three editors are keeping the wires hot 
		asking for feature stuff. Sorry and all that sort of thing; I'd like to 
		stay and hear more of this investigation but I haven't the time.&quot;<br>
		<br>He leaned forward in his chair and deftly removed from my vest 
		pocket a pencil <br>I had absent&#8209;mindedly picked up in the heat of the 
		discussion.<br><br>&quot;Now, why not let both of these editors wait a 
		while?&quot; he pleaded. &quot;I'd like to show you some special and particular 
		data in regard to lies that I haven't touched on as yet. For example, in 
		the real&#8209;estate and insurance business alone, <br>we find that the average 
		salesman tells on the average of &#8209;&quot;<br><br>&quot;Really!&quot; I protested. &quot;I 
		must be pushing along. Can't keep an editor waiting you know, especially 
		after <br>he has sent you a wire. I'd like to stay; honestly, I would. But I 
		must get that article out.&quot;<br><br>At the door he laid a detaining hand 
		on my shoulder. &quot;Listen,&quot; he whispered, &quot;I haven't told you the really 
		high points of this investigation. Wait just a moment. I want to tell 
		you what we discovered about untruths in the advertising field, at the 
		marriage&#8209;license bureaus. And you'll be astounded when I spring the real 
		facts in the building trades as it pertains to contractors. And what I 
		can tell you about summer resort advertising. And fishermen! Say, out in 
		Michigan –<br><br>I cast off the detaining hand. &quot;I'm going,&quot; I said 
		firmly. &quot;I must go. I have work to do. <br>I have an idea for an article 
		that I want to whip into shape while it is fresh.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I'm real 
		sorry to see you go,&quot; he said genially. 'Very sorry. By the way whom are 
		you writing this article for?&quot;<br><br>&quot;For THE ROTARIAN,&quot; I answered 
		promptly.<br><br>&quot;Think they'll take it?&quot; he asked anxiously following 
		me down the hall to the elevator.<br><br>&quot;I'm sure of it,&quot; I said 
		confidently, poking the bell button.<br><br>&quot;There's a certain term they 
		use in golf,&quot; he said irrelevantly. <br>&quot;It should be used in a coat of arms 
		worn by every business man. <br><br>&quot;What is it?&quot; I asked just as the 
		elevator boy slammed the door.<br><br>I don't know much about golf. I've 
		asked a number of golf fiends and so far I've garnered no information 
		worth while. <br>The other day I put the matter seriously before a friend of 
		mine, a golf widow whose intelligence I rate highly.<br><br>&quot;That's 
		easy, she said brightly. The phrase is &quot;WE LIE ALIKE&quot;.</td>
