				When Madame Chiang Kai-shek&sup2; spoke at Madison Square Garden in 
				New York City a few years ago, she significantly said, &quot;We live 
				in the present, we dream of the future, but we learn from the 
				past.&quot; What a lesson that holds for Rotarians! &quot;What is past is 
				prologue to the future&quot; &#8209; yet how many of us know the dramatic 
				incidents which have provided milestones in the development of 
				Rotary?<br><br>There are many Rotarians today who are deeply 
				concerned about the future. They feel that we are in the midst 
				of another crisis when we must soon decide whether we shall 
				again emphasize the importance of individual action, or see 
				Rotary largely expressed through corporate action. They insist 
				that Rotary as an organization must &quot;do something.&quot;<br><br>How 
				many know, for example, that Rotary faced a great crisis in 1913 
				and again in 1923? Had very wise decisions not been made, 
				possibilities for future usefulness and growth might very well 
				have been destroyed. And how many know the interesting story 
				back of the selection of the name &quot;Rotary International&quot;?<br>
				<br>Let us, then, glance back and from the lessons of the past 
				be fortified and guided in making the decisions today which many 
				believe are necessary if Rotary is to go forward to greater 
				influence.<br><br>
				<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/library/rotarian/images/49-02SevenMPic1.jpg" style="float: left">1911 &#8209; The Rotarian Is Born. Early in 1911 Paul 
				P. Harris wrote an essay on &quot;<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/philosophy/harris/1911rational.htm">Rotarianism</a>&quot; which he thought might 
				well be distributed to the handful of Rotarians in the United 
				States. Secretary Chesley R. Perry had the bright idea of 
				publishing it in a periodical which might or might not continue. 
				Before long The National Rotarian, Vol. 1, No. 1, journeyed 
				forth with Paul Harris' message, together with news of Club 
				activities, personal items, and editorials.<br><br>The 
				underlying significance of the inauspicious event in 1911 is 
				that a device was created which recognized the importance of the 
				individual Rotarian, irrespective of Club, District, national, 
				or geographic lines, for the official magazine goes from the 
				center of the organization directly to the individual Rotarian. 
				We can today say of our magazine what someone said of 
				Shakespeare: it &quot;needs not praise but comprehension only.&quot;<br>
				<br>
				<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/library/rotarian/images/49-02SevenMPic2.jpg" style="float: left">1913 &#8209; The First Crisis. For several years after Rotary was 
				founded by 
				<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1910harris/">Paul Harris</a>,
				<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/index.php/and-more-histories/the-room-711">February 23, 1905</a>, great emphasis was 
				placed on advancing the business interests of Rotarians by 
				sharing business with each other. Some Clubs actually designated 
				a Rotarian to act as statistician, who kept a record of business 
				each member received from others. At the 1913 Convention in 
				Buffalo, New York, President 
				<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1912mead">Glenn C. Mead</a> made very clear what 
				some Rotarians had been thinking and saying &#8209; viz., that Rotary 
				could not survive if this selfish approach continued. He 
				declared that service rather than material gain should be the 
				cardinal principle of Rotary. And his views were strongly 
				supported by
				<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1914mulholland">Frank L. Mulholland</a>,
				<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1913greiner/">Russell F. Greiner</a>, and
				<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1915albert">Allen 
				D. Albert</a>, all of whom later became Presidents.<br><br>As a 
				result of this forceful emphasis, the concept of &quot;the importance 
				of the individual&quot; took on a new meaning in Rotary.<br>
				<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/library/rotarian/images/49-02SevenMPic3.jpg" style="float: left"><br>1915 
				- A Financial Problem Solved. Rotary was almost bankrupt in 
				1915: Frank Mulholland, then President, realizing the 
				seriousness and urgency of the situation, conceived the simple 
				idea of asking Rotarians each to contribute a dollar. This 
				commonsense method of raising a sizable amount of money proved 
				quite successful; Rotary has not been financially embarrassed 
				since that time.<br><br>1921 &#8209; A New Name. In June, 1921, 
				President 
				<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1921mccullough">Crawford C. McCullough
				</a>headed a group of Rotarians who 
				had an audience with King George V at Buckingham Palace. Among 
				those present were
				<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1923gundaker">Guy Gundaker</a>,
				<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1912mead">Glenn Mead</a>,
				<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1914mulholland">Frank Mulholland</a>,
				<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1916klumph">Arch C. Klumph</a>,
				<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/secretariat/chapin/">Rufus F. Chapin</a>, and Arthur Chadwick. After 
				Rotary ideals had been explained to King George he is reported 
				to have said, &quot;I want to see Rotary International spread to 
				every corner of the British Empire.&quot;<br><br>
				<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/library/rotarian/images/49-02SevenMPic4.jpg" style="float: left">In 1921, when a 
				Committee of Thirty&#8209;One met in Chicago to rewrite the 
				Constitution and Bylaws of Rotary, someone must have recalled 
				that interview with King George. &quot;Why not,&quot; he asked, &quot;change 
				our name from the International Association of Rotary Clubs to 
				Rotary International?&quot; The idea caught on and &quot;Rotary 
				International&quot; was written into the Constitution adopted at the 
				1922 
				<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/conventions/1922">Convention in Los Angeles</a>. In the light of what has 
				transpired since, many believe that the movement was given 
				impetus and vision by this action.<br><br>
				<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/library/rotarian/images/49-02SevenMPic5.jpg" style="float: left"><a name="1923res34">1923</a> &#8209; Another Crisis Met. It was not long after Rotary was founded that Paul Harris 
				expressed the hope that Rotary Clubs would embark on a program 
				of civic activities and community betterment. Boys work in 
				aiding crippled children so captured the imagination that many 
				had come to believe it to be the whole work of Rotary.<br><br>
				The Convention at St. Louis in 1923 debated the question, then 
				adopted the now&#8209;famous 
				<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/history/headings/res_23-34.htm">Resolution 34</a>, which clarified our 
				thinking by stipulating that:<br><br>No Club should allow any 
				Community Service activities to obscure the Objects of Rotary or 
				jeopardize the primary purpose for which a Rotary Club is 
				organized.<br><br>Activities which enlist the individual efforts of 
				all Rotarians generally are more in accord with the genius of 
				Rotary than those only requiring the mass action of the Club, 
				because the Community Service activities of a Rotary Club should 
				be regarded only as a laboratory experiment designed to train 
				members of a Rotary Club in service.<br><br>Again the importance 
				of the individual Rotarian can be seen influencing the course 
				for the future of Rotary.<br><br>
				<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/library/rotarian/images/49-02SevenMPic6.jpg" style="float: left">1927 &#8209; The A. &amp; 0. Committee. 
				<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/history/headings/aims.htm">While the Aims and Objects Plan was adopted by Rotary 
				International</a> at the Ostend, Belgium, Convention in 1927, its 
				history goes back several years to one Sunday morning. Sydney W. 
				Pascall, then President of Rotary International in Great Britain 
				and Ireland, and Vivian Carter were walking through a woods in 
				Surrey, England, and the discussion turned to Rotary education. 
				Sydney deplored the Rotary ignorance of the average Rotarian, 
				and outlined a plan to make the Rotary Educational Committee 
				more effective.<br><br>These two men later exchanged letters 
				which led finally to the putting down on a half sheet of paper 
				what became known later as the Aims and Objects Plan. The scheme 
				was tried out for 12 months in the Rotary Clubs of Britain and 
				Ireland and more than half the Clubs adopted it. Later Vivian 
				came to Chicago and, using a blackboard, explained the plan to 
				the Board, which submitted it to the Ostend Convention.<br><br>
				It is interesting to note that the original A. &amp; 0. Plan 
				contemplated only three lines of activity: Club Service, 
				Community Service and Boys Work, and Vocational Service. In 
				1928, at Minneapolis, International Service was added.<br><br>At 
				Nice, France, in 1937 the Bylaws were again amended to do away 
				with the separate Committees for the Services. Now one member of 
				the Aims and Objects Committee is responsible for each of the 
				four.<br><br>
				<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/library/rotarian/images/49-02SevenMPic7.jpg" style="float: left">1933 &#8209; Revista Rotaria. The first of what may be 
				several non&#8209;English editions of THE ROTARIAN, very appropriately 
				named REVISTA ROTARIA, was published in Spanish. Since then it 
				has gained steadily in reader interest and has been a major 
				factor in the growth of Rotary in Ibero&#8209;America.<br><br>
				1949 &#8209; Where Tomorrow?<br><br>There are many Rotarians today who 
				are deeply concerned about the future. They feel that we are in 
				the midst of another crisis when we must soon decide whether we 
				shall again emphasize the importance of individual action, or 
				see Rotary largely expressed through corporate action. They 
				insist that Rotary as an organization must &quot;do something.&quot;<br>
				<br>Those who make these demands fail to realize that Rotary's 
				position and influence in the world will never be more than the 
				reflection of the individual Rotarian. The individual's 
				application of Rotary's ideals is, it seems to me, more 
				important than corporate activities at the Club or top level.<br>
				<br>We don't have to sponsor something to make Rotary a living 
				force. We can individually make it so. There is truth in the 
				statement that &quot;Through the power of the individual a new age 
				will stir and be formed. No new age has been formed in any other 
				way.&quot;<br><br>The great opportunity facing the more than 320,000 
				Rotarians today is to expand the area of decency and 
				understanding in all the relationships of life among all the 
				peoples of the world. This is enough to command our best 
				thinking and acting.<br><br>What we do as individuals in giving 
				life and meaning to Rotary is the only worthy measuring rod by 
				which we should want the world to judge us.<br><br>Madge 
				Jenison&sup3; once said, &quot;Give the world something with character and 
				it will carry your name to the sunset.&quot; If we, as Rotarians, 
				live up in full measure to the opportunities and 
				responsibilities of Rotary membership, we can truly hope that 
				the world will carry the name of Rotary to the sunset, The road 
				will be easier and the pace quicker if we learn from the lessons 
				of the past 44 years.<br><br>&sup1; Ralph S. Dunne , RC Bala 
				Cynwyd-Narbeht, was Governor of District 179 in 1945-46<br><br>&sup2; 
				<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/library/rotarian/madamechiang.htm">Soong Mei-ling</a> 
				(1897 - 2003) was born in China and educated in 
				the United States. She married Chiang Kai-shek in 1927. In 1943, 
				she spoke before the United States congress. She is considered 
				one of the most politically important women in history.<br><br>&sup3;
