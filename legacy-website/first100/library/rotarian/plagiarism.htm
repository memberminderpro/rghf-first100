		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">Secretary Borroughs' article in the 
		Round Table of the March issue has not brought forth any response. 
		Perhaps it is because the Rotarians are such busy men that they do not 
		have time to give visible expression to the thoughts which they have on 
		some of these Rotary matters. The Rotary club is made up of probably the 
		busiest men in each community. It is entirely natural then for their 
		communications to THE ROTARIAN to be few and far between. It is at the 
		conventions and in the club meetings that all their pent up ideas burst 
		forth and make the atmosphere crackle as though an electric storm was in 
		progress.<br><br>Secretary Borroughs protested against the appropriation 
		of printed thoughts or literary productions from one club by another 
		club without due credit being given. Is this necessary? I suppose some 
		of the things that I have written in connection with Rotary have been 
		quoted as extensively as anything else that has been written. 
		Personally, I have no desire for credit for the things which I have 
		written in Rotary. They are mostly expressions of ideas which are common 
		to many of us in and outside Rotary. We all ought to give generously to 
		each other of the best thought which we have in Rotary. For example, we 
		all know that attendance at meetings is a requisite in Rotary. We have 
		all expressed the thought in a hundred different ways. What matters it, 
		if one club likes another club's expression a little better than its own 
		and uses it in its notices or local publication? The purpose is not to 
		get credit for having written something, but to stimulate local interest 
		in the club work.<br><br>It is rather disconcerting, however, to 
		discover that some club, endeavoring to give credit where credit is due, 
		quotes as author of a paragraph or of an article not the authors &#8209; but 
		some other club which has borrowed it. For example, the Houston club, in 
		their bulletin, ran various paragraphs from my article, &quot;What is the 
		Rotary Club.&quot; They scattered these paragraphs through their bulletin as 
		fillers on different pages. I thought it was very effective work and was 
		very much tickled to think that my article could be worked in so 
		cleverly as filler in a local publication. My first particular jolt came 
		when one of my assistants in the office referred to one of those 
		paragraphs in the Houston bulletin as one of the best things he had ever 
		seen written on the subject, absolutely oblivious to the fact that he 
		was handing me something which I, myself, had written and which was 
		being sent out of this office nearly every day. Then came a succession 
		of small jars as I discovered that different Rotary club publications 
		were republishing these paragraphs from the Houston bulletin and 
		crediting them to the Houston Rotary Club.<br><br>However, all this is 
		accidental and merely amusing and if I am as generous and big hearted as 
		I try to make myself believe I am, I ought not to be worried in the 
		slightest degree on account of the Houston club getting the credit for 
		having produced my stuff. The law of compensation works inevitably, and 
		so this week I observe in another club publication that I am given 
		credit for originating the idea of observing the anniversary of Rotary 
		with joint meetings of the various clubs, when, as a matter of fact, I 
		am sure that Paul Harris and Glenn Mead deserve the credit for that 
		idea.<br><br>Conclusion: It is wrong knowingly to present the literary 
		work of another as our own production, but it is permissible to 
		&quot;exchange freely&quot; in Rotary. In giving credit, be sure you give it to 
		the author and not to some borrower. It is better not to give credit at 
		all than to give it to the wrong person, club or publication.<br><br>
		There is another phase of this question and that is the taking of 
		quotations from Rotarians of other cities and publishing them with the 
		names of local members as the authors. Where this is done &quot;with malice 
		aforethought,&quot; as the old saying is, it is dishonest and utterly 
		abhorrent to the principles of Rotarianism. It should be promptly and 
		sternly discouraged, not so much because of the unfairness to the man 
		whose writings or thoughts were deliberately and knowingly appropriated, 
		but it is an injustice to the man whose name is tacked on as the author 
		for undoubtedly he is an innocent and embarrassed victim of some other 
		fellow's misrepresentation.<br><br>C. R. P . (Chesley R. Perry, General 
		Secretary, Rotary International, 1910-1942)</td>
