		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">Rotaract, Rotary International's 
		service club program for young adults ages 18-30, was officially 
		inaugurated during January 1968 under RI President Luther Hodges. On 13 
		March 1968, the Rotaract Club of the University of North Carolina, 
		sponsored by the Rotary Club of North Charlotte, North Carolina, USA, 
		was the first Rotaract club to receive its official charter. Although 
		this club is recognized as the first Rotaract club, Rotarians have been 
		sponsoring similar organizations for young adults since the early 1920s.<br>
		<br>The earliest known predecessors to Rotaract, Twenty-Thirty clubs, 
		were first sponsored by the Rotary Club of Sacramento, California, USA. 
		The clubs were based on the principles and goals of their sponsoring 
		Rotary clubs, and membership was open to young professionals and 
		university students. The first meeting of a Twenty-Thirty club was held 
		on 19 December 1922. At one point, the movement claimed as many as 125 
		clubs under the sponsorship of California Rotary clubs, and published a 
		monthly magazine.<br><br>In 1927, Round Table clubs were founded in 
		Great Britain and Ireland. Membership in Round Table clubs was open to 
		young men ages 18 to 40, and by 1935, there more than 90 Round Table 
		clubs existed. In November 1930, the first Apex club was formed in 
		Geelong, Australia. Apex clubs grew rapidly, expanding to more than 20 
		clubs in just a few years. These clubs were sponsored by Rotary clubs, 
		and were open to professionals and students between the ages of 18 and 
		35.<br><br>Similar Rotary club-sponsored groups continued to spring up 
		simultaneously and independently around the globe. Unisserve clubs in 
		India, Orbis clubs in South America, Rotors clubs in South Africa, Paul 
		Harris Circles in Europe, and Quadrant clubs in the United States are 
		some of the best-known examples. Eventually, these clubs would provide 
		the base for the future growth of Rotaract as the clubs adopted new 
		names under the Rotaract program.<br><br>Perhaps the greatest impetus 
		for the creation of the Rotaract program came from Rotary's youth 
		service club for secondary school students, Interact clubs. Established 
		in 1962, the Interact program enjoyed immediate success. However, since 
		membership was only open to students in secondary schools, graduated 
		Interactors and Rotarians were soon looking for ways to extend their 
		relationship. Several proposals were brought before the RI Board of 
		Directors to allow membership in Interact clubs to extend for a few 
		years after graduation. Instead of extending the age requirements for 
		Interact, the Board decided to study the feasibility of creating a new 
		service club program for young adults at the university and young 
		professional level.<br><br>The decision to adopt the Rotaract program 
		came at a time when student protests worldwide were of growing concern 
		to Rotarians. The Rotaract program was adopted not only as means of 
		keeping former Interactors within the Rotary family, but as a means of 
		channeling the energies of young adults into positive activities that 
		could benefit their communities.<br><br>A special committee was convened 
		to design the new service club program for young adults during 1966. 
		After polling students at the University of Houston, Texas, USA, the 
		committee decided that &quot;Rotaract&quot; would be the best name for the program 
		— a combination of the words &quot;Rotary&quot; and &quot;action.&quot; Coincidentally, the 
		service club at the University of North Carolina had already adopted the 
		name in 1966, but they coined it as a combination of the names &quot;Rotary&quot; 
		and &quot;Interact.&quot; The committee also decided that young women should be 
		allowed to join on equal standing with male members at the discretion of 
		the sponsoring Rotary club.<br><br><strong>Today, Rotaract continues to 
		experience phenomenal growth. There are currently more than 8,000 
		Rotaract clubs in 155 countries and geographic areas, with an estimated 
		membership of more than 186,000 Rotaractors. As the program continues to 
		grow, Rotaractors repeatedly show that they are prepared for &quot;Fellowship 
		Through Service.&quot;<br></strong><br>Within a day of the certification of 
		the Rotaract Club of the University of North Carolina, the Rotaract Club 
		of the University of La Salle was chartered in Tacubaya, Mexico. The 
		Rotaract Clubs of Florence, Italy, Gaston College, North Carolina, and 
		Secunderabad, India, were all certified in the following weeks. The 
		young adults' clubs that had already existed in many regions fueled the 
		rapid growth of Rotaract for the first few years.<br><br>By 1981, 
		Rotaract was so popular that Rotaractors in South Africa decided to host 
		the first INTEROTA conference, an international meeting for all 
		Rotaractors. Subsequent conferences have been held every three years. To 
		date, INTEROTA conferences have been hosted by Rotaractors in South 
		Africa, Australia, England, Turkey, Mexico, and Brazil. The next 
		conference is set for Munich, Germany, in 2005. International meetings 
		for Rotaractors are also held every year at the Rotaract Preconvention 
		Meeting that precedes Rotary's annual convention. The first such meeting 
		was held in Seoul, Korea, in 1989, with more than 450 Rotaractors in 
		attendance.<br><br>Several developments in the early 1990s helped 
		strengthen the Rotaract movement. In February 1991, the first Rotaract 
		club in Eastern Europe was chartered in Budapest, Hungary, with the help 
		of Austrian Rotaractors. Ties with Eastern Europe were further 
		strengthened when the same Austrian Rotaractors helped charter the 
		Rotaract Club of Prague in what was then Czechoslovakia later in 1991. 
		In March 1992, the RI Board established World Rotaract Week, which is 
		celebrated annually during the week of 13 March to commemorate the 
		chartering of the first Rotaract club. During World Rotaract Week, 
		Rotaractors attend meetings with their sponsoring Rotary clubs, 
		undertake joint service projects, and speak with clubs that do not 
		sponsor Rotaract clubs about the benefits of the program.<br><br>Since 
		1968, Rotaractors have continually shown that they can be an innovative 
		and positive force for change in their communities. Service activities 
		commonly undertaken include projects to improve the environment, visits 
		with the elderly or disabled, blood or organ donation campaigns, and aid 
		to developing countries. One example of the ingenuity employed by 
		Rotaractors is a project undertaken by the Rotaract Clubs of Heemstede 
		and Hillegom-Lissee, the Netherlands, in 1987. In order to raise funds 
		for PolioPlus, Rotaractors from the two clubs designed an amphibious 
		cycle that would cross the English Channel under the power of 36 
		Rotaractors. The campaign raised US$210,000 for PolioPlus and earned the 
		Rotaractors a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for their 
		speedy crossing.<br><br>Today, Rotaract continues to experience 
		phenomenal growth. There are currently more than 7,600 Rotaract clubs in 
		more than 158 countries, with an estimated membership of more than 
		176,000 Rotaractors. As the program continues to grow, Rotaractors 
		repeatedly show that they are prepared for &quot;Fellowship Through Service.&quot;</td>
