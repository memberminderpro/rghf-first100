		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">From Chapter X ‘The Challenge’, 
		page 48 of the PDF copy: <br><br>‘In Australia, a youth movement, 
		founded on Rotary principles, is well under way, and they also have high 
		ambitions for extension to other countries.’ <br><br>‘The writer hopes 
		that the organizations of the Rotary type now in existence will increase 
		until the time arrives when there will be clubs for all business and 
		professional men and women and youths who are imbued with the ideal of 
		service. Was it something like that you had in mind, Mr. Chesterton, 
		when you coined the phrase, “This Rotarian Age&quot;?’ <br><br>From Chapter 
		XIII ‘How do Members View Their Privileges? Page 73 of the PDF copy: <br>
		<br>‘Rotary aims to encourage the enrollment of young members. Youth is 
		enthusiastic and determined and contributes much to the movement. Youth, 
		middle age, and old age all have their parts to play, and all can profit 
		greatly in their contacts with each other. In many instances, the 
		abundant energies of youth and capital supplied by older members have 
		been combined with telling effect.’ <br><br>Also the following two 
		sections <br><br>From Chapter XII ‘Is the Rotary Concept of a World at 
		Peace Utopian’ pages 61 to 62 of the PDF copy: <br><br>‘In April 1931, a 
		most interesting inter-country meeting was observed in South America, 
		when the 63rd (Argentina-Paraguay-Uruguay) and 64th (at that time 
		comprised of clubs in both Chile and Bolivia) districts held a joint 
		conference at Puente de Inca, Argentina. <br><br>Particularly 
		significant, however, was the meeting of Rotarians of Argentina and 
		Uruguay in December 1932 at Montevideo. This inter-country Rotary 
		meeting was held for the particular purpose of maintaining friendly 
		relations at a time when official diplomatic relations had already been 
		severed. Since the abovementioned meetings took place, inter-country 
		meetings have been too numerous to mention, and the campaign for 
		goodwill and understanding has been carried into the ranks of the young 
		manhood of many countries. Youth is impressionable. Impressions received 
		at the time when character is forming often last for life. <br><br>
		Rotarians interested in the promotion of goodwill have therefore turned 
		their attention to young people of the school age, endeavoring to bring 
		about opportunity for travel in foreign countries leading to 
		acquaintanceships that frequently ripen into permanent friendships. <br>
		<br>One of the first organized efforts in this respect was the tour of 
		the Young Australia League to the United States. The Young Australia 
		League was founded by a member of the Rotary Club of Perth, Australia. 
		One of the purposes was to provide “Education by Travel” to a select 
		group of Australian boys, members of the League, through annual 
		pilgrimage to different countries. Many of the boys were Sons of 
		Rotarians. <br><br>In January 1929, one hundred and sixty of these boys 
		undertook a trip to the United States, landing in San Francisco, 
		traveling through the southern part of the United States to New Orleans, 
		thence to New York, Chicago, and through Canada, embarking after five 
		months from Vancouver for Australia. <br><br>The boys, as ambassadors of 
		goodwill, were received and entertained by the Rotary clubs in the 
		United States and Canada on their itinerary. After returning home, they 
		wrote many letters to their hosts, proving that the tour accomplished 
		its primary objective. <br><br>One of the young men of the League, while 
		in San Francisco, was taken seriously ill with rheumatic fever. The 
		contingent was due to sail for home in a few days and it was quite 
		impossible to delay it until the youth recovered. Into the breach, 
		stepped a San Francisco Rotarian and his good wife, who took charge of 
		the lad, and after seven anxious weeks of fathering and mothering him, 
		brought him to the convalescent stage, and soon after he was able to 
		sail home to his parents, fully recovered. Who can express in mere words 
		the extreme value of the service this Rotarian family rendered to an 
		Australian family 7,000 miles away? It is certain that such kindnesses 
		lavished by Rotarians and their families have planted in the breasts of 
		hundreds of young men, seeds of memory that will grow into trees of 
		goodwill, and produce much fruit of sympathy, tolerance, and 
		understanding. <br><br>The leaders of the Young Australia League came in 
		the spring of 1932 to the United States and organized a group of 
		American boys under the name of Young America League for a return visit 
		to Australia. This group—because of prevailing economic conditions—was 
		not so large as the Australian group, but the members were splendidly 
		entertained by Australian Rotarians in all cities that they visited <br>
		<br>Excellent means of developing international understanding are 
		contacts through sport. Realizing this fact, President Muller of the 
		Rotary Club of Davos, Switzerland, has brought together teams from the 
		following countries to compete in hockey matches at Davos: Austria, 
		Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, 
		Poland, Spain, and Sweden. <br><br>Another adventure in international 
		friendship is international summer camps for young men. In the summer of 
		1931, the Boys Work committee of the 54th district, Switzerland, under 
		the presidency of Rotarian Gabriel Rauch of the Geneva Club, conducted 
		the first Swiss camp for sons of Rotarians. The party comprised boys 
		from thirteen countries (Germany, Italy, Austria, Belgium, Britain, 
		Denmark, Spain, Czechoslovakia, Holland, Portugal, Hungary, and French 
		and German Switzerland). <br><br>The first week was devoted to getting 
		the boys acquainted and creating friendships. Each morning thereafter, 
		there was a lecture on a social, economic, scientific, artistic, or 
		other topic. The afternoons were spent in trips into industrial plants 
		and other places of interest and in recreation such as swimming, tennis, 
		and other sports. <br><br>A tour of Switzerland filled the following two 
		weeks, with the object of making the young men acquainted with the 
		country, its beauties, its language, its industries, and its 
		inhabitants. Swiss Rotarians spared no efforts to make the sojourn 
		interesting and instructive to their young guests. <br><br>Acting upon 
		the example of Switzerland, Rotarians of other countries have made their 
		contribution to the promotion of the sixth object of Rotary by 
		organizing similar camps.<br><br>The Rotary Club of Vienna organized in 
		August 1932 an international boys camp at Tantaiier Castle near 
		Radstadt, Austria. One hundred and twenty sons of Rotarians from 
		Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Holland, Great Britain, Germany, 
		Yugoslavia, Austria, Saar Basin, Switzerland, and Hungary were thrown 
		together and housed in four large dormitories under four experienced 
		group leaders. <br><br>The camp was an unqualified success as, despite 
		the language difficulty, the various nationalities mixed in a true 
		Rotary manner, each striving to get firsthand knowledge of the other 
		boys from strange lands. <br><br>Another camp was organized by the 
		Rotary Club of Graz, Austria in the “Sudmark” Students Home. It was 
		particularly successful in starting friendships between young Austrians 
		and Yugoslavians, and also students from Czechoslovakia, England, 
		France, Germany, and Yugoslavia. <br><br>Danish Rotarians have been for 
		many years interested in the promotion of world-mindedness in young 
		people and were among the first organizers of the international exchange 
		of youth. Families of English Rotarians take as guests, children of 
		Rotarians in other, especially European countries, and send in exchange, 
		children of their own. <br><br>Essay writing contests in high schools on 
		the subject of promoting international understanding and goodwill has 
		been another means used by Rotarians to create interest in the minds of 
		young men and women in that important subject. <br><br>Prizes totaling 
		five hundred dollars were given to the successful contestants of the 
		schools of the city of Vienna, Austria, at the time of the Rotary 
		International convention in that city; and a like sum was given to the 
		successful contestants in the schools of Boston the year the convention 
		was held there. <br><br>The judges of the contests were selected from 
		professors of nearby universities who were especially well qualified to 
		act. <br><br>Another movement of the same kind, but on a larger scale, 
		is now under consideration.’ <br><br>From Chapter XV ‘Of Tomorrow’ pages 
		85-86 of the PDF copy: <br><br>‘Rotarians are appreciative of their 
		inheritance from generations that have preceded them and not forgetful 
		of their duty to generations yet to come. The methods of serving youth 
		are numerous. Some of them manifest originality of thought while others 
		follow conventional lines. Quite naturally, the Boy Scouts are the 
		favorites and many Rotarians support the movement by the expenditure of 
		time as well as money. Boys’ clubs of various types have been helped, 
		and hundreds of boys’ clubs have been organized and supported by Rotary 
		clubs. The writer visited some excellent schools for under-privileged 
		boys in South<br><br>Africa, recently. They were maintained by 
		individual Rotary clubs. Rotarians throughout the world are throwing 
		themselves enthusiastically into this activity.<br><br>Recognizing the 
		importance of education, more than two hundred student loan funds are 
		now being permanently financed by Rotary clubs. The boy of today will be 
		the man of tomorrow.<br><br>Rotary clubs have for many years financed 
		Dr. Charles E. Barker’s lectures to high school students throughout the 
		United States. In this way, it has been possible to reach approximately 
		one-half million young men and women of the critical adolescent period 
		and to take to them the most important of all messages. Of scarcely less 
		social value is Dr. Barker’s famous lecture to men, “A Father’s Duty to 
		His Son,” and to women, “A Mother’s Duty to Her Daughter.” <br><br>Boys’ 
		week was the inspiration of the Rotary Club of New York City. The “Back 
		to School” movement has been one of the activities in nearly five 
		hundred Rotary clubs. <br><br>The present attitude of the adult toward 
		the boy is quite different from the attitude of earlier generations. The 
		great aim formerly was to keep the boy in his place; the modern plan is 
		to gain his confidence and affection. It is more practicable to lead a 
		boy than to push him. A nation’s most valuable asset is its youth, and 
		it is worth studying. How can the best results be obtained? How can the 
		lives of young men and young women be so directed as to make sure of 
		their future welfare and happiness and of the stability of the 
		government that will come within their control? Taken at the 
		psychological hour it is a comparatively easy matter to switch a boy 
		from the wrong track to the right track. The Union League Club of 
		Chicago experimentally established a boys’ club in a ward that was 
		considered by the police to be one of the worst wards in Chicago, with 
		the result that crime diminished to the point of being almost 
		negligible. The boys of the ward had been switched to the right track.
		<br><br>In the day of our forefathers, there were few idle moments in 
		the life of the average boy. His services were needed on the farm, in 
		the store, or whosesoever else his life was cast. Work served not merely 
		to keep the boy out of mischief; it served also to provide him wholesome 
		discipline. Laborsaving devices have cut down the father’s hours of 
		labor and almost entirely deprived the boy of the necessity of working 
		with his hands. What is he to do to consume his restless energy? <br>
		<br>The question: “What are the boys to do with their restless energy?” 
		is being answered in part by the boys themselves in the various types of 
		youth movements. Many Americans view the hitchhiking epidemic as a 
		national menace and would suppress it by process of law. To the writer, 
		some manner of regulation seems more in order. The temporary camps seem 
		a step in the right direction. To say the least that can be said of the 
		hitchhiking development, it does serve to give energies an outlet; it 
		does give the participants an opportunity of learning something of their 
		own country, of experiencing life as it is, and last but not least it 
		provides many young men with wholesome hardships, and even with 
		characters building suffering of which many are much in need. <br><br>In 
		any event, if one is to condemn the hitchhikers, it should be some 
		person other than the writer, who in his own youth worked his way to 
		most every corner of his own country and across the Atlantic Ocean three 
		times, in search of knowledge of the world and experience in real life, 
		and suffered every manner of hardship available at that period in the 
		world’s history. What the hitch needs, in the writer’s estimation, is 
		regulation, not suppression. If adult leaders will not arise, youthful 
		leaders will. What then? <br><br>The certainty that hours of labor will 
		constitute an even smaller percentage of the day in the future is cause 
		for alarm. If hours of leisure are to exceed in number hours of labor, 
		why should education center entirely upon teaching the boy how to work? 
		It is essential that the boys of tomorrow learn how to employ their 
		leisure time. What will business success avail a boy if he lacks the 
		capacity to enjoy the fruits of his labor? Business is important, but 
		life is more than business. Culture is more than technology. Americans 
		might advantageously take a chapter from the book of Europeans. The 
		writer, after many visits abroad, has become convinced of the fact that 
		the people of the older countries view business relationship to life<br>
		<br>in saner perspective than Americans. The trouble is that Americans, 
		in the process of building up a country territorially great, have 
		speeded up productive machinery to a point where it threatens to get out 
		of control. <br><br>The development of National and State parks to lure 
		youth away from the neurotic influences of city life into the beautiful 
		out-of-doors seems to the writer to be one of the most promising 
		indications of the times. It is almost unheard of that a true lover of 
		nature is a vicious person. Nature soothes and rests tired nerves. It is 
		a refuge to fall back upon in time of stress and strain. Emerson said 
		that beauty is a necessity, and so it is as far as the higher life is 
		concerned. Let us cultivate a love of the outdoors in the hearts of our 
		boys; it will pay rich dividends. If we carry on faithfully today, the 
		coming generation will carry on faithfully tomorrow.’</td>
