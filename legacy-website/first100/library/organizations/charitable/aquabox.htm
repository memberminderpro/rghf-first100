				<td class="ms-separator">
				<p class="ms-separator">For several years up to 1990 the Rotary 
				Club of Wirksworth of Rotary District 1220 had been filling and 
				despatching Emergency Boxes under the RIBI banner. These were 
				simple flat pack plywood boxes filled and ready to send to 
				disaster areas.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="ms-separator">In 1990 a member of the Wirksworth Club 
				asked the question &quot;Why use a wooden box?&quot; It is not big enough 
				to be useful for storage and the plywood does not even make a 
				good fire. Why not have a strong plastic box that could be used 
				afterwards for storage or as a table, seat etc? Another member 
				added that with a hole in the side and a tap and purification 
				system, it could be used for producing drinking water from 
				polluted water. &nbsp;</p>
				<p><span class="ms-separator">The idea of the </span>
				<span class="style10">AQUABOX</span><span class="ms-separator"> 
				was born.</span>&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="ms-separator">Later that year, Rotarian Peter Hare 
				suggested the idea to the Club. He contemplated the possibility 
				of having it accepted by Rotary District 1220 as an approved 
				project, and that it might even be approved by RIBI. He 
				suggested that they could launch the project and get sponsorship 
				from other Rotary Clubs in the District and, perhaps, also from 
				around the UK. The club members gave approval for a full brief 
				to be prepared. &nbsp;</p>
				<p class="ms-separator">Water filters and water purification 
				tablets were off the shelf items but the box itself, to be of 
				similar size to the EMERGENCY BOX, was not readily available. 
				The only suitable box required an order of 3000 at a cost of 
				£30,000. This represented a substantial commitment but the 
				decision was made to go ahead. Support was sought from District 
				and subsequently from all Rotary Clubs in the UK under the RIBI 
				banner, whilst the members of the Rotary Club of Wirksworth 
				agreed to underwrite any shortfall.&nbsp;</p>
				<p><span class="style10">AQUABOX</span><span class="ms-separator"> 
				was launched in October 1992 and, despite the initial hesitant 
				co-operation of the Emergency Box organisation, there is now 
				full co-operation with both the Emergency Box and the Shelter 
				Box projects. In cases of natural disasters, such as in 
				Mozambique in 2000 and India in 2001, all three projects have 
				cooperated in arranging transportation facilities on a joint 
				basis.</span></p>
				<p class="ms-separator">Warehouse facilities were then 
				commissioned. &nbsp;</p>
				<p class="ms-separator">During the year 1993/4 some 1000 boxes 
				were sponsored and the initial order of 3,000 boxes was being 
				well taken up. These initial boxes were not quite as 
				satisfactory as had been hoped as they were insufficiently 
				strong and some had been found to fracture. A new stronger 
				improved box was designed and ordered. The new style boxes have 
				continued to satisfy needs since that time. </p>
				<p class="ms-separator">Unlike Emergency Boxes, which are stored 
				for distribution at the time of a disaster, water filters and 
				water purification tablets have a limited shelf life of five 
				years. Consequently, in addition to being sent to areas of 
				natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods 
				etc., they are also sent to areas of continuing need, via 
				reputable Aid Agencies who have monitors on the ground to 
				receive and properly distribute the boxes and assure full 
				utilization.&nbsp;</p>
				<p><span class="ms-separator">Rapid growth followed, 
				particularly in 1998/99 as a direct result of the 'Hurricane 
				Mitch' initiative. By the end of that year total donations had 
				increased to £426,687. Over 1000 boxes, including many </span>
				<span class="style10">AQUA30</span><span class="ms-separator">'s, 
				capable of purifying over 22 million litres of water, were 
				shipped from the UK in less than 3 months thanks to over 
				£237,000 raised within RIBI. </span>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><span class="ms-separator">Since the early launch years,
				</span><span class="style10">AQUABOX</span><span class="ms-separator"> 
				has grown and by the millennium over 20,000 boxes had been 
				provided to over 30 countries. It has become a significant 
				'business' in its own right with a dedicated distribution 
				centre. By the end of the year 2001 over 31,000 boxes had been 
				despatched.</span>&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="ms-separator">Though the project remains a stand-alone 
				operation administered by the Directors and Members of Aquabox 
				Ltd., all of who must be Members of the Rotary Club of 
				Wirksworth, there is active support from Rotary clubs throughout 
				Great Britain and Ireland and also from Inner Wheel Clubs, 
				Churches, Schools, Youth Organisations and private individuals.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="ms-separator">Due to the rapid success of the project 
				various refinements have been made over a period of years and 
				various other aid agencies have been involved in receiving and 
				monitoring boxes in areas of need.</p>
				<p class="ms-separator">By June 2000 the year's income was 
				£528,843 and during the year over 7,000 boxes had been sent 
				overseas.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="ms-separator">It was then decided that the time had 
				been reached when Aquabox should have complete control in the 
				distribution of all boxes, checking, filling and finally sending 
				them overseas.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="ms-separator">In November 2000 they leased on a bay of 
				a modern warehouse building from where all orders are now 
				despatched every Saturday morning. All returned boxes come back 
				to the private warehouse for holding EXCEPT THAT ALL BOXES ARE 
				NOW CHECKED UPON RECEIPT to ensure that they have been correctly 
				packed.&nbsp;</p>
				<h2 class="style2"><strong>Some areas assisted ....</strong></h2>
				<p><span class="ms-separator">At the end of January 2001 there 
				were 2 severe earthquakes, one in </span><span class="style11">
				El Salvador</span><span class="ms-separator"> and one in </span>
				<span class="style11">Gujarat, India</span><span class="ms-separator"> 
				when&nbsp; 960 Aquaboxes, many of them </span>
				<span class="style10">AQUA30</span><span class="ms-separator">'s, 
				were dispatched by air and a further 520 to go by sea . The 
				Methodist Missionary Society also sent a consignment of aid 
				including 158 Aquaboxes. In addition about 45 Shelter boxes and 
				about 300 Emergency boxes were also sent. </span></p>
				<p><span class="ms-separator">During March 2001, 400 boxes were 
				sent to Kosovo. The Shelter Box project also arranged for a 40ft 
				container, filled with 100 Shelter boxes, 100 Emergency boxes, 
				50 </span><span class="style10">AQUA30</span><span class="ms-separator">'s 
				and 390 Standard Aquaboxes to go to India.</span>&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="ms-separator">In 1985 the Childrens’ Aid Direct agency 
				took delivery of several hundred boxes that were sent to many 
				countries in war torn Europe, Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria and 
				later Serbia and Kosova.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="ms-separator">Boxes have also been sent to disaster 
				areas in many other countries including Honduras, Belize, Ghana, 
				Turkey, Venezuela and Mozambique, often in partnership with 
				other aid agencies. The organization has recently sent 200 boxes 
				to devastated Haiti and hopes to send a further 650 shortly.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="ms-separator">For a fuller appreciation of the work 
				carried out by the Organization check out Aquabox’s own Website.&nbsp;</p>
				<h2 class="style6"><strong>The Aquabox Overseas</strong></h2>
				<h2 class="style4"><span class="style5">During a visit to the UK in 1999 
				an Australian Rotarian heard of, and became interested in, the
				</span><span class="style7">AQUABOX</span><span class="style5"> 
				project. Consequently the Rotary Club of Eltham in the State of 
				Victoria initiated a parallel project. Their first boxes were 
				sent to Nepal. In 2003 they were able to ship a container of 
				boxes for use in Iraq.</span></h2>
				<h2 class="style6">A sister project has also been 
				set up by the Rotary Club of Stratford in Canada<o:p></o:p></h2>
				<p class="ms-separator">The Rotary Club in the Cayman Islands 
				started a similar project with an initial delivery of 24 boxes. 
				This is most commendable considering their tiny population.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="ms-separator">It is understood that a Rotary Club or 
				District in Arizona, USA have commenced a similar project.&nbsp;</p>
				<h2 class="style2"><strong>The continuing need</strong></h2>
				<p><span class="ms-separator">There is a continuing need in many 
				parts of the world for assistance in purifying water. For 
				centuries raw surface and well water has been used, which is 
				polluted from many causes, natural and otherwise. The life span 
				of many in the world is short as a result of water-borne 
				diseases. Aquaboxes have been found to provide the 'First Aid' 
				in dealing with this problem and they have, in consequence, 
				become increasingly welcomed in many parts of Africa and Asia. 
				Conscious of this ongoing need Aquabox have taken the 
				opportunity to use any income from invested funds to assist 
				Water Aid in providing long term solutions by the provision of 
				permanent bore-holes. No doubt, for many years to come, </span>
				<span class="style10">AQUABOX</span><span class="ms-separator"> 
				'First Aid' will continue to be required for ongoing needs and, 
				at the same time, continue to be ready to give immediate 
				assistance in times of specific natural disasters.</span>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><span class="ms-separator">he </span><span class="style10">
				AQUABOX GOLD</span><span class="ms-separator"> is a special 
				version of our Standard </span><span class="style10">AQUABOX</span><span class="ms-separator">. 
				It is packed by the Aquabox team and filled with new, specially 
				purchased, humanitarian goods to meet the basic needs of the 
				recipients of our Standard Aquaboxes ... and more.</span>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>T<span class="ms-separator">he box is filled to capacity 
				bringing the weight up the maximum shipping weight of 25kg.</span></p>
				<p><span class="ms-separator">The </span><span class="style10">
				AQUABOX GOLD</span><span class="ms-separator"> humanitarian aid 
				packing list exceeds our basic recommended &quot;Standard Aquabox&quot; 
				packing list. It includes at least 60 items  
				together with a second filter pack to extend it's water 
				purification life for one family of four to well over six 
				months. The Aquabox Gold does not include clothing.</span></p>
