		The Origins of Group Study Exchange<br>
		<br>Norm Winterbottom<br>RGHF History Committee<br><br>In 1950 a group 
		of six young men from Great Britain under Dr Geoff Morton and financed 
		by some Rotary clubs in the County of Yorkshire, travelled to New 
		Zealand. They were billeted and hosted by Rotarians as they travelled 
		through the country.<br><br>In 1955, when New Zealand was divided into 
		only two Districts, Dr Ralph Vernon of the Auckland club, recalling that 
		visit, proposed as a Rotary Jubilee project, the establishment of a 
		Rotary Overseas Travel Award, whereby groups of six young men could 
		travel overseas under the leadership of a Rotarian. While Rotary 
		Foundation Fellowships provided for university graduates, this programme 
		provided for non-graduates. The scheme was enthusiastically embraced by 
		all clubs in the northern District, (No.39) and was financed by 
		donations of $2.00 per member.<br><br>In September, 1956 a team under 
		John Ledgerwood left New Zealand and spent nineteen weeks touring 15 
		Rotary Districts in Great Britain and one member, Mel Cooper of Kaitaia 
		subsequently became District Governor of District 292 in 1981-82. 
		Initially the programme was intended for one year only, but it proved so 
		successful that it was continued annually by District 39. The list of 
		exchanges with the names of the leaders is as follows:-<br><br>1956: To 
		Great Britain - Sept to Dec (John Ledgerwood)<br>1957: To USA Pacific 
		States - August ((Vic Butler)<br>1958-59 From USA Pacific States - (Dr 
		Lyman Partridge)<br>1960 From India - Mar to May -(Janshid Italia)<br>
		1960 To India &amp; Sri Lanka – Nov - (Les Colgan)<br>1962 From India &amp; West 
		Pakistan – Feb to Apr - (Dr Nagori)<br>To Japan via Australia &amp; 
		Indonesia – June to Sep - (Gordon Parker)<br>1963 From Japan – Mar to 
		May - (Tamotau Murayama)<br>1964 To Malaysia &amp; Thailand – Dec ’63 to Feb 
		’64 – (Bert Dreaver)<br><br>In 1959-60 Harold T. Thomas of the Auckland 
		club became RI president and resulting from many favourable comments 
		regarding the value of ROTA, the Board of RI became conscious of the 
		value of the programme. At this time, more funds were becoming available 
		through the Rotary Foundation. Ralph Vernon was invited to visit Chicago 
		and discuss the programme with the result that RI assumed control of the 
		programme through the Rotary Foundation under the name of Group Study 
		Exchange, with the first exchanges taking place in 1965. Because of 
		United States taxation laws, close family members of Rotarians are 
		precluded from participation in GSE<br><br>Also see:<br>“G r o u p S t u

		Group Study Exchange team members visit a nuclear research project near 
		Geneva, circa 1967. From the November 1967 issue of The Rotarian.<br>
		<br>In January 1964, the RI Board of Directors and The Rotary Foundation 
		Board of Trustees approved Group Study Exchange as an official Rotary 
		program. Thirty-four teams from 17 pairs of districts participated in 
		the first round of exchanges during the 1965-66 and 1966-67 Rotary 
		years.<br><br>But young people had been traveling the globe with support 
		from Rotary clubs well before this decision. In 1950, six young men from 
		England went to New Zealand, led by English Rotarian Geoff Morton and 
		financed by clubs in Yorkshire. They traveled the country, staying with 
		Rotarians along the way.<br><br>Rotarian Ralph Vernon proposed a similar 
		endeavor in 1955 to clubs in northern New Zealand, who wanted to 
		commemorate Rotary’s golden anniversary with a district wide effort. 
		District 39 (now districts 9910, 9920, 9930, and 9940) created the 
		Rotary Overseas Travel Award program, and John Ledgerwood, of the Rotary 
		Club of Hamilton, led the first team on a trip to Great Britain.<br><br>
		The program was so successful that district leaders in New Zealand 
		decided to continue it after the anniversary celebrations had ended. 
		Over the next few years, teams from New Zealand traveled to Canada, 
		India, Japan, Sri Lanka, and the United States. New Zealand Rotarians 
		welcomed visitors from these countries as well as from Pakistan.<br><br>
		In the early 1960s, the Trustees began considering programs for 
		non-Rotarians that would promote international goodwill and 
		understanding. One plan was for small groups of young business and 
		professional men to travel from one Rotary district to a district in 
		another country.<br><br>Harold T. Thomas, a New Zealand Rotarian who 
		served as RI president in 1959-60, shared information about the Rotary 
		Overseas Travel Award with the Trustees. Soon after the Board and 
		Trustees approved Group Study Exchange, Vernon and other Rotarians with 
		experience in group exchanges and vocational training were invited to 
		finalize the details of the new Foundation program.<br><br>In the nearly 
		five decades since, more than 70,000 young men and women have traveled 
		the globe as part of Group Study Exchange teams. Posted March 2011 by

		“I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the 
		waters to create many ripples,” is a quote attributed to the famous 
		humanitarian, Mother Teresa. No other statement could so aptly describe 
		the impact that Rotary Group Study Exchange (G.S.E.) experience has had 
		on one’s self, family, friends, and colleagues.<br><br>In fact, the over 
		60 year ‘ripple effect’ of Rotary’s G.S.E. program has resulted in a 
		tidal wave of loving and ongoing friendships, resulting in goodwill, 
		improved world understanding and peace. One does not have to travel far 
		in any community to find examples of someone touched by Rotary through 
		this area of International Service. Many participants have personally 
		grown and developed into industry, community and political leaders.<br>
		<br>My personal introduction to Rotary came in 1977 when a local 
		Rotarian from Galt, Ontario, Robert Lovett, invited me to apply for a 
		G.S.E. As a result of his simple phone call and a successful 
		application, I traveled as a team member to Western Australia, where 
		District 945 (Now 9455) Rotarians helped make the Rotary spark come 
		alive. Little did that member know back then that he was casting a stone 
		across the water to create a ripple effect that would replicate and grow 
		over the next 3O years.<br><br>Few Rotarians are aware that seeds for 
		the original G.S.E. concept were sown as far back as 1950 in Auckland, 
		New Zealand. The idea of an exchange for business and professional 
		people was first born during February and March of that year when 
		Rotarians in the area hosted a group of six young men from Yorkshire 
		(England), led by Dr. Geoff Morton. Eventually this exchange became a 
		pattern for a similar one in 1956, which became a pilot program known as
		<br>ROTA (Rotary Overseas Travel Award).<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" src="GSE&#32;NZ.jpg" style="float: left">One Rotarian who has 
		followed the development and growth of G.S.E. through the years is PDG 
		Ronald Thomas (95/96) of D9920 in Auckland, (With RGHF member PDG Doug 
		Vincent) NZ, who, along with his father and uncles, were involved right 
		from the start. In fact, Ron is the sixth District Governor to come from 
		his family tree and it was a special pleasure to visit him and his wife, 
		Denise at a dinner in their home, tracing the roots of this great 
		program.<br><br>While reviewing the early stages of what would 
		eventually become G.S.E., it was interesting to read the history and 
		hear how, as a young boy, Thomas would overhear the Rotary committee 
		meetings hosted by his father in their home. The ROTA idea was 
		originally put forward in 1955 by Dr. Ralph Vernon as the District (39) 
		project for Rotary’s (50th) Golden Anniversary year.<br><br>The exchange 
		idea was patterned along the lines of the previous one in 1950 and 
		actually took place in September of 1956 when six team members, lead by 
		John Ledgerwood, traveled to Great Britain for a two-month excursion.<br>
		<br>Rotarians liked and supported the program because it brought Rotary 
		into contact with younger groups of people, including the Junior Chamber 
		of Commerce, Young Farmers’ Clubs and Senior Secondary School students. 
		Each member in the district contributed $2. that year to fund the 
		project.<br><br>Following this second successful exchange experience, 
		the District continued with the project over the next few years with the 
		same financial arrangements. Exchanges were made with USA, Canada, 
		India, Ceylon, Malaysia, Thailand Japan and Pakistan. Since then, the 
		district has been involved pioneering special exchanges such as an all 
		female team from the U.S. and the first District to have a G.S.E. with 
		Korea, lead by PDG David Oakley.<br><br>Rotarian John Craig was part of 
		the committee that created ROTA in 1955 and he worked on developing the 
		exchange guidelines and details. He was District Governor in 1959/1960 
		when Harold Thomas, Ron’s uncle, was Rotary International President. 
		Presumably through this connection, word of the successful ROTA project 
		reached the headquarters office and other Rotary districts around the 
		world.<br><br>By 1963 the program was submitted to Rotary Foundation for 
		consideration to conduct worldwide exchanges. It was supported by the 
		Rotary Foundation Trustees and Past R.I. President Harold Thomas from 
		N.Z. Subsequently, Rotarians John Craig and Ralph Vernon, prime 
		architects of the program in Auckland, assisted Evanston staff to design 
		the “Exchanges of Study Groups” program which received final approval 
		from the Foundation Trustees and R.I. Board of Directors in January 
		1964.<br><br>Since then, the name was streamlined to G.S.E. (Group Study 
		Exchange) and the program has had various policy and procedure 
		refinements through the years. One thing that has not changed, however, 
		is the overall purpose of helping improve world understanding through 
		exchange visits of outstanding business professionals to develop good 
		will and peace for the benefit of all mankind. This ripple effect grows 
		and improves the world, one friendship at a time.<br><br>Like those 
		above, many Rotarians have unknowingly cast stones upon the water 
		through the years, causing ripples. And, like many G.S.E. participants, 
		I became a Rotarian and got involved in club activities and district 
		committees. Eventually, several years later, I had more good fortune and 
		participated in a second G.S.E., as Team Leader to the Philippines.<br>
		<br>Little did those few Rotarians know, back in 1950, that many lives 
		would be changed and improved around the world as a result of their 
		activities then. Once again, evidence that one person or one idea, 
		really can make a difference.<br><br>And . . . what about you? Have you 
		cast a stone. . . . or felt the ripple?<br><br>Submitted 23 May 2014 by
