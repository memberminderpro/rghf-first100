				<p>PART 1<br>
				Observations on the RAGs Concept – Post June 2005<br>
				This paper summarizes observations and reports made by 
				interested Rotarians on the Rotary Program: Global Networking 
				Groups including Rotarian Action Groups. <br>
				In 2005, an Ad Hoc Committee chaired by PRIP Jim Lacy 
				recommended the creation of the Rotarian Action Group program 
				under a new umbrella program called Global Networking Groups. 
				The report and recommendation was delivered to the Board by 
				committee member, PRID Ray Klinginsmith. The original concept 
				name from then <b><a href="../../../historians/eberhard.htm">RID 
				John Eberhard</a></b> was: Rotary Registered Service Affiliates 
				(shortened to Rotary Service Affiliates – RSA). The Board 
				approved the concept under the name: Rotarian Action Groups, 
				which was recommended by the Lacy committee. <br>
				The comments in part 2 of this document summarizes in an 
				objective way (both positive and negative observations) comments 
				made in response to the original concept paper which was 
				circulated among approximately 50 Rotarian leaders including 
				senior leaders, staff and Rotarians experienced in Fellowship 
				Groups and International Development (WCS). <br>
				A summery of Rotarian Action Groups can also be found on the 
				History Fellowship web sight at:

				Tin Tin Nu Raschid, Chair 2005-06 (Fellowships Committee year 
				end report)<br>
				<br>
				Dear Fellow Rotarians, <br>
				<br>
				It has been a great honor for me to have been appointed to Chair 
				the RI Committee on the Global Networking Groups by President 
				Carl-Wilhelm Stenhammer. I am the first woman to Chair this 
				Committee, and the last chair of the Global Networking Groups. 
				From July 1, 2006, there will be two separate Chairs. Abe Gordon 
				will Chair the Fellowships and Brian Knowles will Chair the 
				Rotarian Action Groups.<br>
				<br>
				During the year my committee recommended, and the RI Board 
				approved, four Global Networking Groups , namely, Rotarians 
				Eliminating Malaria, International Fellowship of Shooting 
				Rotarians, Rotarians for Advancement of Latin Culture and 
				International Fellowship of Marathon Running Rotarians. There 
				are a couple of Groups that will be considered at the next Board 
				meeting. Three Fellowships, namely, Rotarian Amateur 
				Astronomers, Arts &amp; Communication and Ballroom Dancing have 
				disbanded, bringing the total to 95, as of May, 2006.<br>
				<br>
				Also as of May 2006, 86 Global Networking Groups have been 
				categorized as Rotary Fellowships, and the following nine groups 
				are categorized as Rotary Action Groups:<br>
				<br>
				1. Rotarians for Fighting AIDS<br>
				2. Rotarian Action Group of Dental Volunteers<br>
				3. Rotarians for Hearing Regeneration<br>
				4. Humanitarian Service Rotary Action Group<br>
				5. Rotarians Eliminating Malaria<br>
				6. Rotarians for Mine action<br>
				7. Rotarian Action Group for Multiple Sclerosis<br>
				8. Rotarian Action Group for Population and Development<br>
				9. Rotarian Action Group for polio Survivors and Associates.<br>
				<br>
				President Elect Bill Boyd has appointed a Committee for the 
				Rotarian Action Groups for 2006-07. This committee will be 
				called upon to study all pending Rotary Action Group proposals 
				and share findings with the Board in November, at which time 
				they will be considered for official recognition. The committee 
				will also make recommendations to the Board concerning policies 
				for these groups in order to better the good work that they do 
				on behalf of Rotary.<br>
				<br>
				A total of 32 Global Networking Groups participated at the 
				Convention in Copenhagen and Malmo. My grateful thanks go to all 
				the Rotarians who took time to come out and attend the booths 
				and inform the Rotarians of their activities. Special thanks 
				goes to Phyllis Nusz for preparing the Posters for the General 
				Booth, which was manned by Marc Crotts, Ed &amp; Lois Goering, 
				Ursula Grattapaglia, Mike Jackson, Mike Lakin, Robin &amp; Susan 
				Shelly, Dick &amp; Cay Roberts, Vinnie &amp; Radha Kudva and Bilal 
				Raschid.<br>
				<br>
				We have been going through a lot of changes in the past couple 
				of years, and yet all of us are doing what we have always done 
				for our Fellowships, and for the good of humanity. Whatever RI's 
				decisions may be, we stand very strong on our own, and I am sure 
				all of us will continue to keep our Fellowships progressing in 
				every way.<br>
				<br>
				My very special thanks to Jesse Allerton, Senior Co-ordinator, 
				Service Support &amp; Awards Department of RI who was a great 
				support throughout the year.<br>
				<br>
				Sincerely,<br>
				<br>

				Hello Bill,<br>
				<br>
				Yes, indeed, very good question, Bill - a question that should 
				have been addressed, in my opinion, at this early stage of the 
				implementation of the Rotarian Action Groups program. One of the 
				difficulties that some have had with the RAGs concept is the 
				role that is expected to be played by them. How does it differ 
				from the role of Clubs and the role of International Committees 
				and Resource Groups. How can they assist the Clubs to better 
				perform certain community service projects? What is the criteria 
				used to determine whether or not an applicant should receive 
				recognition? Unfortunately, this aspect of the Board's policy 
				was not sufficiently thrashed out! <br>
				<br>
				As you point out, the &quot;official&quot; Resource Groups are every bit 
				as &quot;official&quot; as the Board approved Rotarian Action Groups. This 
				information on the Resource Groups is readily available to all 
				Rotarians who read the O/D. The extent to which Rotarians make 
				use of it is a different matter. The mandates are quite 
				different and at the moment there is really no connection 
				between the two. There should be, in my opinion! <br>
				<br>
				Recognition of a Rotarian Action Group requires a very careful 
				policy and administrative framework. The Board, in June 2005 
				went a long way in articulation this. Some issues were 
				overlooked. Because I brought this program proposal to the Board 
				in the first place, I continued to provide input. Last August, I 
				made the suggestion to President Carl-Wilhelm and the G/S (based 
				on the materials we developed in Committee) as to how this 
				recognition process might unfold. Certainly, my Board 
				Administration Committee focused on this before making the 
				recommendation to the Programs Committee and to the Board. We 
				reviewed, in detail, the way in which this distinction between 
				the Concern for Health (now the Water, Health and Hunger 
				Concerns Resource Group) was mandated and how the RAGs would be 
				structured. Obviously, the Board was satisfied with it. But now, 
				it does not seem so clear!<br>
				<br>
				Your question is good also because it begs the distinction 
				between what RI is expected to do (i.e., in the language of the 
				Resource Group mandate: &quot;This resource group will work to 
				increase awareness ---provide information -----etc.&quot;) and what 
				is expected to be done by the clubs. A Rotarian Action Group 
				would not be expected to duplicate the mandate of a Resource 
				Group although it may well have similar capacity in certain very 
				focused ways (i.e developing operational protocols for a health 
				Fair, as compared to informing Clubs that a Health Fair is a 
				possible way of doing a local health Community project). An 
				Action group is required by its policy framework to work through 
				the clubs and districts - the Rotary network. Yes, an Action 
				Group may very well make use of information that comes from the 
				Resource Group but of more interest, subject to the criteria 
				used to recognize them, they would have a much higher level of 
				applied expertise and focus then what we have seen in Resource 
				Groups (unfortunately). Primarily, this is because of the very 
				restricted mandate and/or a lack of detailed &quot;job descriptions&quot; 
				provided to Resource Groups. Witness, the grief that was 
				provided the World Community Service Committee last year just 
				because it wanted to &quot;do something&quot; - i.e. host a meeting! 
				Perhaps it is this latter point that has prompted so many 
				Rotarians to create the many proliferating &quot;cause related&quot; 
				Rotarian based entities. <br>

				Ultimately, if harnessed in a discerning way, they will be very 
				beneficial to the service delivery capacity of Rotary and its 
				public image. This, again in my opinion, is something that 
				Resource groups are not mandated to be or to do. But like you, I 
				am concerned that the policy framework is not yet complete. I 
				strongly believe that a clear distinction between the mandate of 
				both RAGs and RI Committees have to be worked out. To a large 
				extent, this boils down to the question: By what criteria will 
				an Action Group be recognized by the Board? I did a lengthy 
				paper on this but the staff did not act on it. This is 
				regrettable now because without such a policy in place, there 
				are questions such as the one you have raised that have no forum 
				in which an answer can be formalized. It would be my hope that 
				the Board will consider this very question at some time in the 
				near future.<br>
				<br>
				Thank you Bill, for taking the time to keep abreast of this 
				challenging question and entering into the discussion.<br>

				Dear John,<br>
				<br>
				Thanks for your various communications in relation to the matter 
				of the Rotary Action Groups. I am aware that there is divided 
				opinion on this issue among Rotary leaders, past and present, 
				and it will be the task of my committee to sort through these 
				and formulate a policy that will be <br>
				beneficial to our organisation. I am well aware of the 
				importance of this task, and it is borne out by the amount of 
				communication that has been received since the committee was 
				first appointed. Indeed, in all of the years I have served on 
				various RI committees/task forces etc, I have never <br>
				accumulated such a large file before the committee has even met. 
				I just hope we can sift through the information overload and 
				find the best answer.<br>
				<br>
				I realise that it is going to be almost impossible for us to 
				come up with a solution that makes every Rotarian happy - I just 
				hope our solutions satisfy the vast majority.<br>

				Good Thinking…………..RAGS with guidelines will give new needed 
				momentum to Rotary International. It was a long time coming but 
				finally our Board saw the benefits. It is only logical that a 
				group of dedicated Rotarians from 20 countries, etc. be able to 
				promote what any local small Rotary Club is doing today.<br>
				-----------------------------<br>
				<br>
				I have to agree with John. I believe that Bill will also come up 
				with ways to use John’s passion in feeling that these Rotary 
				Action Groups are a Win- Win for Rotary. I see it as a Rotary 
				changing with the times to continue to be relevant. I see it as 
				a way to stay ahead of the times. We will come up with the 
				necessary guidelines.<br>
				------------------------ <br>
				<br>
				Hope all see the good work you want to do by bringing together 
				those persons who have a passion to promote the value of these 
				Health Fairs. Good that persons who acquire the expertise will 
				come together whether it be in a Fellowship and even better if 
				you get a group of Proactive Rotarians who actually want to be 
				an Action Group. It is encouraging to see that the actual Health 
				Fairs are organized by the local clubs. This is the traditional 
				ways in which community service projects are undertaken and 
				therefore not anything unusual! Except - the overall RAGs 
				guidelines and professional guidance is provided by those who 
				have developed a standard protocol for these events! Were it not 
				for the encouragement and the consistent professional standards 
				developed by this &quot;Action Group&quot;, the results would have been 
				much different. Perhaps the clubs would never have undertaken 
				the organizational task in the first place. <br>
				<br>
				------------------------- <br>
				<br>
				Good that we are having good discussions as noted in below email 
				from John Eberhard. I see Rotary changing with the times to not 
				only keep up with the times but even to be Ahead Of The Times. 
				RAGS &amp; Fellowships are going to be the reason persons stay in 
				Rotary in this our second century.<br>
				<br>
				-------------------------- <br>
				<br>
				So many details to look into regarding Fellowships and Rotary 
				Action Groups but at the end of the day we will come up with the 
				necessary guidelines. I personally feel that these groups will 
				be the reason that Rotary remains relevant or more relevant in 
				our second century. We will be channeling Rotarians into Special 
				Interest Groups in Fellowships or Rotary Action Groups where 
				persons interested come together.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Dear Family of Rotary: <br>
				As one of Rotary's Key Leaders allow me to share my personal 
				thoughts where I try to Create Awareness for you and others to 
				Take Action regarding fellowships &amp; Rotary Action Groups. <br>
				When I see members of The Family of Rotary with a Special 
				Interest which might be a hobby, recreational activity, 
				vocation, humanitarian, educational, health related or country 
				focused issue, I look for ways that they might come together, at 
				same time enhance Rotary &amp; help keep them interested &amp; involved 
				in Rotary. One of those ways that is more meaningful and with 
				some degree of continuity &amp; applicable to Rotary is via Our 
				Existing &amp; Ever Growing Fellowships &amp; our New Rotary Action 
				Groups. <br>
				I have a personal goal of helping Rotarians that have or live 
				with someone who has one of life’s many health related issues 
				coming together in Rotary Fellowships &amp; Rotary Action Groups to 
				explore how they might benefit, support, help one another, 
				create awareness, take action, etc. to help themselves and 
				others. Good to see that we now have Approved Fellowships where 
				Rotarians with Repaired Hearts, M.S. &amp; Hearing Loss can come 
				together if they wish as well as those who have a “Special 
				Interest” in that particular health issue. <br>
				I also want to help Rotarians who have so many reputable 
				&quot;Special Interests&quot; that are now or in thre process of becoming 
				Rotary Action Groups involving landmines, population, food &amp; 
				hunger, literacy, water, Eyecare, etc. We have to find new ways 
				of channeling Rotarians with those reputable “Special Interests” 
				into Fellowships or Rotary Action Groups. If we don’t 
				proactively promote these Fellowships &amp; Rotary Action Groups we 
				will continue to lose members in the same way other 
				organizations, groups and churches have lost members. <br>
				I’m glad that we have Fellowships like that of Rotary 
				International Convention Goers that is made up of Rotarians who 
				not only like going to our Conventions year after year but they 
				also want to promote Convention Attendance as a unique way to 
				learn of the internationality of Rotary. <br>
				Because we are so proud of mentioning our involvement with the 
				birth of the United Nations, I’d like to see a Rotary Friends of 
				the U.N. Fellowship of those Rotarians who like sharing 
				information about the work of that organization. Being 
				innovative I can see the benefit of other fellowships which 
				could be Rotarians who have a “special interest” involving the 
				World Bank, International Development Bank, Boy &amp; Girl Scouts, 
				etc., etc. The basic idea is to allow those Rotarians with any 
				respectable &quot;Special Interests&quot; in Our Family of Rotary to come 
				together via a Fellowship or a Rotary Action Group where they 
				would communicate among one another via Internet &amp; and find ways 
				of getting together at our Conventions, etc. <br>
				I recently found a group of Rotarians who have as their &quot;special 
				interest&quot; to be involved in helping Mongolia and others who feel 
				the same about helping Cambodia . The idea that came to mind 
				was……………………………… Why not fellowships of Rotary Friends of 
				Mongolia , Rotary Friends of Cambodia or Rotarian Friends of Any 
				Particular Country?? (Rotarian Friends of Ethiopia ) Let’s face 
				it, there are Rotarians who have an interest in helping certain 
				areas of the world and others who could care less. Hope you see 
				the idea or concept of bringing together and allowing Rotarians 
				with a desire to help a certain country to know one another if 
				that is their desire in a ongoing organized manner. I can not 
				for the life of me understand why we have not thought of 
				something similar in the past. <br>
				What ever the Fellowship, Recreational, Vocational, Educational, 
				Health Related, Country Focused or whatever respectable &quot;Special 
				Interest Group&quot; we would always keep highly in mind that Rotary 
				is a highly respected international organization &amp; for that 
				reason whatever we do has to take into account the importance of 
				respecting ethnic, cultural &amp; religious sensitivities found in 
				Our Rotary World. <br>
				Existing Rotary Fellowships from Repaired Hearts, Eyecare , MS , 
				Polio Survivors Fellowships are examples for The Family of 
				Rotary to consider the forming others dealing with Diabetes, 
				Cancer Survivors, Hepatitis C, etc. <br>
				The existing Population and HIV related fellowships is another 
				example of Rotarians with that Special Interest coming together 
				and after being a Fellowship are now a Rotary Action Groups. 
				There are distinct differences regarding the guidelines for 
				Fellowships which are different to Rotary Action Groups and all 
				should learn those differences. <br>
				Promoting the above is a Rotary coming into its second century 
				by having adapted to Changing Times. Not accepting changes of 
				the type I am mentioning in my personal opinion simply will make 
				us go the route of other similar type organizations that like 
				certain businesses have now been long forgotten. <br>
				I hope you get my message of trying to help Rotary in finding a 
				variety of innovative ways to keep Rotarians interested in 
				staying in Rotary. You can help Rotary at all levels to see the 
				benefits of promoting the concept of Fellowships, Rotary Action 
				Groups and whatever we might call now or in the future these 
				well meaning Rotarians who would like to have their respectable 
				&quot;Special Interest Group&quot; coming together. <br>

				I really do not see the problem in Fund Raising as every Rotary 
				Club and District have always carried out independently of the 
				R.I. Board or Trustees of The Rotary Foundation.<br>
				<br>
				It is hard for me to grasp why A RAG would be much different. We 
				never have limited a Club to ask permission to get funds for 
				their projects. Why make it more difficult for RAGS?<br>
				<br>
				Can you imagine telling all the Rotary Clubs &amp; Districts of the 
				world that they have to limit their Fundraising for their 
				Special Interest Projects??? We would have a Revolution!!<br>
				<br>
				Of Course we should set up some guidelines but I hope we would 
				never Stop them from using their initiative which is the basic 
				reason of Rotary's success in all of our history. I can see 
				Rotary Clubs saying &quot;Goodbye Rotary....We are starting Our Own 
				Organization that does not hold us back&quot;.<br>
				<br>
				My conclusion we need the enthusiasm that might come from 
				different RAGS that will help us carry out projects which will 
				have more of an impact.<br>

				<br>
				Dear Frank<br>
				<br>
				Thank you for including me in this Frank. I think Rotary is on 
				the right track here as well. The Rotarian Action Groups will 
				open up a whole new vista of service opportunities - undertaken 
				in a more congruent way and in support of our strategic plan 
				which invites RI to &quot;sharpen it program focus&quot;. Really, as was 
				suggested to the June Board meeting that created the Global 
				Networking Groups Program entity, this additional means of 
				undertaking World Community Service can indeed work 
				collaboratively with TRF and RI through the club and district 
				network - realizing that individual clubs do not have the 
				capacity to do what an &quot;action group&quot; can do (witness - 
				PolioPlus!). At the same time, a RAG can be tremendously 
				supportive of what our clubs do and in creating expert protocols 
				for undertaking our traditional projects. There need be no 
				threat to clubs in this new paradigm of service delivery.<br>
				<br>
				But the devil is in the detail and as you suggest, a clear 
				policy framework is necessary to ensure &quot;excellence&quot; in the 
				development of a Rotarian Action Group. This includes a clear 
				working relationship with TRF, international committees (task 
				forces and resource groups) and the Clubs. The Board has taken a 
				bold step to advance this program but the recognition issues 
				were not thoroughly debated and I applaud the recent decision to 
				step back and ensure that the single Rotarian Action Group 
				approved in a particular sector has the capacity, the expertise, 
				the internationality and a mandate supported by RI to perform 
				with the efficacy that will raise the public image of Rotary and 
				make Rotarians proud to be associated with the activity - the 
				very way in which Rotarians feel proud of being associated with 
				the Polio Plus program. <br>
				<br>
				As I suggested in a letter to RIP Carl-Wilhelm and G/S Ed last 
				August, I feel strongly that the application process and 
				recognition criteria have to receive attention and widespread 
				approval. Some very comprehensive recommendations were made at 
				that time. In this respect, there was also some excellence 
				guidance provided to the Administration and the Program 
				Committees of the Board last year before the Board agreed to 
				move forward with the GNG program. It would be very useful for 
				those now considering the criteria for recognition of a RAG to 
				review this background and perhaps have input from those 
				involved. Given your outspoken support of this initiative, 
				perhaps you can lend your influence to ensure that this happens. 
				I am confident that it would be helpful. <br>
				<br>
				Thank you for the way in which you &quot;create awareness&quot; and invite 
				others to take action! A Rotarian Action Group, unlike an 
				International Committee in WCS, can do just that! I wonder if 
				there is any connection? <br>
				<br>
				Best regards,<br>
				<br>

				<br>
				RI, through Board decision to adopt Policy 40.010, has defined 
				the relationship between RI and RAG. Bill Boyd expresses a 
				deeper question than the apparent: that being, is it the role of 
				the Board to centralize and control Rotary activities, or can 
				the Board allow entrepreneurial activity centers that operate 
				with realtive independence? Boards by nature see themselves as 
				control agencies. Within the confines of the RI Constitutional 
				documents, the Board has the authority to set and change 
				operational policy. Boards are naturally and rightfully 
				apprehensive of the sub-groups within its ranks that are not 
				governed so as to act in predictable ways. The other side of 
				this coin is that groups who see themselves as self-governed, or 
				autonomous, are more like to exercise creativity and ingenuity 
				in pursuing their objectives that would otherwise not be 
				available or instinctive. This is a question of management style 
				that perplexes businesses . The answer may come from another 
				question: how do you motivate superior performance? Progressive 
				management trends are toward defining the broader goals (as in 
				humanitarian service), and then providing reasonable freedom to 
				allow the actors to achieve those goals. Rather than saying, “Go 
				from point A to point G, and here is the path to take”, the more 
				progressive method says “Go from point A to point G, good luck”. 
				With regard to Fellowships, Initiatives, RAG over the past ten 
				years, the Board has been ambivalent on this question, issuing 
				new governing policies every three years or so. These policy 
				changes emanate from a change of leadership, who see the Board’s 
				role in a different way than the predecessors. This ambivalence 
				and tendency to change its policy every few years is probably to 
				be expected, but it is also imposes chaos on the sub-groups, not 
				just from an organizational point of view, but from a legal 
				point of view. It distracts from their effectiveness and 
				credibility. It would be very nice for the Board to adopt a 
				position, and then keep it. But since this apparently can not 
				be, maybe the RI Council on Legislation needs to address the 
				question, possibly by adopting a RAG policy that is not subject 
				to the changing personalities of the Board. <br>
				<br>
				1. What are RAG relationship to outside Partners? <br>
				Current policy is confusing on this account. The referenced 
				policy items infer that if RAG are operating within the confines 
				of RI Policy (which is an enormously large area of confinement, 
				but whose boundaries are finally defined by the Board), then the 
				RAG are free to go about their business in ways they see best 
				fit. But some people state that RAGs do not promote other 
				organizations. It is possible to have a third-party partner in a 
				project, without promoting that other organization. But 
				suspicious observes can always cry foul – saying that by working 
				together, the RAG is promoting the other organization. The 
				reality is that the trend among all service agencies is toward 
				partnering and collaboration. Rotary does it. In order to be 
				effective, all organizations should do it. RAG Population and 
				RAG AIDS do it. So how does RI sit with this reality? The 
				relationship defined in the 40.010 policy seems to address the 
				concern directly: act within the policies of RI, keep us advised 
				of what you are doing and go about your work. If you act outside 
				the RI Policy, the RI Board may terminate the RAG .<br>
				<br>
				2. What are RAG relationship to clubs and districts? <br>
				<br>
				RAG does its work and observes the rules of the Code If the 
				Board feels the need for more constraint on the RAG with regard 
				to the clubs and districts, what might it be?<br>
				<br>
				3. What is relation of RAG projects to RI Task Forces, Resource 
				Groups, WCS? <br>
				<br>
				Because certain action topics are very popular among many 
				Rotarians, the voice of RAG has become audible, and even loud 
				sometimes. It may be bothersome to RI leadership to listen to 
				these voices, but alternatively, the RAG voice can be considered 
				a grass-roots voice, most valid in the sense that it is a voice 
				of a large contingency of members of the organization. Good 
				leadership illuminates direction that the masses may not see as 
				apparent, but as the work toward the goals is accomplished, its 
				validity is proven. But there is also an imperative for good 
				leadership to listen to the voice of those they lead; to ignore 
				that voice could be to miss a key initiative, or even for the 
				leader to find himself without a following. The President and 
				his Board will usually set project and program emphasis, and 
				because of his command of the RI organizational structure and 
				the RI media, the president’s priorities will always be 
				dominant, and command real corporate attention. No RAG can 
				change that. The president appoints the Task Forces and the 
				Resource Groups, so they will be loyal to his charge to them. 
				Concerning whether RAG will influence WCS direction, if RAG are 
				at all effective, they will assert influence. By policy, they 
				are charged to do so. But since only clubs and districts carry 
				out WCS projects, there will always be the following limit on 
				RAG projects. If the clubs or districts are not interested in 
				the projects, they will not do them. It seems leadership would 
				encourage as many voice sources from within its ranks, to have 
				the best chance or correctly reading the desires and wishes of 
				the group. <br>
				<br>
				4. Cost to RI of administering RAG? <br>
				<br>
				This question is answered in the referenced policy paragraphs. 
				RI Code states that it has no financial duty to RAG. RI also 
				agrees to provide RI Directory space and meeting space at the RI 
				Convention (when available), but could easily withdraw those 
				allowances if they were cumbersome. In that RI has established 
				RAG by policy, if it chooses to administer the RAG policy, it 
				must carry out its own prescribed duties within that policy. So 
				RI apparently has already agreed to accept this administrative 
				expense. From this view over the past years, that administrative 
				expense has been minimal. If RI has information to the contrary, 
				please share.<br>
				<br>
				5. Do RAG divert revenue to TRF from Rotarians, Partners, or TRF 
				fund distribution through Matching Grants or DDF? <br>
				<br>
				Our opinion is that RAG increase revenue to TRF, not divert 
				revenue. With only minor exceptions, RAG project money flows to 
				TRF, usually in the form of restricted contributions toward 
				Matching Grants. In the ten years that RAG Population has 
				existed, we recall 20 to 25 Rotarian donations to RAG 
				Population, one $10,000, a few $5,000, some $1,000 and others 
				smaller. These donations all came to RAG Population because the 
				donors believed in the specific mission of the RAG. No one can 
				say, but we think that those funds would have never made it in 
				an unrestricted manner to TRF, since TRF does not emphasize the 
				area of work. The private foundation grants that RAG Population 
				has been given in the past can be regarded in a similar way: 
				they have come from organizations who target this RAG’s area of 
				work, and they see the grant to us as a way of furthering their 
				own objectives. The same grants would have never been given to 
				RI or TRF, since neither embrace the specific work topics of the 
				RAG. So in fact, the ability of RAG to offer specific work 
				topics as a source for both private and foundation grants is a 
				method whereby the restricted funds of TRF are increased, and 
				made more effective in the furtherance of the Objective of the 
				Foundation.<br>

				Dear Rotarian Action Group Leaders:<br>
				<br>
				I wish to commend PRID John Eberhard whose vision led to the 
				carving out of the Rotarian Action Groups. After history proved 
				the world was roundthere were no shortage of explorers...not so 
				when it was flat!The Action Groups, in my mind have unlimited 
				opportunities. There is afear I think that somehow Rotary and 
				its Foundation will be lost in all<br>
				of this, but I only see the great potential of Rotarians working 
				together for a common purpose through service. Action groups 
				will undoubtedly develop future key resource people that can 
				help all clubs and districts give more &quot;specialized&quot; service, 
				and those of us who serve at the RI level should be quick to 
				embrace that concept.<br>
				<br>
				While I serve on the Board of Directors for 2007-2009, it would 
				be my wish to continue to champion John's vision of Rotarian 
				Action Groups, as well as yours for the good of Rotary.<br>
				<br>
				Thank you for what you do for Rotary,<br>
				Monty Audenart<br>
				Founder, Rotarian Action Group of Dental Volunteers<br>
				Director 2007-2009<br>
				<br>
				PDG Richard Clarke<br>
				The Rotary Foundation should consider extending eligibility to 
				utilize 3 H – <br>
				Grants to the new Rotary Action Groups. <br>
				The new Rotary Action Groups program is an important development 
				in Rotary’s toolboxof humanitarian agents. This initiative is in 
				response to the organic growth of service- related Fellowships 
				that have brought together interested Rotarians from around the 
				globe who want to unite to take action and address international 
				humanitarian concerns. These service-related organizations have 
				become part of international networks of other NGO’s <br>
				who share their concerns and determination. They have access to 
				expert partners, well developed and managed action programs and 
				in some cases access to additional funds from NGO’s and state 
				aid agencies. <br>
				<br>
				Within the emerging Rotary Action Groups themselves, there is 
				the internationality of Rotary and the potential to encourage 
				Rotary Clubs to support their initiatives. As they grow in 
				number and strength, they will increasingly have the ability to 
				design, develop and implement significant international 
				projects. The Foundation could through these Rotary Action 
				Groups, leverage Foundation Funds by taking advantage of 
				financial support from others to enable Rotary to undertake 
				significant well planned and executed humanitarian projects. <br>
				<br>
				One current example of this, are the Canadian Rotary Clubs who 
				have been able to take advantage of funding from Canada’s 
				International Development Agency to increase the leverage of 
				club and Foundation funds. <br>
				<br>
				It is important that the Rotary Action Groups not supplant 
				Rotary Clubs as the principle sponsors of international 
				projects. So while they have the capacity to act as a catalyst 
				and an organizer of larger projects and as noted above, can 
				access important expertise and funds from others, there should 
				remain a strong link to Rotary Clubs. To maintain that important 
				principle, Rotary Action Group access to 3H Grants could be made 
				dependent <br>
				upon Rotary Club support for the proposed project. Given the 
				required internationality of the Rotary Action Groups, 3 H 
				Grants eligibility could require something like the financial 
				participation of 10 clubs from at least 3 countries. <br>
				<br>
				Rotary Volunteers: <br>
				<br>
				• The Rotary Foundation should consider creating a new program 
				or perhaps work with Rotary International to broaden the current 
				Rotary Volunteers program to help low income countries build the 
				skills and value system necessary to escape the poverty trap.
				<br>
				<br>
				The current RV program focuses on rather narrow band of specific 
				professional expertise that can be used to help implement either 
				community or international projects in host countries. While 
				there is nothing wrong with the program as it is, there is an 
				additional need for expertise in many low-income countries. <br>
				<br>
				For low-income countries to escape their poverty trap, they need 
				to develop entrepreneur ship, ensure better governance of 
				private companies and public services and build or rebuild their 
				infrastructure. With an organization of 1.2 million members 
				drawn from entrepreneurs and professionals, Rotarians could play 
				an important role in assisting a wide variety of organizations 
				working in low-income countries to help them tackle these 
				foundational aspects of a successful society. <br>

				<br>
				Dear John<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Thank you for doing your best &quot; to ensure that Rotary and the 
				world<br>
				will be well served by these&quot; RAGs. For you to see the first 
				successful results of more and better <br>
				Service above self made possible by the RAGs will be the best 
				compensation for your so valuable great input.<br>
				<br>
				Rotary has been able to achieve so very much for humankind with 
				PolioPlus, that, at comparably no expense to RI, Rotary has the 
				potential to very easily do so very much more for humankind 
				where the need is greatest and Rotarians are best at, and should 
				thus not wait any longer to reach its full potential and use 
				much better its global organization and all the willing and so 
				very well-prepared Rotarians everywhere to proactively support 
				best possible sustainable development and the Millennium Goals !<br>
				<br>
				Besides RI urgently undertaking soonest to very greatly 
				strengthen its organization and its team doing an always better 
				job in representing RI at the United Nations and so really 
				making optimal use of all the opportunities offered to RI as an 
				NGO (the best and strongest), it will be especially the Rotarian 
				Action Groups that will be ideal to achieve this in the field, 
				everywhere where the need is greatest !<br>
				<br>
				The Environment Fellowship of Rotarians would thus henceforth 
				proactively encourage the formation of RAGs in the fields of 
				Water, Health, Alternative Energies, Pollution, and so many 
				other areas conducive to a better environment and quality of 
				life for all.<br>
				<br>
				As you point out so well &quot;it defines and tests the dedication, 
				integrity, capacity, credibility and professionalism of those 
				wishing to achieve recognition as a Rotary Action Group. The 
				successful ones will indeed sharpen Rotarys program focus&quot;<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Looking forward to keep in contact on these so vital matters, 
				I'm very gratefully yours in Rotary service,<br>

				Dear Amigo Frank, <br>
				<br>
				Your welcome message regarding our Fellowships in Rotary is most 
				welcome, appropriate and timely. Indeed we need to to 
				continually proactively Create Awareness for all to take Action 
				helping Rotary move forward in this our second century and 
				always better fulfill the Object of Rotary !<br>
				<br>
				Rotary International has offered us the unique opportunity to 
				consider transforming our Fellowships into Rotarian Action 
				Groups (RAGs), and I'm happy to share with you the good news 
				that the Environment Fellowship of Rotarians is proactively 
				encouraging Rotarians of similar environmental interests to 
				unite in several such RAGs. We very much look forward to be in 
				contact on this matter and to soon meet RAGs' and Fellowships' 
				representatives at the RI Convention in Copenhagen.<br>
				<br>
				Among the Rotarian Action Groups which the Environment 
				Fellowship of Rotarians is now promoting are also RAGs the 
				fields of :<br>
				<br>
				- Alternative Energies - Energias limpias<br>
				- Water Resources / Sanitation - Agua potable y segura para 
				consumo<br>
				- Waste Treatment / Recycling - Disposición final de los 
				residuos solidos<br>
				- Forestry / Deforestation - Plantación de arboles<br>
				- Pollution Control - Control de la polución<br>
				- Environmental Education / Consulting - Educación ambiental<br>
				- Health / Nutrition - Salud / Nutrición<br>
				_ Agriculture / Food - Agricoltura / Generos alimentares<br>
				- National Parks - Parcos Nacionales<br>
				- Industry / Pulp-Paper - Industria / Producción de papel<br>
				- Organic Gardening / Composting - Agricultura organica<br>
				<br>
				which are here listed also in Spanish, which I learned in your 
				Mexico, Frank.<br>
				<br>
				I do thus hereby invite all of you officials of Rotary 
				Fellowships to please mention to your memberships that all 
				Rotarians, their spouses and Rotaractors who have an interest in 
				the environment in general and in any of the above subjects 
				should please visit our Environment Fellowship of Rotarians 
				website <br>
				Gracias Amigo Frank.<br>
				Long live the Rotary Fellowships and the Rotarian Action Groups 
				!!!<br>
				<br>
				Your amigo in the Pacific,<br>

				Bill Cadwallader, PRID<br>
				<br>
				The assets that I believe Rotary International enjoys as a 
				result of encouraging Rotary Action Groups (RAGS):<br>
				<br>
				1. Involved Rotarians are extremely dedicated to Rotary and 
				committed to developing projects between Rotary Clubs of the 
				world within the policy framework of Rotary International (RI) 
				and The Rotary Foundation (TRF).<br>
				<br>
				2. By facilitating international projects between Rotary clubs 
				of the world RAGS members stimulate a higher level of giving to 
				TRF by raising awareness of the work of TRF in clubs.<br>
				<br>
				3. Like Rotarians who dedicate their lives to the work of Youth 
				Exchange or Interact feel Rotary’s strong commitment to youth, 
				Rotarians who concentrate their efforts to individual RAGS are 
				committed to utilizing Rotary’s networking capabilities for 
				concerns such as population and development, reducing the 
				transmission of HIV/AIDS, massive movements of used medical 
				equipment and school books via world community service contacts 
				and reducing infection from malaria. These activities not only 
				make Rotarians feel pride in their organization, these 
				activities bring respect for our Rotary goals of bringing hope 
				to every world citizen.<br>
				<br>
				4. No matter the amount of giving to TRF, Our Foundation cannot 
				possibly do all the work needed to bring peace through better 
				understanding. Foundation funds should be used to stimulate 
				Rotarians to develop projects, first as a pilot effort using 
				Matching Grant Funds, then as a 3-H Grant to prove the work can 
				be done on a larger scale, and then have the Rotarians seek 
				funds from other sources. This has been done first with 
				Polio-plus, with child-spacing in Nigeria and efforts with AIDS. 
				TRF funds should ideally be used as seed monies for gaining 
				assistance from other cooperating agencies. Monies coming from 
				cooperating agencies should be able to be placed within a Donor 
				Advised Fund for use by the RAG when projects and needs become 
				available.<br>
				<br>
				5. RI Presidents cannot possibly appoint all of the Rotarians 
				interested in doing the work of Rotary to presidential 
				committees. Rotarians appointed to one year term committees for 
				long term problems seldom are able to accomplish more than 
				report on work already being done by others previously as it is 
				hard to initiate, and then complete, projects internationally 
				within one year. RAGS Rotarians work together for the long 
				commitment of 10-20 years allowing development projects that 
				provide continuity and long term sustainability.<br>
				<br>
				Like most things in Rotary, it takes time for the evolution of 
				new ideas to be accepted. You must have been a Rotarian long 
				enough to remember the strong differences of opinion that were 
				present when Clem Renolf proposed 3-H Grants. It was a difficult 
				time for that wonderful Past RI President, yet it passed and 
				became the tool used to develop Polio-plus and so many other 
				great Rotary programs. Few visionaries seem to be in harmony 
				with their peers at the outset of their goals.<br>

				<br>
				I would like to see the Rotarian Action Groups Committee produce 
				a proposal that takes into account the reasonable concerns by 
				Rotary International and at the same time protects the 
				entrepreneurial advantages of the RAGs. I agree that it is 
				important to protect Rotary International from harm and to make 
				sure that Rotary remains a strong unified organization. <br>
				<br>
				I also believe it will be necessary for Rotary to be more 
				decentralized for future growth, which will also attract younger 
				members to Rotary. The rest of society is moving in this 
				direction. History teaches us about the futility of preserving 
				old orders, whose time have come to pass. <br>
				<br>
				Rotary International is an important organization. Without 
				Rotary International, Rotary would not be the international 
				service organization is today. I believe that the Rotary actions 
				take place at the club level. Rotary International's role is to 
				facilitate and support the districts and the clubs in their 
				Rotary Service. <br>
				<br>
				It would not be good for Rotary International to become a 
				bureaucracy that stifles incentives at the grass root level. 
				Rotarians are responsible and compassionate leaders in society 
				with a commitment to service. RI President Bill Boyd recognizes 
				this in his theme &quot;Lead The Way&quot;. I think that the RAGs need to 
				be designed so that Rotarians can provide their service through 
				Rotary with maximum efficiency. <br>
				<br>
				I believe the future success of Rotary depends on how successful 
				the Rotarian Action Groups Committee is with the design of its 
				proposal. <br>

				<br>
				Hi John,<br>
				I have read with a great interest your e-mail sent yesterday 
				about RAG.<br>
				First let me congratulate you for having been the leader in that 
				=<br>
				project.<br>
				<br>
				Having that accepted by the board in such a short period of time 
				is<br>
				wonderful. I remember last November when you did submitted your 
				proposal =<br>
				to the board. At that time I thought that is was the beginning 
				of a long<br>
				process to have that change. But I am glad today to see that you 
				have<br>
				succeeded and this in a short period of time! In my very humble 
				opinion, this new format of Fellowships and Action Groups will 
				clarify the exact role of each groups. Needless to tell you that 
				actually the fellowships and action groups are all mixed up 
				toghether. This bring confusion and the new &quot;appellation 
				control=E9e&quot; will put a end to that.<br>
				<br>
				For many Rotarians, Fellowship, that's what Rotary is all about. 
				For Some others it is a mix of Fellowship and WCS. For me it is 
				clearly WCS which<br>
				appeal me the most. Now I know that an Action Group is solely 
				dedicated to WCS. It is now clear and no confusion will no 
				longer exist.<br>
				<br>
				In the last 4 year, I have travelled 4 times in South America to 
				supervise<br>
				WCS projects, I attended the South American Project Fair in 
				Miami and I<br>
				have been two times in Africa for Polio NID (and I am planning 
				to return<br>
				next November). Having been in direct contact with poverty, my 
				choice is<br>
				clear and I have a lot more difficulty to spend time in 
				Fellowships, mostly<br>
				because I consider we can develop a true fellowship thru WCS 
				actions and<br>
				with people we are in contact with when we are and implementing 
				the<br>
				projects.<br>
				<br>
				I don't say that Fellowships are not useful, but personnally 
				that does =<br>
				Not respond to my main and personal vison of Rotary. With the 
				new system no<br>
				doubt will exist about the real mission of the group. You have 
				set a =<br>
				high level selection process and the board appoval will give 
				some =<br>
				credibility to the Action Groups<br>
				<br>
				I am taking this opportunity to share few thoughts about Inter 
				Country<br>
				Committees. First, I have to admitt that I did not put enough 
				time in it, being busy with the 4 WCS projects I am supervising 
				and also being busy with Aline's illness (She is still in a 
				recovery process.). Added to that,<br>
				bussiness requirements and my schedule was completed... For me I 
				discover<br>
				after knowing the day to day needs of the ICC that this is not 
				meeting my<br>
				vision of Rotary. Maybee it is a personnal view but the use the 
				French<br>
				people are doing with ICC does not appeal to me. That's why I 
				will pass the<br>
				hand to Elaine Toussaint on the France-Canada ICC. The most 
				important<br>
				part of the ICC activity for the French people is the student 
				&quot;term of<br>
				probation&quot; in Quebec businesses. They have ask us to find 
				numerous housing<br>
				facilities for their children as well as to find employers who 
				would accept<br>
				to give a job to their students for their term of probation. As 
				Quebec City<br>
				is not a business city it was hard for us to meet their 
				expectations. Also,<br>
				many times they want to find some home stay in English speaking 
				families.<br>
				It's pretty hard to find that in Quebec City!!! This is Rotary 
				fellowship<br>
				but I am not involved in Rotary to find jobs to young whealty 
				French<br>
				students. So, if you hear that the Canada - France ICC was not 
				as efficient<br>
				as it could have been you now know the reason. I sincerly 
				thought that the<br>
				primary reason would be helping each others to have good 
				material in French<br>
				for example or to help French speaking poor countries but it 
				seems that it<br>
				is not their primary concern.<br>
				<br>
				In conclusion and coming back to RAG, I am really happy that you 
				succedded<br>
				in bringing RI to adopt those changes. Thanks for your hard work 
				and<br>
				dedication in this matter and if you need any help or support in<br>
				implementing RAG you can always count on me.<br>
				<br>
				Regards<br>

				To: RID Robert Stuart<br>
				Hello Bob, <br>
				It was a pleasure meeting you at the Rotary in Russia conference 
				in Moscow. The new Russian district should be one of the fastest 
				growing districts in the world. A big thank you to the RI Board 
				for having the vision to make this historic decision. <br>
				<br>
				As mentioned, the Rotary World Health Fair Program is entering a 
				new phase. We have grown from a small Alaska club sponsorship to 
				the need for a broader base of support. We believe that the 
				Rotarian Action Group structure is ideal for this kind of 
				effort. <br>
				<br>
				First of all, the RAG would enable the Health Fair Program to 
				remain under the Rotary umbrella. As you know numerous groups 
				have formed outside of Rotary because they had no other choice 
				(Wheel Chair Found, Hunger Plus, etc.). <br>
				<br>
				Two of the major concerns I have heard is that there is a 
				duplication of services with WCS and that Rotary International 
				would lose control of the activities of the group. <br>
				<br>
				Regarding the duplication, it seems that the World Community 
				Service group is primarily a clearing house for activities, 
				rather than a real action group. <br>
				<br>
				All of these concerns are addressed in the application process. 
				The RI staff must review the proposals and then send them to the 
				RI Board. It would seem to me that the staff and RI Board could 
				screen all new proposals to ascertain whether or not there were 
				duplications, or control issues. If proposals were deemed 
				inadequate they could be denied or returned for revision. 
				Further, annual reports are required of RAG's under the current 
				rules. This would give the RI staff and Board an opportunity 
				once again to review and evaluate the effectiveness of the RAG's.
				<br>
				<br>
				One of the areas of opportunity, in my opinion, is that the 
				Board could encourage different RAG's to collaborate more 
				closely. One example would be the Malaria RAG which has already 
				been approved. If this RAG decided to purchase and distribute 
				mosquito nets, then the Health Fair RAG could plan a fair where 
				the nets could be distributed and where educational information 
				could also be disseminated. Plus other health issues could be 
				addressed at the same time. This would provide a synergy which 
				would enhance both programs. <br>
				<br>
				In conclusion, I would strongly support the concept of RAG's. 
				Hopefully you will look at our proposal and see that it is well 
				thought out, has an excellent track record, and a vital future 
				under the Rotary banner. Please feel free to ask additional 
				questions. <br>

				Rotarian Action Group, including By Laws. <br>

				Dear John:<br>
				<br>
				You are absolutely right when you say that the marriage of the 
				two.....R.C.<br>
				or Rotary District working with the help of any RAG will make 
				good things<br>
				happen. Every RAG needs both Rotary Clubs or Rotary District 
				that is<br>
				closest to site of project so it can be carried out. The 
				marriage is<br>
				vital.<br>
				<br>
				Your Amigo in Mexico City,<br>
				<br>
				Frank Devlyn<br>
				<br>
				(in resonse to the following)<br>
				<br>
				Dear Matts.<br>
				<br>
				Thanks you for this thoughtful piece. I think the element of 
				tolerance and good will - historic elements of our history - are 
				reflected in your viewpoint. Of course, you have hit the 
				conflict button when you say: <br>
				<br>
				&quot;I believe that the Rotary actions take place at the club level. 
				Rotary International's role is to facilitate and support the 
				districts and the clubs in their Rotary Service.------- RAGs 
				need to be designed so that Rotarians can provide their service 
				through Rotary with maximum efficiency&quot;.<br>
				<br>
				It is this inherent conflict between efficiency and club 
				activity that provided the challenge. An accommodating marriage 
				would be helpful and this is why the policy that our 2005 Board 
				established that &quot;encourages RAGS to work through the Club and 
				District network&quot; is a <br>
				helpful starting point for the RAGs committee to consider. The 
				two concepts can, I would submit, be in harmony with one 
				another. We do have to face the reality and recognize that Clubs 
				simply do not have the capacity to do what RAGS can do in 
				International Service (and resource <br>
				groups and RI Committees are not currently structured to be of 
				any tangible assistance). It is the marriage of the two that 
				will bring Rotary truly into its second century of service with 
				the required efficacy that you have suggested is necessary.<br>
				<br>
				Thanks for the comments.<br>
				Best wishes,<br>
				<br>

				At the Convention in Copenhagen, an opportunity was provided for 
				the existing and applicant Rotarian Action Groups to meet. The 
				Chairs of the groups who were aware of the meeting met a the 
				conclusion of the Fellowship Groups Annual meeting in the room 
				provided by Rotary International. The Chairperson of the 
				Fellowships Group requested past director and former liaison 
				director to the Fellowship Committee to Chair the meeting. On 
				consensus by those present, PRID John Eberhard was asked to 
				convene a facilitated discussion on the present status of the 
				RAGs and hear from each of the groups on the progress they are 
				making in their administrative development. The following is a 
				brief overview of the topics covered.<br>
				<br>
				Minutes of Meeting of the Chairpersons of Rotarian Action Groups 
				(CCRAGs)<br>
				<br>
				Tuesday, June 13, 2006<br>
				<br>
				Welcome by John Eberhard, RID 2003-2005, past Director Liaison 
				to Fellowships Committee, ad hoc Chair:<br>

				Item:<br>
				<br>
				The ad hoc meeting, facilitated by John Eberhard PRID, provided 
				all Chairs and potential chairs of RAGs an opportunity to review 
				their programs successes and challenges.<br>
				<br>
				All expressed gratitude to RI for the opportunity to meet for 
				the first time since the formation of the new Global Networking 
				Program. All agreed it that this forum was an important 
				opportunity to share ideas and information about the operation 
				of the Rotarian Action Groups.<br>
				<br>
				Each of the chairpersons gave a brief introduction and up-date 
				on the status of the Rotarian Action Group that they represented 
				or were in the process of forming <br>
				<br>
				The most evident challenge was unanimously observed by all to be 
				the Board of Directors of Rotary International. The group 
				praised the initiative of the segregation of the Global 
				Networking Groups into Service and Fellowship categories but 
				reacted very negatively to the threat to the Rotarian Actions 
				Program by the most recent Board meeting and the “moratorium” 
				placed on applications currently in the pipeline. A positive 
				view was taken of the appointment of the RAGs Committee for next 
				year and the hope was expressed that this committee would have 
				more time to focus on this new paradigm of service, understand 
				its capacity for service delivery and recommend a new positive 
				and collaborative relationship between RAGs and the Board as 
				well as potential collaboration with TRF.<br>
				<br>
				An agenda consisting of various items of interest to all was 
				created on an ad hoc basis<br>
				<br>
				Item:<br>
				<br>
				The following topics were discussed:<br>
				<br>
				• Reviewed Code of Policy issues<br>
				<br>
				• Discussed how the RAGs are working with Clubs and Districts in 
				the Rotary International Network (RIN) in compliance with Board 
				encouragement<br>
				<br>
				• Discussed how RAGs can function within the Code of Policies in 
				respect of Administration matters and funding. All agreed that 
				this was possible and desirable<br>
				<br>
				• Structure of RAGs comparisons<br>
				<br>
				• Consensus that a Presidentially appointed dedicated RAGs 
				committee is formed annually. It was suggested that to be more 
				helpful to RI, members of this committee be experienced and 
				well-known leaders in the field of WCS with specialized 
				knowledge of the sectors in which RAGs are functioning and 
				experienced in the operation of Global Networking Groups.<br>
				<br>
				• A pro-active and engaged Board liaison Director is needed to 
				create a viable link with the Board, the strategic planning 
				committee and the TRF Future Visioning Committee <br>
				<br>
				• There is a need for the Board to consult with Global 
				Networking Groups before policy decisions are made that will 
				impact on these groups. In the past (i.e. insurance and 
				indemnity decisions) the lack of this consultation process led 
				to great angst among the some 75,000 Rotarian Fellowship members 
				worldwide.<br>
				<br>
				• Issues dealing with fundraising practices within an RI mandate 
				were discussed and it was agreed that to date there has been no 
				conflicts. It was stressed that any money raised for programs 
				undertaken by RAGs would not have been donated to TRF for a 
				variety of reasons but it was also noted that clubs doing 
				projects within the broader and larger RAGs programs were 
				raising funds in the usual WCS manner and some taking advantage 
				of matching grants through clubs that were involved in RAGs 
				programs<br>
				<br>
				• A strong consensus was reached that a consultative process 
				with RI would be useful and that a means of coordinating the 
				advocacy from the RAGs groups would be helpful to ensure a 
				consistent message and transparent flow of credible information 
				to the board was essential (many rumors and speculation has 
				given rise to views and opinions on RAGs by Board members that 
				are not based on factual information)<br>
				<br>
				• It was noted that being a member of a GNG gave a reason to 
				attend conventions<br>
				<br>
				• The House of Friendship is an ideal place for Rotarians to 
				become engaged with GNG’s<br>
				<br>
				• It was agreed that policies should be put in place to ensure 
				that the approval of RAGs is done pursuant to a rigorous and 
				consistent criteria. If any policy has not been fully created , 
				it would be in the establishment of such a criteria. Recognizing 
				that the group chosen will be the only one recognized by Rotary 
				in a particular sector, the right decision has to be made for 
				the right reasons. One of these would be its internationality 
				and administrative capacity to perform what service it holds out 
				its expertise to be able to do.<br>
				<br>
				• It was agreed to submit a joint brief to the RAGs Committee 
				(meeting August, 2006) and continue to try to get the positive 
				RAGs message to members of the Board. A more formal structure of 
				some kind was recommended for this purpose. (No decision was 
				made as to how or when this might happen or what its role would 
				be)<br>
				<br>
				The meeting concluded with all congratulating one another on the 
				excellent work being done in the field and the expression of the 
				hope that RAGs would become an engrained feature of the way 
				Rotary does some of its WCS in the foreseeable future.<br>
				<br>
				It was agreed that a meeting be called for Salt Lake City and 
				that all Chairs of RAGs to be invited in advance with a proper 
				agenda established in collaboration with the RI RAGs Committee. 
				It was hoped that that committee and a member of the Board would 
				be represented at the next meeting.<br>
				<br>
				Best wishes were expressed by all.<br>
				<br>

				1) One of my major concerns is lack of continuity. Resource 
				Groups exist only at the pleasure of the President.<br>
				<br>
				2) They have no authority to support long-term initiatives:- 
				despite our ability to generate much interest and enthusiasm 
				Rotarians have no assurance of continued interest or support. 
				Consequently they are unwilling to initiate truly significant 
				programmes. We remain<br>
				short-term, project-focused with few exceptions (which 
				exceptions I am encouraging e.g. Nakuru (20 RCCs working to 
				bring safe water to 1.2 million people), or PRID Sushil's 
				program in Churu.<br>
				<br>
				3) People are appointed to resource groups who may have no 
				interest in the subject but accept the invitation solely to 
				raise their political profile in Rotary.<br>
				<br>
				4) Major NGOs and agencies e.g. Unicef, UNESCO, WaterAid, etc 
				look to Rotary for leadership at the grass-roots level. At 
				present it is difficult for a resource to make any commitment 
				except promising to communicate and encouraging. We risk 
				becoming marginalized in the major<br>
				humanitarian issues of the day.<br>
				<br>

				<br>
				Some comments about Rotarian Action Groups :<br>
				<br>
				- RAGs do have a great, welcome potential to give a boost 
				towards achieving the Object of Rotary, and, also with RAGs, the 
				RI Board will always be able to ensure the integrity of every 
				group or program that carries the name of Rotary. <br>
				<br>
				- RAGs are expected to live according to Rotary standards, 
				guarantee a good transparent flow of information to the RI 
				Board, and , yes, RAGs should submit their Annual Report for 
				verification and ratification, act within the RI policies; and 
				while reasonable concerns of the RI Board need to be addressed, 
				it's paramount that to the RAGs' entrepreneurial advantages be 
				guaranteed the needed protection.<br>
				<br>
				- Just like also the RAGs, the RI Board and TRF are free to 
				enter partnerships. When a RAG does enter any partnership first, 
				it does not exclude one with RI or TRF.<br>
				<br>
				- To the extent RI's Resource Groups and Task Forces will 
				eventually be sufficiently structured, capable and motivated, 
				they have a huge potential to greatly contribute towards RAGs 
				serving always better the Object of Rotary. Yes, they need 
				improvement: increasingly composing them of Rotarians really 
				proactively dedicated to and competent in the purpose of their 
				Resource Group or Task Force.<br>
				<br>
				- RAGs will specialize on their own focus, and work with RI, 
				TRF, the Districts of the area of the project and especially 
				with the local Clubs, including the eClubs. The quality of 
				Rotary service, including WCS', to the community, will grow 
				thanks to RAGs. (WCS is the clearing-house, and RAGs act through 
				the Clubs)<br>
				<br>
				- In the world there's plenty more-than-sufficient funding 
				always available for the best projects and causes, and thus the 
				funding available to TRF will never-, nor can ever be limited in 
				any way by RAGs' fundraising. Ideally, Rotarians best continue 
				to entrust their donations where they choose, and RAGs' global 
				service will motivate Rotarians to increase them, including to 
				TRF. Yes, as a consequence of the RAGs' good work, we shall 
				rather see TRF attracting more funds than now, having an always 
				easier task fundraising, and, more than now, always having all 
				needed funding to fulfill all its goals.<br>
				<br>
				- TRF should continue responding as up to now: supporting as 
				best it can the most worthy projects serving best the Object of 
				Rotary: supporting our Clubs, RAGs, Programs, etc. Indeed, since 
				the RAGs will be doing quality Rotary development work, 
				certainly nothing less than fully including RAGs is likely to be 
				the outcome of the deliberations on this matter the Future 
				Vision Committee.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				- The present RI organization is sufficient to be adapted to be 
				able/capable to monitor the RAGs' performance and standards. RI 
				will rapidly find that RAGs are long overdue: the logical step 
				towards helping Rotary to better achieving its object in 
				Rotary's 2nd century.<br>
				<br>
				- RAGs, just like Rotary Fellowships, should be offered free 
				information booths and meeting space at the RI Conventions.<br>
				<br>
				- Like all in Rotary, RAGs will also participate supporting well 
				Rotary's corporate projects.<br>
				<br>
				- RAGs enhance the beauty of Rotary, and they do definitely help 
				attract many more potential Rotarians to Rotary, thus they also 
				go a long way in retaining Rotarians in Rotary !<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				- RAGs would thus be causing good fellowship and have a unifying 
				effect throughout RI. RAGs have the potential to always better 
				achieve the Object of Rotary by using better the huge, unique, 
				yet quite untapped global potential of Rotarians' competence, 
				experience, enthusiasm, tolerance and good will. <br>
				<br>
				- As RAGs make sure to adapt Rotary to the needs in its second 
				century, RAGs will contribute towards making sure that Rotary 
				remains a strong united organization, in unity in diversity, 
				growing and adapting to the new times and needs of our age. RAGs 
				have the potential towards contributing substantially towards 
				Rotary being recognized as really international and being 
				increasingly respected as such. Just like the United Nations, 
				which Rotary and Rotarians had helped creating as an 
				organization which, despite the fact that its headquarter is in 
				the USA and although a major share of funding still comes from 
				the US, Rotary will increasingly be really accepted as 
				international and as most constructive for- and respected by 
				humankind.<br>
				<br>
				- With their enthusiasm, initiative and entrepreneurial 
				character, making the best of their huge potential of Rotarians 
				working together for a common purpose through service, RAGs are 
				giving Rotary Clubs, and in particular to their participating 
				Rotarians, that long sought-after opportunity for action to 
				provide their special service through Rotary and its districts 
				with maximal efficiency, which was up to now badly missed by a 
				very significant number of Rotarians.<br>
				Since long Rotary has been owing RAGs of Rotary quality to 
				humankind, and now, with the start of Rotary's 2nd century, we 
				finally have them, and, with continuity in their policy &amp; 
				leadership, from now on they will be constantly improved and 
				adapted to the global needs of humankind, flying high the flag 
				of Rotary.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				- Rotary is happiness in helping others, Rotarians and their 
				Rotary Clubs leading the way, united, fighting for a cause, for 
				the sake of humankind, and Rotary is not the fear and prejudice 
				against change and new good and timely developments like the 
				RAGs. These negative sentiments of fear still appear at present 
				and can manifest themselves also through incomplete nor balanced 
				information which sometimes top elected officials of RI are 
				given by staff, and consequently this reflects on- and 
				influences significantly the decisions they will take or vote 
				about. From this may have resulted also the present reluctance 
				to accept the RAGs, or the situation when RI -without consulting 
				the Rotary Fellowships- had decided to try to force them to get 
				insurance, or when, in June 2006, for the second time, a not 
				accurately-informed Board of RI again did not accept the United 
				Nations Fellowship of Rotarians' 2nd application. This 
				non-acceptance of the United Nations Fellowship is another 
				postponement of a great opportunity for Rotary to better serve 
				humankind, because its acceptance would have given Rotary a 
				Fellowship with potential to become a RAG and to achieve very 
				much towards the Object of Rotary, without ever interfering at 
				all in the work done by the RI Representatives to the United 
				Nations.<br>
				A still greater effort needs to be done towards promoting the 
				real RI: the global Rotary International based on, elected by 
				and supporting the Clubs, which best allows Rotary to develop 
				and live towards its full potential, serving humankind best.<br>
				<br>
				- Let's all really contribute making sure that RI henceforth 
				always better undertakes to make the best possible use of the so 
				great input which skilled and experienced Rotarians from 
				everywhere around the world have the expertise, enthusiasm, 
				potential, means and the will to offer ! The Rotarian Action 
				Groups are an optimal vehicle for this ! Through their local 
				projects coordinated, wherever Rotary has already reached, 
				through the local Rotary Clubs and Rotarians' proactive 
				participation, RAGs do contribute making Rotary Clubs more 
				attractive, facilitating new Rotary Clubs, and definitely also 
				increasing and retaining membership.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				- Recently Mr Warren Buffett announced giving over 30 billion 
				US$ to the Gates Foundation which is chaired by Bill Gates' 
				father, reportedly an Honorary Rotarian. <br>
				Why was TRF forgotten at the time when the donor was deciding 
				whom to give his fortune of 30+ billion ? One could argue that, 
				if Rotary had been making better use of its Rotarians' global 
				potential through active RAGs, chances would have been quite 
				higher for TRF receiving a few of those billions.<br>
				<br>
				- How does the Gates Foundation support TRF ? Through the most 
				unique network of Rotary Clubs and most skilled, experienced, 
				and dedicated Rotarians around the planet, TRF has the best 
				potential to optimally use such donated funds to make the 
				biggest difference where the need is greatest. <br>
				<br>
				- Don't we agree that TRF, through the global network of Rotary 
				Clubs, is also better able to practice care in fragile places 
				and making sure to stimulate self-sufficiency rather than 
				fostering dependence or the kind of corruption that often 
				follows aid, and achieve this better than other foundations ?
				<br>
				<br>
				- RAGs will certainly increasingly help inspiring donors to 
				consider TRF when planning such gifts in the future.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				- It was so good and productive to have met in Copenhagen for 
				our first CCRAGs' meeting !<br>
				Starting there and then, at the RI Convention in Copenhagen, our 
				Environment Fellowship of Rotarians is proactively facilitating 
				the creation of several Rotarian Action Groups in a number of 
				environmental areas Rotarians are particularly competent and 
				interested in. <br>
				- To best develop the criteria by which RAGs will be admitted by 
				the RI Board, hopefully RI staff will soonest make good use of 
				the document John Eberhard had prepared on this and submitted to 
				them.<br>
				<br>
				- It's imperative that Rotary improves with the times, adapting 
				to the needs of a rapidly growing and advancing global 
				civilization, and, besides RI and TRF fundamentally 
				re-evaluating themselves and really improving and adapting their 
				own organization and functioning according to a new better 
				corporate management model, RAGs are definitely of the best, 
				long overdue innovations that can happen to Rotary for humankind 
				at the beginning of our new, 2nd Rotary century !<br>
				<br>
				- With the good help, encouragement, support and coordination of 
				RI and its districts, supported always better also by TRF, RAGs, 
				with their unique global network of capable and motivated 
				Rotarians, will Lead the Way, greatly contributing towards the 
				Rotary Clubs' always more efficiently and best fulfilling the 
				object of Rotary !<br>

				Observations on the Concept – Pre June 2005<br>
				These observations were made by interested Rotarians prior to 
				the time that 2005 Ad Hoc Committee met and made its 
				recommendation to the Board. This Committee chaired by PRIP Jim 
				Lacy recommended the creation of the Rotarian Action Group 
				program under a new umbrella program called Global Networking 
				Groups. The original concept name from then RID John Eberhard 
				was Registered Rotary Service Affiliates . <br>

				Registered Rotary Service Affiliates Responses<br>
				<br>
				Mike Thacker<br>
				Dear Mark,<br>
				I have read RID John's proposal, and here are my comments.<br>
				I apologise for not responding earlier about the RRSA proposal. 
				I have been facing some health issues of my own recently. I 
				trust that my thoughts have arrived in time to be recognised.<br>
				I think the creation of RRSAs makes a valuble step in the ares 
				addressed by John in his report. RI officially recognising the 
				areas of concern raised by cause-related Fellowships and dealing 
				with them can only, I feel, help everyone.<br>
				I have only one issue to raise. Membership of an RRSA will be 
				restricted to individual members of Rotary Clubs. Mt Question 
				about this is that some potential members of RRSAs may not be 
				members of Rotary Clubs. Some might be spouses of Rotarians, 
				some might be potential new members of Rotary Clubs who have not 
				yet joined and some might be Rotarians whose health has failed 
				to the extent that they are no longer able to be members of 
				Rotary Clubs. <br>
				Jacob<br>
				First, the name:<br>
				Registered Rotary Service Affiliates (RRSA), could be shortened 
				to just Rotary Service Affiliates (RSA)...with the REGISTERED 
				implied, when listed as a Rotary affiliate. This is simpler, an 
				easier to remember &quot;self-defining&quot; term, and less of a &quot;tongue 
				twister&quot;. <br>
				However, I believe John's proposal makes a lot sense, and now is 
				the time for RI to &quot;move forward&quot; with a new model to continue 
				&quot;doing good in the world&quot;, with willing volunteers.<br>
				Also, as a long time member of a fellowship and the Rotary 
				Friendship Exchange program, (as well as being heavily involved 
				with the development of the www.RotaryFellowships.org web site), 
				I was very excited last year when RI opened the &quot;fellowships&quot; up 
				to any group &quot;wanting do to good&quot; via a fellowship. <br>
				Although, this new breed of fellowship did not always represent 
				a &quot;good match&quot; to the traditional fellowships mold.<br>
				Many of these &quot;new fellowships&quot; were much more focused on 
				specific &quot;service areas and needs&quot; with like-minded Rotarians 
				providing the resources to a specific stated objective. Hooray! 
				When we have such a willing bunch of volunteers...encourage 
				them. And, don't hamstring them with administrative minutia. <br>
				Unfortunately, however, because of these new fellowships greater 
				need to raise funds (to support their goals and objectives), 
				certain oversight and liability issues arise, (that do not 
				effect the traditional &quot;fellowships&quot;). And, this proposal allows 
				for the tailoring of these needs to fit these new entities, 
				while allowing the traditional fellowships to continue to grow 
				in an unencumbered manner (as the Stamp Collectors, who can not 
				afford the required &quot;liability insurance&quot; that was initially 
				mandated for ALL fellowship).<br>
				If the proposal is adopted, then I assume the &quot;service and 
				medical&quot; type &quot;fellowships&quot; would be moved over to the new RSA 
				model entities.<br>
				Finally, I question (as did Jacob Taurins) as to WHY &quot;Rotarians 
				ONLY&quot; would be allowed to be members of a RSA. There are many 
				&quot;willing volunteers&quot; out there looking for the opportunity &quot;to 
				serve&quot; their fellowman (but not able or willing to come to 
				weekly club meetings). I see them as a minority of the 
				demographics of the RRSA's, with Rotarians clearly in the 
				forefront, but let the family of Rotary be inclusive rather than 
				exclusive.<br>
				Yours in Rotary Service,<br>
				Mike Thacker<br>

				Mark;<br>
				&#61656; I am responding to the proposal put forward to form RRSA's. I 
				find myself very much in agreement with the sentiment expressed 
				by Mike Thacker. I am in agreement with pursuing this direction, 
				on the condition that it would not affect the fellowships such 
				as ours, (International Fellowship of Curling Rotarians). Our 
				fellowship is only organized to provide an opportunity to 
				compete in a sport that we all enjoy. It has no fund raising 
				function. Could you provide some clarification on this point?<br>
				<br>
				Dear Mark<br>
				<br>
				Firstly, let me express our condolences for the tragedy that has 
				struck your nation and its people. The devastation is so 
				extensive that it is unimaginable.<br>
				As requested I am responding, as a member of the Rotary 
				Fellowships Committee, to the issues you raised in recent 
				emails. I have reviewed the emails, including the document 
				entitled &quot;Registered Rotary Service Affiliates&quot;. It appears that 
				the issues arising concern fellowship groups that go beyond mere 
				fellowship to raise money and provide service.<br>
				Based on the information at hand, I have concluded the problem 
				is not the vocational and recreational fellowship groups, but 
				rather the cause related fellowship groups.<br>
				The cancellation of our insurance and the requirement for the 
				fellowships to provide indemnification agreements is widely 
				opposed for good legal reasons. <br>
				These moves have the possibility of causing fellowships to fold 
				or to start operating outside of Rotary. As a member of the 
				Fellowships Committee I oppose both the cancellation of 
				insurance and the indemnification requirement.<br>
				I have the following additional comments.<br>
				Has R.I. considered sharing the insurance costs with the 
				fellowships. This would no doubt be better than forcing 
				fellowships to obtain their own insurance, which in fact may not 
				even be possible, or the cost prohibitive.<br>
				R.I. needs to tailor its approach by finding suitable solutions 
				for those cause related groups that have been identified as 
				having undue risks, rather than sweeping all the fellowships 
				under a new policy.<br>
				Additional criteria need to be developed around the &quot;Application 
				for Recognition as a Rotary Fellowship&quot;.<br>
				On a personal note I have belonged to a recreational fellowship 
				for 23 years and would be very disappointed to see it disappear 
				because we were forced to personally indemnify R.I. (Our 
				fellowship gets together once every two years for a curling 
				competition) <br>
				<br>
				We have also been asked to comment on other issues as outlined 
				by Jesse Allerton. My comments are as follows:<br>
				<br>
				1. Circularization Policy Agree<br>
				2. Cooperatice Relationship Policy Agree<br>
				3. Obtaining Funding from Other Organizations Agree<br>
				4. Criteria for Recognition Based on my experience as a commitee 
				member since 2004, it is an area that needs development after 
				some of the issues currently before <br>
				the R.I Board have been dealt with.<br>
				<br>
				Respectfully submitted<br>

				Re: Ad Hoc Committee on Fellowships, RI Board, and RRSA's<br>
				<br>
				Dear John<br>
				<br>
				1. Congratulations on a great initiative, a good paper and some 
				patchy proposed solutions.<br>
				<br>
				2. Fundamentally, you are trying to solve the problem of an 
				octopus not being able to make forward progress, by attempting 
				to coordinate the individual activities of newly grown legs, and 
				to do so by proscribing under legal rules how each leg will 
				move.<br>
				<br>
				An external management consultant brought in to analyze Rotary 
				might ask whether it was possible that the ‘legs’ were actually 
				doing the things that were innovative and appropriate to 21st 
				Century activities, and whether the core body’s activities had 
				fallen behind the times. <br>
				<br>
				3. Your paper outlines a reasonable approach to an interim 
				solution that, we assume, a nervous board believes it needs to 
				‘protect’ RI from litigation and from anyone/anything not 
				board-sanctioned taking Rotary down ‘the wrong path’. <br>
				<br>
				So the paper in essence outlines a defensive response to a set 
				of facts and circumstances. We wonder whether looking at the 
				identical glass of milk, seen as half full, might not suggest to 
				the board that some of the ways and means of these innovative 
				‘affiliate’ entities might enhance the effectiveness of the core 
				of the organization.<br>
				<br>
				In other words, the proposed solutions in the paper stem from a 
				central board wanting to exert power and control; we wonder what 
				‘solutions’ might look like if the core body was seized of the 
				thinking that these new entities are overwhelmingly 
				opportunities, not problems.<br>
				<br>
				4. We would like to make some points that apply to organizing 
				the structure/activities in Australia. We think that Australia 
				has possibly unique, or at least unusual, opportunities in 
				relation to Rotary organization, pro-activity and promotion. 
				Many of our opportunities/issues might be shared with Canada, so 
				you personally may well appreciate where we are coming from.<br>
				<br>
				5. However, before getting to Australia-specific issues, we 
				would like to comment on your proposed solutions. Please note 
				that the critiques, and the commentary, are a view from the 
				active coalface. They are meant to help you improve what we 
				think could be an excellent, interim initiative…but it needs 
				some fundamental re-thinking as to approach/attitude:<br>
				<br>
				RRSA (‘arssa’): what an awful name. How about something less 
				anal and less bureaucratic, more euphonic, like RAP (R. 
				Activities Program) or RASP (R. Affiliate Service Program).<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Suggested solution Comment<br>
				1. Inc. in Illinois, approved by Gen Sec of RI, in accord RI 
				policy NO. For example, take RACE, the R. Australia Centenary 
				Exhibition – why should we have incorporated in Illinois, for 
				goodness sake? In general, in future, the fewer things 
				incorporated or based in the USA the better. See 3. above.<br>
				If anything, incorporation should be in the least litigious and 
				least costly nation/society in the world, not the most. 
				Preferably, though, in the home country, or a country of 
				convenience for $$$/legal reasons.<br>
				The Gen Sec should not ‘approve’ – let market forces apply. If 
				100 or 1000 people in three countries are interested in joining, 
				then the entity can proceed. Prevent more power going to GS/RI.<br>
				2. Dues to RI on numbers in entity NO. The people in the 
				entities you are trying to corral are the most active, 
				go-getting, best Rotarians we have. Why double-penalize your 
				best members, by making them pay dues twice? There should not be 
				double taxation but - if there were - a better approach would be 
				to ‘double-tax’ Rotarians who are NOT members of these active 
				entities.<br>
				This suggested solution, by itself, indicates that the overall 
				approach is to contain, rather than empower. What a shame, what 
				lost opportunity.<br>
				<br>
				3. Assess own risk, secure insurance coverage YES, sensible. But 
				the insurance cost will be much greater if incorporation is in 
				Illinois, rather than in Botswana or Victoria.<br>
				Maybe we need a ‘Bahamas’ RI shell for insurance &amp; other 
				reasons? Or Canberra, Australia. Why not?<br>
				4. Provide a hold-harmless statement YES sensible, but in 
				practical terms, if the proverbial hits the fan, not worth the 
				paper on which it is writ.<br>
				5. Restricted to R. members YES and NO. Suggest the wording 
				should be that ‘FULL’ membership is restricted to R. members 
				(but that other grades of membership are open to appropriate 
				people/entities).<br>
				6. Be a licensed vendor for (ROTARY) materials…, remit 10% to 
				TRF NO. We have inserted ‘Rotary’ before materials, in which 
				case a %age return to Rotary is sensible. But not TRF, unless it 
				is TRF product. TRF might be considered by a management 
				consultant to be a sheltered workshop, overdue for a fundamental 
				review of all its programs, and the way clubs breast-feed it, 
				possibly to the detriment of other potential initiatives.<br>
				If an entity designs/produces its own ‘badged’ material, perhaps 
				including the R. logo, the entity should be entitled to any 
				profit (with maybe a case for a licensing fee being paid to R., 
				but not to TRF). <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				7. Recognized for matching Grants, 3-H Grants NO. This is 
				control by backdoor stealth. The minute an entity takes such a 
				grant; it comes under the uncertain, fluky hand of District 
				Governors, and further RI control. Any entity would be crazy to 
				so limit itself for money that it could raise itself, more 
				quickly and more easily, with fewer strings.<br>
				8. Eligible to register as R. Volunteers and receive grants. NO. 
				For exactly the same reasons as immediately above. This 
				suggestion appears to be a control device.<br>
				9. Able to circulate OWN MEMBERS and outside sources provided 
				they get individual DG approval. NO. An entity can circulate its 
				OWN MEMBERS whenever it likes, surely. <br>
				As to trying to get DG approval, that is a minefield of 
				time-wasting, bureaucratic incompetence by a significant 
				percentage of Dig’s – we personally have been through exactly 
				this process in Australia with 23 DG's in the past 12-24 months, 
				and it does not work in practical terms. We guarantee that to be 
				a fact. The entire DG system needs major surgery.<br>
				10. No circulating Rotarians for money YES, agreed this is 
				sensible.<br>
				<br>
				11. Recognized in RI directory;<br>
				authorized to create its own website YES to Directory <br>
				‘Authorized to create its own website’: Of course an entity 
				should be able to create its own website, with or without RI 
				Board, DG, or any other approval. Again, this clause suggests 
				that the document is more about control than proactively using 
				these entities to further the works of R.<br>
				12. Subject to policy re RI marks Yes.<br>
				13. Subject to the cooperative entities policy of RI Unable to 
				comment. What is the ‘cooperative entities policy’? Where do we 
				find it? To what does it apply now? <br>
				14. Report to GS annually, including sponsorship detail YES…but 
				this will become a nonsense, because who in RI is competent to 
				‘assess’ these reports each year. You’ll have to add 2 staff to 
				RI just for this purpose! And then what??? What would/will RI do 
				as a result??? <br>
				15. File a financial report annually. YES…but this is overkill, 
				as it would be a requirement of incorporation.<br>
				15. Compliance grandfathered Yes, but perhaps 2-3 years for 
				conformity is more practical – some entities will have to hold 
				AGM's to comply, which may involve at least one cycle (up to 23 
				months), in terms of giving notice, meeting, etc.<br>
				<br>
				We hope the above thoughts help your deliberations. We counsel 
				that an assumption that the RI board is in the right, and that 
				people and entities doing innovative things away from the 
				certainly historic, and possibly anachronistic, early 20th C 
				management model of RI are wrong, and need to be curtailed and 
				reined in.<br>
				<br>
				There must be newer corporate management models that might be 
				considered for Rotary/RI governance in the 21st Century. Might 
				not the second 100 years usefully start with a fundamental 
				re-evaluation of the status quo? Please see below for an 
				Australian option.<br>
				<br>
				RE Australia, and similar situations:<br>
				<br>
				For a country like Australia, with large area and limited 
				numbers, there is opportunity being wasted because Rotary 
				insists on operating within a district structure, rather than 
				shaping appropriate Rotary activities to the way the nation 
				(that is, the logical geographic boundary) is structured and 
				operates. <br>
				<br>
				For many situations and projects, an Australia-wide approach 
				would make practical, economic, and communication sense. We have 
				national newspapers, national TV networks, national radio 
				conglomerates…but Rotary is not structured to interact 
				appropriately with these important conduits of Rotary messages.<br>
				<br>
				There is enormous duplication in having to approach 23 different 
				district governors to try to get a ‘national’ approach on any 
				issue or project. You can virtually guarantee that one (or more 
				likely perhaps 3-5 DG's) will have unique, individualistic 
				approaches or thoughts, and will prevent reaping the benefits of 
				a national program or project. In Australia’s case, the nation 
				is a continent, one of six major divisions of the world.<br>
				<br>
				We believe Australia needs a Rotary structure that can empower, 
				endorse, ‘approve’ and – particularly – add value to projects 
				and programs better planned and managed nationally than by 
				district or club operating without the benefit of combined 
				action. <br>
				<br>
				It is no surprise that, when RI wanted to trial a major 
				advertising campaign a few years ago, it chose Australia (and 
				Canada). One of the reasons for the choice was undoubtedly the 
				homogenous nature of Rotary within those countries, and the 
				greater impact advertising could have across a nation, rather 
				than organizing the advertising by district. <br>
				<br>
				RI’s own actions in relation to advertising seem to prove the 
				point we are making. <br>
				<br>
				Rotary districts do not represent sensible geographic or 
				administrative boundaries within a large nation like Australia. 
				For example, in Adelaide, the capital of the State of South 
				Australia, there are basically two districts splitting the 
				metropolitan area to achieve an outcome of urban clubs being 
				mixed with rural clubs. Great for Rotary administration perhaps, 
				senseless for practical program management, citywide projects 
				and communication with the metropolitan public.<br>
				<br>
				The same holds true for virtually all our capital cities in 
				Australia.<br>
				<br>
				We propose that Australia has:<br>
				<br>
				a. A national Australian committee to consider, endorse and 
				authorize projects that would be better run on a national basis<br>
				- for example, the Rotary Australia Centenary Exhibition, Model 
				United Nations Assembly, National Youth Science Forum, 
				Australian Rotary Corporate Alliance Program, Adventures in 
				Citizenship, Rotary Youth Leadership Awards, Rotary Youth 
				Program of Enrichment, etc.<br>
				<br>
				b. That the national committee has a membership of something 
				like:<br>
				- 2 District Governors,<br>
				- 2 representatives of club presidents/secretaries,<br>
				- 3 ordinary Rotary members of under 5 years standing, devoid of 
				titles, double initials, or any of the other paraphernalia that 
				comes with age in Rotary, and<br>
				- 1 representative of the Rotary Down Under magazine<br>
				- 3 ‘outside’ representatives, all non-Rotarians, all under the 
				age of 30.<br>
				<br>
				If this suggestions starts to find favour, then operating rules 
				could be drawn up. Basically, though, the committee would be 
				charged with promoting Rotary on a national basis by actions and 
				words. Clubs, Districts, groups of Rotarians could apply to it 
				for project/program ‘endorsement’.<br>
				<br>
				We envisage two direct outcomes;<br>
				<br>
				i. a maximum of 10 national projects/programs running at any one 
				time, but usually restricted to no more than 5;<br>
				<br>
				ii. one of the committee (probably the chair, but not 
				necessarily so) being the designated ‘Australian spokesperson’ 
				for Rotary, to help give the organization a national face and 
				name, which it sadly lacks in terms of representation on 
				non-government organization (NGO) national committees, in 
				dealing with the Federal Government, in the media, etc.<br>

				<br>
				Thank you for your proposal John that I have also passed on to 
				some other PDG's on our Long Range Planning Committee. I expect 
				they will respond to you directly.<br>
				<br>
				In principle I believe that the Social and Fellowship of Rotary 
				is critical to its well-being. The opportunity to broaden our 
				knowledge about living in other parts of the world enables us to 
				be better able to understand the way other people live, their 
				problems, their dreams and the challenges they face. It can come 
				as quite a surprise when it can be<br>
				quite different from our own. I think it is critical however 
				when World Community Service comes into play. My own experience 
				is that this personal contact through Rotary Fellowship adds 
				dependability, enthusiasm and satisfaction when you know your 
				counterpart and the challenges he/she faces. In my case it was 
				in South Africa in District 9270.<br>
				<br>
				Encouraging the Fellowship contacts should be easier through a 
				more formal association like RRSA should help and it would be 
				easier to identify those members who have a real interest in 
				Rotary beyond there borders.<br>
				<br>
				This can also apply to making Fellowship connections with clubs 
				in other Provinces and perhaps your clubs could share a project, 
				particularly after becoming friends. A formal membership in RRSA 
				would identify those interested and this would be a start.<br>
				<br>
				I also am concerned that many smaller &quot;Big City Clubs&quot; are 
				facing a major challenge. The demands on their time working has 
				increased and employers are less likely to allow time to attend 
				their Rotary meeting and many are not members in the community 
				where they live, but where they work. Many in our small club are 
				self-employed. However developing a connection with a third 
				world club through a RRSA might become attractive. Certainly we 
				like to do things as a group and this is the glue that keeps us 
				active.<br>
				Incidentally we are considering a new non member attachment 
				called&quot;Friends of Rotary&quot; These are people who help us with our 
				projects, are interested in our activities but are unuble to 
				commit the time (and perhaps money) to become a club member. We 
				are one of the few clubs that are authorised to try new ways. 
				This is still back to the theme that fellowship is the driver.<br>
				<br>
				I am not in a position to comment on the formal structure of 
				RRSA but do feel that availablility to Insurance coverage would 
				be important, but I also understand the cost factor when older 
				members travel.<br>
				<br>
				I hope this helps John and I wish you and Fran a wonderful 
				Christmas and<br>
				a rewarding 2005.<br>

				Dear Director Eberhard:<br>
				<br>
				Andrew McDonald shared a copy of your Registered Rotary Service 
				Affiliates proposal with me, in which you requested his 
				feedback, as my area works most closely with the fellowships, 
				the RI Fellowships Committee, and the RI Board Committee on 
				Fellowships. Susan Schneider will be working with Director David 
				Morgan on developing an advanced memorandum for the committee, 
				and we will be sure to include reference to and a copy of the 
				materials you have provided here.<br>
				<br>
				Your proposal addresses many of the issues that I believe the 
				committee will discuss in the context of the philosophical 
				debate about what the purpose and scope of the Rotary 
				Fellowships program should be. I had a few questions when 
				reading your proposal that committee members may have as well.
				<br>
				<br>
				1. If the Rotary Fellowships program was to return to its 
				recreational/vocational focus (bottom of you page 1), would 
				fellowships be permitted to conduct any of the activities that 
				RSSA would be established to conduct (service activities, 
				fundraising, cooperative relationships, etc.)? Why or why not?<br>
				<br>
				2. Would RRSAs be eligible for booth space at the RI Convention 
				similar to fellowships? <br>
				<br>
				3. Concerns have been raised in the past that groups of this 
				nature conflict with task forces and committees appointed by the 
				President. I would recommend expanding on the point you raise on 
				page 2 about how an RRSA can accomplish something that 
				committees and task forces do not. I would also recommend 
				including a provision in your proposal about how RRSAs and task 
				forces or committees with the same focus should work together.<br>
				<br>
				4. In point 2 of the proposal, you have the RRSAs paying dues to 
				RI on the same basis as clubs, with the Board setting annual per 
				capita dues. Do you mean the RI Board or the RRSA Board? What 
				services would RI provide in exchange for these dues? Could 
				RRSAs collect independent dues of their members for their 
				administrative costs? Would this inhibit the independence of 
				these groups?<br>
				<br>
				5. In point 5, membership is restricted to Rotarians. Some 
				groups may be interested in expanding this to include 
				Rotaractors and spouses.<br>
				<br>
				6. Point 7 would need to be approved by the Trustees.<br>
				<br>
				7. Point 8 is not necessary. Rotarians and non-Rotarians may 
				register as Rotary Volunteers so any member of an RRSA would be 
				able to register. TRF Funding is a separate matter, with 
				separate qualifications for Individual Grants or district 
				simplified grants. If the RRSA member is a Rotarian, spouse, 
				Rotaractor, or qualified Foundation Alumni, he or she can apply 
				for an individual grant. However, for district simplified 
				grants, each district establishes their own guidelines for use 
				of the funds, so the Board could not automatically grant 
				eligibility to members of an RRSA.<br>
				<br>
				8. Are you recommending that RRSA become a new structured 
				program? If yes, what support and services would the general 
				secretary provide to these groups? How would RRSAs interact with 
				clubs and districts? In your document, RRSA is sometimes 
				referred to as an official program, an unofficial program, a 
				Rotary entity, or compared to items of the menu of service 
				opportunities. <br>
				<br>
				Please note that there were a few minor inaccuracies in your 
				document that may lead to some confusion:<br>
				<br>
				1. With respect to the draft policy for cooperative 
				relationships (C-2 from the November 2004) requiring fellowships 
				to notify the general secretary when seeking financial 
				assistance from other organizations in excess of US$25,000, on 
				the bottom of page 3 you state that at least two groups have 
				raised funds by avoiding RI policy. However, since there is not 
				any current policy, no fellowships groups are in violation. 
				Additionally, on the bottom of page 6 you say that an 
				unintentional result of this policy would impact fellowship 
				groups with large administrative budgets such as yachting or 
				flying. As long as these groups do not get their administrative 
				budgets from outside organizations as grants in excess of 
				US$25,000, it would not apply.<br>
				<br>
				2. On page 3, please note that the WCS Resource Network was not 
				a fellowship--it was a pilot project until 1997 when it was 
				discontinued by the Board. The general secretary recommended to 
				the Rotarians who had been active in the WCSRN that they form a 
				fellowship, and they received recognition as the Humanitarian 
				Services Resources Fellowship. Also, there have been no 
				applications for an &quot;International Service&quot; fellowship--I 
				believe the one you are referring to is the &quot;Peace&quot; proposed 
				fellowship. This raises an important point for the Board to 
				consider with the current fellowship policy, any group meets the 
				criteria, but there is sometimes inconsistency in who is granted 
				recognition. (For example, hunting met the criteria but was not 
				recognized).<br>
				<br>
				3. On page 5-6, you list non-club organizations functioning 
				outside of policy. This list includes many different types of 
				groups, some of which are completely independent organizations 
				with no Rotary affiliation, and may cause confusion among the 
				committee and others who received your proposal. Most of these 
				groups are in complete compliance with all RI Board policy. For 
				clarification, I've grouped them according to type:<br>
				<br>
				Type A--Independent Non-profit Organization with loose Rotary 
				affiliation (in many cases started by Rotarians, incorporated as 
				501C3)<br>
				* Rotaplast<br>
				* Interplast (I believe this is what you meant by cleft palate 
				repair, although that is what Rotaplast does too.)<br>
				* Hunger Plus and Shelter Box (Disaster Relief programs on your 
				list)<br>
				<br>
				Type B--Independent Non-profit Organization involved in a Board 
				approved cooperative relationship with Rotary International. 
				These are NGOs that often work with Rotary clubs locally, but 
				were not started by Rotarians, and are not Rotary entities.<br>
				* United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)<br>
				* International Reading Association<br>
				* Goodwill Industries International<br>
				<br>
				Type C--Rotary club, district or multi-district projects that 
				have come to the attention of the Board recently because of 
				improper usage of the Rotary Marks or other issues<br>
				* Rotary Yoneyama Memorial Foundation<br>
				* RADAR<br>
				* Rotary Camp<br>
				* Australian Rotary Corporate Alliance Program<br>
				* Paul and Jean Harris Home Foundation<br>
				* Program Rotablind<br>
				<br>
				If you have any questions about these observations, please let 
				me know.<br>

				Sorry for the delay in sending this. I was out of time. 
				Difficult to stay home when you are semi retired.<br>
				<br>
				Thanks to RID John for his proposal.<br>
				<br>
				Here are my queries:<br>
				<br>
				1. Are we going back to &quot; Vocational &amp; Recreational 
				Fellowships&quot;?<br>
				<br>
				2. Where does the Medical Fellowships&quot; fit in?<br>
				<br>
				3. Will the &quot; Service Fellowships&quot; be operating within WCS?<br>
				<br>
				4. How will the main issue of &quot;Fund raising&quot; addressed.<br>
				<br>
				I agree with Mike Thacker. The name should not be a tongue 
				twister. The 'Rotary Service Affiliates&quot; should be sufficient.<br>
				<br>
				I do not agree with his idea of opening to non Rotarians. If 
				someone is interested in &quot;Service&quot;, he or she should be 
				encouraged to be a Rotarian. What percentage of Rotarians come 
				to weekly meetings anyway ( except for a few of us)?<br>
				<br>
				With all &quot;Best wishes for A Merry Christmas and A Very Happy New 
				Year&quot;<br>

				Strategic Plan for Rotary. Surely it extends beyond 4 years. 
				Fellowships offer new avenues for growth, not the least of which 
				would be providing service to the world’s polio survivors; some 
				of whom have not yet been born.<br>
				This not too subtle snub of PSA has nothing to do with 
				Fellowships in general. On the basis of the information you have 
				presented your RFA proposal appears to be the most likely to 
				insure that Rotary “senior leaders” would actually begin to 
				grasp the possible opportunities for Rotarians and that the 
				“leadership” of Rotary would actually support them in word and 
				deed.<br>
				I know your submission is already in the hands of the Directors 
				who have been appointed to the Committee. I hope it did include 
				Polio Survivors and that the typist caught the error of listing 
				Dental Volunteers twice…ray<br>
				In any case, please accept my thanks for your efforts and the 
				wish for good luck as well as the possibility of some open minds<br>

				Registered Rotary Service Affiliates<br>
				RI Director John Eberhard Proposal, November 2004<br>
				<br>
				Comments of Ray Taylor (PDG7690)<br>
				Chairman Polio Survivors &amp; Associates Fellowship<br>
				<br>
				The comments below do not necessarily represent the opinions of 
				the Directors of PSA (above) but are based upon personal 
				experience and perception after several years of Fellowships 
				Committee experience.<br>
				<br>
				1. The proposal speaks to a marketing need and responds to the 
				dictum: “See the need” “Fill the need”. (See page 9, second 
				paragraph under “The Results”)<br>
				2. Fellowships in their current definition respond to the First, 
				Third and Fourth “Object of Rotary”: “…acquaintance as an 
				opportunity for service”; “…the application of the ideal of 
				service in each Rotarian’s personal…life”; “…The advancement of 
				international understanding, goodwill, and peace through a world 
				fellowship…united in the ideal of service”.<br>
				3. They meet the elements of the 4-Way Test.<br>
				4. The issue before the RI BdDir may be to reexamine our product 
				and our method of delivery.<br>
				5. Based upon the assumption that our product is SERVICE (at 
				least for the past 80 years) it is reasonable to assume that our 
				method of delivery of this service should be examined to be sure 
				we had adopted a viable and effective method.<br>
				6. The RRSA proposal is recognition that today’s market offers 
				opportunities to utilize the time and talent of Rotarians who 
				have special interests in special needs.<br>
				7. The establishment and operation of the Fellowships website 
				www.rotaryfellowships.org is an example of a grass roots 
				recognition of a “need” and the way to fill it. This was done 
				and is operated at no cost to Rotary.<br>
				8. The key issue in the success of any idea or program is to 
				have a “sponsor”. RRSA would provide an “official” imprinteur, 
				that Fellowships have lacked in the past. <br>
				9. The proposal recognizes the importance of “risk management”. 
				The deciding factor must be the reward to be gained by those in 
				need balanced by the perceived risk to RI. This cannot be 
				avoided regardless of any path taken or not taken.<br>
				10. The overwhelming success of Polio Plus is the best example 
				of Rotary’s ability to reach out of other organizations in the 
				world to achieve significant goals. The RRSA proposal recognizes 
				both the need and the ability to achieve great things through 
				world-wide cooperation.<br>
				11. The By-laws of our Polio Survivors and Associates Fellowship 
				recognizes that our success depends upon working with people and 
				institutions already in the field of helping polio survivors. 
				P.J. Abdul Kalam, president of India recognizes the “need” upon 
				which PSA is built in his comments (page 8, December issue “The 
				Rotarian”: “Concerned that not enough is being done to alleviate 
				the suffering of those who are already stricken by polio (he) 
				encouraged the private sector to team up with government to 
				improve the lives of those for whom the eradication initiative 
				is too late.”<br>
				Comments regarding Page 8 – “The Solution”<br>
				<br>
				A. In general it appears that most of the 16 items would be both 
				feasible and helpful, and I am in agreement except for questions 
				and comment concerning the following:<br>
				B. # 3 This seems vague…I believe RI must assume whatever risk 
				there may be. (See item 8. above)<br>
				C. # 5 This item is not in compliance with the idea of the 
				“extended family of Rotary. Many of us believe we need to “reach 
				out and welcome” rather than restrict. (It would negate the 
				whole premise of PSA…see 10 above)<br>
				D. # 6 Fellowships do not like the idea of paying an additional 
				10% for apparel or promotion items for their own membership 
				development and would resist or ignore. A case could be made for 
				items used in fund-raising, but this would be vague at best and 
				probably ignored.<br>
				<br>
				Additional Observations and Suggestions<br>
				<br>
				1. My old Webster’s Dictionary lists 10 entries or uses for the 
				word “fellowship” and by extension (s). Fellowships are like the 
				definition of Art…it is in the eye of the beholder. We do not 
				need an additional definition, we need a new way to deliver our 
				product (service).<br>
				2. The traditional Recreational and Vocational Fellowships do 
				not need RI staff support to survive and grow. They need 
				recognition but not support. The custom of providing space at 
				district, zone and international meetings should be encouraged 
				and expanded. At no significant cost to Rotary.<br>
				3. The greatest strength of Fellowships or “interest groups” is 
				their relevance to the lives of the individuals involved and of 
				the perceived benefit or value derived from their association 
				with their peers.<br>
				4. Rotarians are people who join, contribute, participate, or 
				commit to because they believe they will derive a benefit. This 
				is a major contributing factor to the rise in membership 
				turnover. No relevance; no benefit; no member.<br>
				5. Page 1 of December issue of “The Rotarian” features the 
				President’s Message and in the last three paragraphs he 
				reiterates what he has said before, that Rotary helped to “open 
				doors” and he benefited from the fellowship and new friends he 
				made there. <br>
				6. Past RI President, Cliff Dochterman uses the phrase, “The 
				fellowship of Rotary is friendship at its best.” Fellowships and 
				“interest groups” are the essence of friendship and 
				understanding, which our founder Paul Harris said is the element 
				that holds it together.<br>
				7. I suggest the RI BdDir give comprehensive consideration to 
				John Eberhard’s proposal and to act upon the idea of improving 
				our model or method of delivery of out product – SERVICE.<br>

				It was good to get your Dec. News about the Rotary International 
				Membership Coordinators. It is good to see so many Proactive 
				RIMIC's setting a good example for RIMZC's as well as District 
				Membership Coordinators. Without a doubt President Glen Estess 
				is proud of all you are doing to promote membership &amp; retention 
				in this our Centennial Year.<br>
				<br>
				Good to see that many of you are also promoting both my Frank 
				Talk books that can be ordered at www.franktalkbooks.com or 
				www.frankdevlyn.org <br>
				<br>
				All of you know that besides promoting Our Rotary Foundation, I 
				am part of your team effort in promoting Rotary as well as 
				Retention. That is the reason all of you get very special prices 
				for the above Frank Talk books whose major reason for being was 
				&amp; continues to be to promote Rotary Membership &amp; Retention. 
				Somehow we have to get the message out to The World of Rotary 
				that we can not be &quot;Pennywise &amp; Pound Foolish&quot;. In today's world 
				where companies pay headhunters 3 months salary when they get 
				the right person, it should be a message to all of us that we 
				have to also invest to<br>
				get qualified persons into Rotary. In my personal opinion Rotary 
				Clubs have to take time to talk to qualified candidates, give 
				them a Frank Talk book, and not charge them or the Rotarians who 
				invite them for their first visits to our clubs.<br>
				<br>
				Let me tell you that I never miss a chance to promote the 
				benefits of Rotary Membership. <br>
				<br>
				Last week I was asked to be a keynote speaker at the University 
				of Mexico's School of Business Administration to a group of 
				about 700. They wanted me to speak on The How, Why of the 
				Success of The Devlyn Optical Group in Mexico &amp; Central America. 
				I stressed the importance of the following concepts: Changing 
				With The Times, Having a Passion in the services we provide our 
				customers, having a goal of making Customers For Life. I think 
				many of you will find that these concepts are also applicable to 
				Rotary.<br>
				As I always do, I also spoke on the benefits of belonging to 
				Rotary. I suggested that they the students consider belonging to 
				Rotaract as they would have contact with Rotarians who could 
				give them ideas on how to Get Ahead. <br>
				<br>
				I also suggested that they strive to occupy a top position in 
				whatever field of business that they get into and the benefits 
				of having a goal of trying to join a Rotary Club that would give 
				them added Credibility in their community &amp; among other business 
				&amp; professionals persons.<br>
				<br>
				On Dec. 8th. I was asked to speak to the Intl. Convention of 
				Dale Carnegie Franchisee's &amp; Key Executives in Can Cun (Mexican 
				Caribbean). This is a well known Organization that promotes 
				courses that help people have more confidence in themselves. As 
				many of you know, I many times recommend to Club President 
				Elects &amp; other club officers that they take one of the Dale 
				Carnegie Courses that will help them or at least read the book 
				How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People as I did over 40 years 
				ago. Once again this group of almost 1000 persons wanted me to 
				speak on how the Dale Carnegie Philosophy had helped me 
				personally to move The Devlyn Optical Group to occupy one of the 
				leading positions worldwide. Once again, I did not miss the 
				opportunity to promote Rotary. I told them that yes..Dale 
				Carnegie was one of the different reasons I had been able to get 
				ahead but....What after Dale Carnegie??????<br>
				<br>
				I told them that many of them who were owners of a Dale Carnegie 
				Franchise or held a Key position in a Franchise could be 
				candidates to join a local Rotary Club. Their belonging showed a 
				sincere interest in being part of their community plus the added 
				benefit of Additional Credibility.<br>
				<br>
				I told them that not all those who take their courses have the 
				qualifications to belong to Rotary which basically are having a 
				key position in the companies they work for or in their own 
				profession or business. I made them see that for the graduates 
				of their courses who have the above characteristics, Rotary had 
				much to offer. Yes, I did recommend my Frank Talk book on the 
				benefits of belonging to Rotary.<br>
				<br>
				Well Amigos, I have given you an update on my promoting Rotary 
				Membership carried out in the last week. I hope the above serves 
				as an example that we should always be on the outlook to find 
				ways to promote Rotary Membership at outside events to which we 
				might be invited.<br>
				<br>
				Keep up the good work promoting Rotary in a way that enhances 
				Rotary's image &amp; at the same time is in accord with the good 
				taste &amp; culture of your area.<br>
				<br>
				I hope that all of you are personally proactively recommending 
				at every opportunity the reasons we should all support our 
				Rotary Foundation with added &amp; needed donations to carry out 
				more humanitarian work.<br>
				<br>
				Gloria Rita joins me in wishing all of you Happy Holidays at

				Your Amigo Frank Devlyn<br>
				<br>
				There is so much information to digest in the detailed paper on 
				Registered Rotary Service Affiliates given to us by Director 
				John Eberhard.<br>
				<br>
				My first impressions that we are possibly making things too 
				complicated &amp; we should just trust Rotarians like Rotary Clubs 
				to do what is Right. Then I see that we have to protect Rotary &amp; 
				then I say to myself......Protect Rotary from doing Good 
				Things??? In today's world I suppose we have to do this 
				protecting.<br>
				<br>
				It is about time that Rotary Intl. stopped putting its head like 
				an Ostrich in the sand. Sometimes I wonder if our Senior 
				Leadership of the many wonderful things that Rotary District 
				projects are doing &amp; that includes Fellowships. Our Senior 
				Leadership on an individual basis knows about many of these 
				things when they visit different areas of the world &amp; they 
				usually congratulate all the Rotarians involved. Example here in 
				my country of Mexico the nine districts have come together from 
				several years back to<br>
				combat increased delinquency by supporting a program of 
				Neighborhood Watch called Vecino Vigilante in Spanish. This 
				program has even had support from Our Rotary Foundation in the 
				form of Grants for Plastic Signage that is put up in front of 
				homes, businesses, etc. If we sent this program to the Board of 
				R.I. we would be lost in a maze of some Not Understanding, etc. 
				We who have to live with this problem are doing all we can to 
				combat crime. Just a few days ago I had a meeting with the 
				President of Mexico who supports this program as do other key 
				cabinet members. The Rotarians will join forces with all the 
				Scouts plus hundreds of other groups to show the citizens of 
				Mexico how to come together block by block. Is everybody in 
				Rotary Mexico for it..........NO......but the vast majority is 
				supportive. We have been the catalyst to possibly help the 
				Mexican Govt. get money from the Interamerican Development Bank 
				of Washington to help.<br>
				<br>
				I can remember years back when knowledgeable well meaning 
				Rotarians would<br>
				whisper....I believe that Rotary Club or district has a local 
				foundation. We have found out that there are about 4000 from 
				some estimates. These clubs that have local foundations are 
				usually stronger than those that do not. We in the Rotary 
				Foundation are looking for ways that we might get more help from 
				them. An example is the Philadelphia Rotary Club Foundation that 
				matched money for Polio Plus besides other projects with clubs 
				in their district.<br>
				<br>
				The mentioning of 25,000 dollars as having the necessity to 
				report to the General Secretary does sound good but it way too 
				low &amp; would simply hold back many projects. As the incoming 
				Chair of The Rotary Foundation I am astounded to know that we 
				spend 2400 dollars to monitor a small grant of 2000 dollars. I 
				am astounded to learn that we have 10 million dollars of money 
				to use for Matching Grants but if we sent in the necessary grant 
				requests our Foundation Staff tells us they do not even have the 
				time to<br>
				look at them. I am trying to show that we sometimes make things 
				that seem logical &amp; then we find out it is just too complicated 
				to monitor.<br>
				<br>
				I trust John Eberhard &amp; Ken Morgan who are apparently handling 
				this complicated situation to do what is best for Rotary so we 
				can move forward &amp; not be tied down to carry out good Rotary 
				work we can all be proud of.<br>
				<br>
				When I digest more of this very detailed report, I will get back 
				to all of you.<br>
				<br>
				Happy Holidays to all my Amigos.<br>

				<br>
				John, this was an extremely well-thought-out proposal and 
				obviously done with a great deal of research!<br>
				<br>
				Are the efforts by these groups that you list on page six 
				siphoning off dollars that would normally be put through clubs, 
				districts and/or RIF efforts? It certainly seems a control of 
				some kind must be established by Rotary to cause a better focus.<br>
				<br>
				Certainaly I have never thought about the Rotary Recreational 
				Fellowships, that I assumed were primarily hobbyists getting 
				together with other hobbyists, turning<br>
				into fund-raising organizations outside of what Rotary clubs, 
				districts and RIF do. <br>
				<br>
				I do have a concern about the costs of Rotary International to 
				oversee this new body and how it gets passed on to the general 
				membership when it's now being covered by the entities 
				themselves.<br>
				<br>
				It sounds like RRSA would help get things back under control 
				without creating too many hard feelings from the splinter 
				groups.<br>
				<br>
				Please keep me informed. Lee<br>

				Ray Taylor<br>

				Fred...<br>
				<br>
				As the Chairman of the Rotary Vocational Fellowship of Law, I 
				certainly hope someone has talked with you about the RI BdDir 
				&quot;concerns&quot; about Fellowships; especial the part about 
				&quot;Liability&quot;...if you are able to read all the way through this 
				attached correspondence you will find Director John Eberhard's 
				&quot;trial balloon&quot;...quite a number of people have weighed in on 
				the subject and I will not burden you with them; however,<br>
				I wonder if it is time and/or appropriate for Rotary to deviate 
				somewhat from the path of &quot;non-political&quot; to begin to 
				investigate some sort of &quot;hold harmless armor&quot; for non-profits 
				in the business of helping people who need help...my gut feeling 
				is that there is presently no such protection...for example, the 
				successful suits against church groups related to sexual 
				misconduct...if the present administration is successful in 
				funding &quot;Faith Based&quot; enterprises, surely this will escalate 
				opportunity for &quot;liability&quot; unless some safeguards are<br>
				involved...<br>
				<br>
				You will recall we went through this exercise some months ago in 
				a slightly different context; however, the issue is basically 
				the same...&quot;who protects whom against what from whom&quot;, as we 
				carry out our mission...as you know, most Fellowships have no 
				resources other than their members and certainly none of them 
				wants to find him or herself in<br>
				a personal liability situation which would be a disaster for all 
				concerned...on the basis a &quot;Fairness&quot; alone, shifting liability 
				downward does not get very close to the 4 Way Test...<br>
				<br>
				Surely there is something more creative we can do than argue 
				where the responsibility lies...and surely there is something 
				more beneficial than paralysis of fear...<br>
				<br>
				I am not empowered to take any particular action on this very 
				difficult situation; however, if you feel you can contribute, I 
				am sure John and Ken would be more than willing to hear your 
				thoughts...<br>
				<br>
				As you know from previous correspondence, the Polio Survivors 
				Fellowship expects to have a &quot;float&quot; in the Centennial 
				Parade...I am hoping RI has some kind of &quot;single event coverage&quot; 
				for those of us who are trying to participate...<br>
				<br>
				Thanks, and good luck, whatever...ray<br>

				<br>
				With the strengthening of the Service aspects of groups of

				groups…we are all aware that the RAGS will require a closer 
				working relationship with RI than has been our past experience 
				with Fellowships…while RAGS open a whole new set of

				those who welcome it, they offer some new challenges in their 
				operation…<br>

				I appreciate the effort and commitment you have displayed in our

				Dear Amigos:<br>
				<br>
				There is so much information to digest in the detailed paper on 
				Registered Rotary Service Affiliates given to us by Director 
				John Eberhard.<br>
				<br>
				My first impressions that we are possibly making things too 
				complicated &amp; we should just trust Rotarians like Rotary Clubs 
				to do what is Right. Then I see that we have to protect Rotary &amp; 
				then I say to myself......Protect Rotary from doing Good 
				Things??? In today's world I suppose we have to do this 
				protecting.<br>
				<br>
				It is about time that Rotary Intl. stopped putting its head like 
				an Ostrich in the sand. Sometimes I wonder if our Senior 
				Leadership of the many wonderful things that Rotary District 
				projects are doing &amp; that includes Fellowships. Our Senior 
				Leadership on an individual basis knows about many of these 
				things when they visit different areas of the world &amp; they 
				usually congratulate all the Rotarians involved. Example here in 
				my country of Mexico the nine districts have come together from 
				several years back to combat increased delinquency by supporting 
				a program of Neighborhood Watch called Vecino Vigilante in 
				Spanish. This program has even had support From Our Rotary 
				Foundation in the form of Grants for Plastic Signage that is put 
				up in front of homes, businesses, etc. If we sent this program 
				to the Board of R.I. we would be lost in a maze of some Not 
				Understanding, etc. We who have to live with this problem are 
				doing all we can to combat crime.<br>
				Just a few days ago I had a meeting with the President of Mexico 
				who supports This program as do other key cabinet members. The 
				Rotarians will join forces with all the Scouts plus hundreds of 
				other groups to show the citizens of Mexico how to come together 
				block by block. Is everybody in Rotary Mexico for 
				it..........NO......but the vast majority is supportive. We have 
				been the catalyst to possibly help the Mexican Govt. get money 
				from the Interamerican Development Bank of Washington to help.<br>
				<br>
				I can remember years back when knowledgeable well meaning 
				Rotarians would<br>
				whisper....I believe that Rotary Club or district has a local 
				foundation.<br>
				We have found out that there are about 4000 from some estimates. 
				These clubs that have local foundations are usually stronger 
				than those that do not. We in the Rotary Foundation are looking 
				for ways that we might get more help from them. An example is 
				the Philadelphia Rotary Club Foundation that matched money for 
				Polio Plus besides other projects with clubs in their district.<br>
				<br>
				The mentioning of 25,000 dollars as having the necessity to 
				report to the General Secretary does sound good but it way too 
				low &amp; would simply hold back many projects. As the incoming 
				Chair of The Rotary Foundation I am astounded to know that we 
				spend 2400 dollars to monitor a small grant of 2000 dollars. I 
				am astounded to learn that we have 10 million dollars of money 
				to use for Matching Grants but if we sent in the necessary grant 
				requests our Foundation Staff tells us they do not even have the 
				time to<br>
				look at them. I am trying to show that we sometimes make things 
				that seem<br>
				logical &amp; then we find out it is just too complicated to 
				monitor.<br>
				<br>
				I trust John Eberhard &amp; Ken Morgan who are apparently handling 
				this complicated situation to do what is best for Rotary so we 
				can move forward &amp; not be tied down to carry out good Rotary 
				work we can all be proud of.<br>
				<br>
				When I digest more of this very detailed report, I will get back 
				to all of you.<br>
				<br>
				Happy Holidays to all my Amigos.<br>
				<br>
				Please continue to Create Awareness &amp; Take Action by sharing 
				ways for<br>
				Rotary Clubs to Celebrate Rotary.<br>

				<br>
				Thanks, John, for sending me a copy of your proposed report to 
				the AD Hoc Committee on Fellowships, for my comments. My delay 
				in responding does not indicate any disinterest in the topic, 
				but merely the fact that I have been running around the past 
				couple of months, talking about the Centennial to far too many 
				Rotary meetings.<br>
				However, let me give you a few random comments after having read 
				your proposal a couple of times. These are not in the order of 
				importance, but merely as they come to mind. <br>
				<br>
				General thoughts on Fellowships: It seems to me that the 
				recreational, vocational and special interest Rotary Fellowships 
				are rather fundamental to the first part of the Object of 
				Rotary. Friendship, fellowship, acquaintanceship are all steps 
				to service. Some of the pleasures of service come from working 
				along with friends who have a common interest -- just as there 
				is pleasure in seeing the satisfaction of one's efforts among 
				those you serve. So, Fellowships are and should become evenmore 
				a part of Rotary's future expansion and development. As a matter 
				of fact, I would hope that the number and types of Fellowships 
				would expand to manygroups with common interests -- sports, 
				hobbies, interest in special kinds of service, common health 
				conditions, common experiences, and other similar interests. <br>
				<br>
				There is a whole segment of Rotarians who could get involved in 
				the activities of Rotary through Fellowships. There are 
				thousands of Rotarians who belong to small or medium sized clubs 
				where the opportunity to talk with, share experiences, and find 
				and enjoy common interests are extremely limited. But, a 
				Fellowship can spread around the world, across borders and 
				oceans to share Rotary experiences with new friends with a 
				common characteristic interest. <br>
				<br>
				Is Rotary activity model found only in individual Clubs? 
				Certainly, much of the activity of Rotary is within individual 
				clubs. But, we also find many districts with extensive levels of 
				activity. In 1980, the debates on adopting the 3-H program 
				clearly indicated that Rotary can undertake program far greater 
				than any one club or district could handle. Those were hard 
				fought debates, but the conclusion was that Rotary could be far 
				more than just a club -- and thus the best example is the 
				PolioPlus Program and all of its various ramifications. I don't 
				think that the PolioPlus Program was &quot;an exception&quot; -- the 3-H 
				program gave Rotary a new model to undertake &quot;corporate 
				programs&quot; if that is the name one wishes to give. There have 
				been several major 3-H programs with large scale corporate 
				support – the PolioPlus Program is just the largest and longest 
				enduring activity. <br>
				<br>
				Are we splitting hairs when we discuss Rotary program entities? 
				Perhaps this is just a bit of philosophy or twisting the meaning 
				of words. I am always concerned when we<br>
				want to divide or segregate Rotary as &quot;the menu of service 
				opportunities&quot; and&quot;structured programs&quot; and those which are not 
				Rotary entities, and those which the RI Board supports and those 
				which it doesn't. As I understand it, the menu of ten service 
				opportunities are those which Rotary Boards have over the years 
				&quot;accepted&quot; for the<br>
				program staff to administer. It is almost impossible to name an 
				activity which in some respects couldn't be up within one of the 
				10 items. And yet, there are many activities of great 
				humanitarian and service value being conducted by Rotary Clubs 
				which apparently are not appropriately considered acceptable in 
				some ways. In Australia we have, or did have, the FAIM (Fourth 
				Avenue In Motion) to do international projects, but the Board 
				never accepted the program, and yet it did great things. We have 
				Rotaplast, Hungerplus, Gift of Life, Goodwill Industries, and 
				others, all started by and involving many Rotarians, Clubs and 
				Districts, but somehow there seems to be a shadow on these kinds 
				of program being considered &quot;acceptable&quot; service opportunities. 
				We have dozens of clubs and districts delivering wheelchairs to 
				disabled individuals, but some feel this should not be 
				considered a Rotary activity. We have programs for children, 
				called Rotakids, youthact, or something, which is apparently not 
				an accepted program. We have hundreds of Rotary Clubs sponsoring 
				Scout troops, athletic teams, summer camps, but these are not 
				necessarily on our accepted list. <br>
				We have clubs and districts sponsoring handicamps and schools 
				for disabled individuals, but these are not specifically on the 
				list of service opportunities. There are Rotarians sponsoring 
				Meals on Wheels, Water wells, care for refugees and so many 
				other kinds of activities, which are so socially valuable, but 
				not endorsed by Rotary. The reason I raise these kinds of 
				questions is that our attempt to divide programs which are 
				within the &quot;official programs&quot; and &quot;unofficial programs&quot; becomes 
				very hazy. For example, it may be difficult to draw clear 
				distinctions between a recreational Fellowship of Runners and 
				Physical Fitness, and a cause-related Fellowship of Rotarians 
				with Physical Disabilities. I just wonder if we really need to 
				make divisions, distinctions, and determine what is an 
				acceptable entity and what is not? <br>
				<br>
				Is a &quot;service function&quot; by a Fellowship necessary? I assume that 
				some groups share their enthusiasm, knowledge, resources and 
				interests -- and some don't. Does it really make a difference if 
				a group is &quot;project-minded&quot; or not -- especially if the project 
				is useful to somebody, and not harmful or destructive to others? 
				From a practical standpoint, is there really harmful results 
				merely if a project somewhat encroaches upon other activities? 
				As, I see it, virtually all programs which clubs and districts 
				engage encroach upon other activities -- district fundraising 
				and dues affects club finances; Presidential Conferences affects 
				district conference attendance; Foundation giving effects 
				community project fundraising; district assemblies and PETS 
				impact upon club finances; district committees and functions 
				compete for club members time; the Permanent Fund contributions 
				affect the Annual Programs Fund, etc. Our response must be -- 
				Rotary is big enough to have tolerance for all, room for all, 
				acceptance to the many interests and activities of a worldwide 
				organization. We have and must continue to think in the largest 
				possible scale if Rotary is to grow and reach our greater 
				potentials. <br>
				<br>
				Is a new Rotary entity necessary, such as RRSA? Frankly, I have 
				a few doubts whether a new &quot;unofficial program&quot; is necessary.
				<br>
				<br>
				As I read the proposed plan for Rotary Affiliates, I kept asking 
				myself, &quot;why is this needed?&quot; Can't our whole program of 
				recreational, vocational and special interest<br>
				Fellowships just expand and can't we be more tolerant of the 
				activities of various groups of Rotarians? The rationale seems 
				to me to be that many of our current senior leaders have on 
				their hands two or three Fellowships which represent activities 
				or philosophies which they disapprove, or feel that the groups 
				are out of control. If this is the case, then why not address 
				the problems with those specific Fellowships, and not generate a 
				whole new unofficial program? On the other hand, can it not be 
				recognize that in the wide wide-world of Rotary there will 
				always be some very fine Rotarians who think somewhat different 
				from others. I don't think that the RI Board will ever be able 
				to design enough programs -- either officially or unofficially 
				-- to meet the historically differences in the thinking of 
				various cultures, religions, races, customs and interests of all 
				Rotarians. So, why not move in the direction of an organization 
				which has a tent large enough to cover all Rotarians -- and not 
				just those which some Board in the future believes is acceptable 
				or not. In other words, I would lean towards a position in which 
				our Fellowships would be inclusive of all points of view, even 
				those in which some feel a strong commitment, and not be 
				limiting to ideas which are currently considered acceptable. If 
				a group violates the policies of Rotary in their enthusiasm, 
				then you deal with that problem -- but, I question whether the 
				whole idea of International Rotary Fellowships of recreational, 
				vocational and special interests should be re-directed. It seems 
				that RRSA opens a door far greater than the current problems 
				with a few Fellowships. I think you will have RRSA's far beyond 
				your wildest imagination.<br>
				<br>
				Fellowships provide a unique opportunity. I feel that you made a 
				key point on page three, in which you note that &quot;fellowships 
				groups become increasingly popular because<br>
				there is no other Rotary entity that provides the scope or 
				opportunity to address these issues of human need.&quot; To me, this 
				is the fundamental point of why fellowships are<br>
				performing a valuable unit in the Rotary world. I would make 
				effort to have far more tolerance of the Fellowships, rather 
				than moving to some other structure. <br>
				<br>
				Fundraising within Fellowships. To me this has never seemed to 
				be a real problem. Rotary's mission is to serve in the community 
				and in the world. It is quite possible<br>
				that Fellowships will be able to serve in a way that The Rotary 
				Foundation is unable to handle. Sure, The Rotary Foundation is 
				our major fund raising mechanism in Rotary. But, it is clear 
				that the Foundation is not meeting the needs of many Rotarians 
				and clubs. <br>
				Many groups are going outside the Foundation to achieve their 
				objectives. If some worthy humanitarian, educational, social or 
				health issue is being addressed, we should<br>
				be pleased, not distressed. Let's take the big picture. (I 
				remember during the war in Bosnia in l992-93, we wanted to help 
				refugees who had to flee their country -- and The<br>
				Rotary Foundation said there was no way they could help. So, we 
				went to the Districts, and the Governors raised about $8 million 
				in cash, goods and supplies in a matter<br>
				of two months to provide refugee relief in Croatia. And it is 
				estimated that we saved the lives of 100,000 people from 
				starvation and freezing that winter.) I realize that<br>
				when you are so close to the Foundation, that any funds raised 
				by other groups are competition -- but the cause is still good 
				and is within the spirit of Rotary. <br>
				Furthermore, I suspect that you will find that a very high 
				percent of the members of Fellowships are the same people who 
				give to support The Rotary Foundation. <br>
				<br>
				Cause-related vs Special interests: I find that the report 
				frequently uses the term &quot;cause-related&quot; groups which tends to 
				place that term in a negative or zealot category. It seems to me 
				that identifying these as Rotarians who have a &quot;common or 
				special interest&quot; is a fairer or more accurate description. I am 
				very much interested in prevention of drug abuse and disaster 
				relief and the environment, but hardly think that I or my Rotary 
				friends who share a similar interest are zealots, or have 
				tremendous pent up energy or determination to promote these 
				causes, if you wish to call it that. <br>
				<br>
				The name Registered Rotary Service Affiliate? As you go ahead 
				with the program, I hope that a new name will develop. It seems 
				a bit awkward. <br>
				<br>
				Alternate Solution: I suspect that what is really needed is 
				listed in item 14 and 15 of your &quot;Solution.&quot; If all Fellowships 
				would report to the General Secretary annually on each of its 
				activities, fundraising, costs, and membership, along with a 
				financial statement, many of the problems would be covered. <br>
				<br>
				Well, John, these are some of the comments. I have other 
				thoughts about the various affiliate organizations and those 
				with whom clubs and districts join in activities -- but<br>
				that is another subject. <br>

				Comments on the draft RRSA paper<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				John, thanks for giving me the opportunity to comment on your 
				paper. I appreciate the time and thought you have given to this 
				subject.<br>
				<br>
				Let me start by saying I was quite surprised to learn of the 
				concern amongst current and past board members with respect to 
				the service related Fellowships. I was applauding the Board on 
				allowing for more relevant Fellowships, while they would seem to 
				be threatened by them. That is too bad. <br>
				<br>
				Likewise I have found the increasing anxiety over liability 
				somewhat puzzling. I will come back to that later.<br>
				<br>
				For me service and fellowship are the yin and yang of Rotary. I 
				believe the two should go together, always. So for me the notion 
				of Fellowships that are just focused on fellowship, good times, 
				and hedonistic pastimes always struck me as an oddity in Rotary. 
				However I learned over time, that just as the early Rotarians 
				quickly figured out – service is what gives meaning to Rotary, 
				as have many of the Fellowships found a way to weave service 
				into their fellowship activities. From my perspective that is 
				the way it should be.<br>
				<br>
				The vocational/professional Fellowships are a logical way to 
				further the Vocational Avenue of Service. While others like ROTI 
				have provided services of assistance to Club Service. Sill 
				others as you note in your paper have added a service component, 
				be it mission of mercy flights or disabled ski days or sailing 
				programs for quadriplegics.<br>
				<br>
				In a purist sense – I would argue that Fellowships that just 
				focus on fellowship – don’t fit the Rotary model. However, I 
				know that building international fellowship amongst Rotarians, 
				however it happens, makes our organization much stronger. I am 
				told that Rotarians who belong to Fellowships tend to stay in 
				Rotary longer than those who don’t. That may or may not be the 
				case – but intuitively it makes sense. I certainly can attest to 
				my involvement in ROTI as having added Rotary friendships around 
				the world.<br>
				<br>
				I would equally have trouble with the flipside – that is 
				Fellowships that just focus on a service activity without much 
				attention to Fellowship. These run the risk of becoming just 
				another form of a Rotary service program. However again, I 
				recognize as your paper does, that Rotarians want to make a 
				difference as Rotarians – and need linking organizations that 
				can bring together Rotarians and Rotary clubs from around the 
				world to work together.<br>
				<br>
				Nevertheless, I believe that what has enabled Rotary to grow and 
				sustain itself is the prime importance of the individual Rotary 
				Club in Rotary. . I think that anything that takes away from the 
				individual Rotary clubs as the focal point of Rotary runs the 
				risk of being extremely detrimental to the long-term viability 
				of Rotary. For that reason – our District has learned to stay 
				away from District projects. We sometimes have District 
				initiatives that a majority or occasionally all of our clubs 
				support – but they are almost always joint club projects – the 
				District may have been the catalyst and we may have a district 
				committee – but the decision to participate is up to the club.<br>
				<br>
				If we compete with clubs for time, talent and financial 
				resources, we risk under-mining the viability and purpose of the 
				individual Rotary club – which is central to Rotary. <br>
				<br>
				Now to the matter at hand.<br>
				<br>
				I think that your proposal to create a new class of 
				organizations within Rotary is an intriguing idea.<br>
				<br>
				I proposed forming the Fellowship for Mine Action because 
				Rotarians were looking for a means to collaborate between 
				various Rotary clubs and Rotarian started initiatives to join 
				the global effort to rid the world of landmines and help those 
				affected by them.<br>
				<br>
				The Seattle conference had past a motion calling on RI to 
				establish a task force – but as your paper notes, task forces 
				have value to focus Rotary attention on an issue but not to 
				really sustain a Rotary service program. An informal group has 
				been started six months earlier to link existing Rotarians 
				already involved in the issue. However to be sustainable over 
				the longer term – a more robust organization and structure was 
				required,<br>
				<br>
				As the only vehicle open to us, was a Fellowship – we chose that 
				route. However in doing so – we were determined that we would 
				follow the rules for Fellowships. RFMA – has from the start, as 
				set out in our purpose statement, precluded the Fellowship from 
				mounting projects. We will work to engage Rotarians in the issue 
				– help interested Rotarians and Rotary Clubs link with others 
				and other Rotary organizations. Provide Rotarians with 
				information and ideas but leave the actual doing up to them. 
				However we need to have a fellowship side – which develops the 
				international friendships on a personal level that Rotary is so 
				famous for doing. We will have, like some other fellowships 
				opted to have at least a biannual event at the annual RI 
				convention. <br>
				<br>
				In the case of our cause, to be an effective player in the 
				global movement to eradicate landmines, we need to collaborate 
				with like interested organizations. An umbrella organization 
				like our Fellowship can play that role, where individual rotary 
				clubs could not. However, we have understood from the start that 
				we have to be very clear that we do not speak for Rotary 
				International. <br>
				<br>
				Which I think brings us to our first major issue. If Fellowships 
				or the RRSA’s as you have proposed, are active on the world 
				stage RI needs a clear set of policies and protocols about how 
				these sub-Rotary organizations interact with the world 
				community. <br>
				I certainly agree that there have to protocols and procedures 
				around such matters as affiliations with non-Rotary groups, 
				relationships with UN agencies, public relations, and the like. 
				For instance, I have encouraged the US State Dept to organize a 
				conference of their landmine action partners – they in turn have 
				asked me to participate in the program – which I will do and 
				make clear that I am not speaking on behalf of Rotary. I will 
				let Evanston know – but I think there should be some specific 
				protocols in place to ensure that Rotary is not mis-represented.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				With close to a hundred Fellowships out there – and with the 
				constant churn of leadership of Fellowships like the rest of 
				Rotary – compliance based upon goodwill and intentions will not 
				likely be enough.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				I think there can be a real net gain for Rotary at least in 
				terms of the public’s perception of what Rotary does in the 
				world – if the Rotary affiliation is clearer than it is in some 
				cases now. I would use the example of Mine-Ex a landmine action 
				group started by Rotarians in Districts 1980, 1990 &amp; 2000 about 
				10 years ago. You have no idea that it is a Rotary organization. 
				Yet Rotary clubs in those districts have put considerable effort 
				and money into landmine action through that channel. The world 
				should know that – it is something we can all be proud of.<br>
				<br>
				I am conflicted on the issue of Fellowships or the proposed RRSA 
				– raising money for projects. On the one hand Rotarians have a 
				lot of call on their personal giving and their own club and TRF 
				fund-raising (depending on their culture) and I am not sure that 
				other Rotary organizations should be making a direct claim. To 
				my mind encouraging clubs and Rotarians to get involved in an 
				issue, to start their own project or to support anther club’s 
				project is different that campaigning for funds for a project 
				started by a Fellowship or RRSA. It competes with the clubs for 
				and the TRF for individual Rotarians finite financial 
				contributions.<br>
				<br>
				Yet, I realize that Fellowships have been organizing 
				fund-raising campaigns for quite some time and have of course as 
				you noted, done good work with those projects.<br>
				<br>
				Also there are sources of Funds that Rotary clubs either do not 
				have access to or are not tapping into on their own. An obvious 
				example is CRCID. Although historically we got to CRCID by a 
				different path – the reality now is that Rotary clubs don’t have 
				direct access to CIDA foreign assistance funds. Without CRCID – 
				that source of funding would not be available to Canadian clubs.<br>
				<br>
				Likewise, our Fellowship has been able to tap into some US State 
				Department support for building up our Fellowship infrastructure 
				to increase our capacity to increase awareness of the issue – 
				that money would not have been available to an individual club.
				<br>
				<br>
				So in cases like that, neither CRCID nor we are competing with 
				clubs we are actually adding to the resources available to 
				Rotary. I am sure that other Fellowships have similar stories to 
				tell.<br>
				<br>
				I certainly agree that every Rotary entity has to be accountable 
				for monies it raises and expends on behalf of Rotary. I agree 
				that if the RSSA concept goes forward and whether it does or not 
				– the Fellowships should have to file an annual financial 
				statement with RI. <br>
				<br>
				Many of the fellowships have local chapters of the association – 
				at a district, regional, national or continental level. I have 
				found in the short history of the RFMA - that we have had clubs 
				requesting to join as a club rather than as individual 
				Rotarians. We have required the latter, but if we were to have 
				new service related organizations – I think provision should be 
				explicitly be made for clubs and districts to join directly – 
				don’t limit it to individual Rotarians. It makes absolute sense 
				for the Fellowships, but not for a service vehicle. <br>
				<br>
				The Fellowship rules require multi- country participation, at 
				least to get initial approval – which is appropriate for the 
				Fellowships. While that might also be a condition of the RRSA’s 
				it would not recognize the reality of what already exists in 
				terms of affiliate organizations. So while we might encourage 
				and certainly allow for multi-district RRSA’s, I would not rule 
				out single district ones.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				On a related front – I don’t think the suggestion in your 
				proposal that the affiliate organizations should have to 
				incorporate in Illinois will work. I don’t actually see the 
				point. For instance would you really want to go to the expense 
				of incorporating CRCID in Illinois – would it still be legible 
				for CIDA funding if it was. For Affiliates based in other 
				countries be it the UK or India – I don’t think it makes any 
				sense to require them to incorporate in the USA. This is an 
				international organization – it is the fate of history that our 
				headquarters is in the State of Illinois – but two –thirds of us 
				are not Americans – many Rotarians don’t speak English. To 
				require incorporation to start with is I would argue an 
				unnecessary expense but to have to do it in the USA is I would 
				argue unnecessary. <br>
				<br>
				In the case of RFMA – so long as we do not incorporate – our 
				banker BMO provides free banking services. <br>
				<br>
				You raised the issue of circularization of clubs in your paper. 
				I do think there should be some protocols in place. I read the 
				Code of Policy closely before RFMA did some of it. I could see 
				no rule that applied to the Fellowships – but I think there 
				should be some. Mind you I think the should also apply to RI and 
				the TRF too – the credit card mailings still annoy me. <br>
				<br>
				On the risk management side, I think Rotary has been barking up 
				the wrong tree. I have not seen any risk assessment dealing with 
				either the activities of the clubs nor the Fellowships. However, 
				if there is such an assessment, then I think RI should be 
				working with the clubs and the Fellowships to ensure that they 
				change actually begin to manage and reduce the risk. All 
				insurance does is buy financial protection to lessen or avoid 
				the liability of the risk. Just buying insurance makes no sense 
				in the business world – it makes no more sense in the volunteer 
				world. If we have a risk problem – we need to manage it – and 
				yes perhaps insure what we cannot manage – but jumping to 
				insurance rather than managing the risk is an expensive option.
				<br>
				<br>
				For example as a Rotarian involved in the RFMA – the biggest 
				risk I am exposed to on a daily basis is the keyboard I am 
				writing on. Having spent my day at a computer – spending my 
				evenings aggravates my wrist injuries. On the other hand, the 
				traditional Fellowships should actually be of bigger concern – 
				Fly-ins, scuba diving trips, ski meets etc – those kind of 
				events are more likely to result in someone getting injured than 
				when a Service Fellowship holds a meeting.<br>
				<br>
				I don’t believe indemnifying RI is practical either. Why would 
				we invoke a rule that would put individual Rotarians at 
				financial risk – we should be looking to protect them not expose 
				them. I cannot think of a better way to kill the Fellowships or 
				the proposed RRSA’s. If after having developed a risk management 
				strategy – RI concludes that insurance is needed because of 
				possible financial risk then perhaps the most cost effective 
				solution will be to enhance the insurance Rotary carries. <br>
				<br>
				I certainly agree that as an organization we need to protection 
				the Rotary brand, including our name and logo. <br>
				<br>
				While I don’t have any problem with the rules applying to 
				Fellowships or the proposed RRSA’s. – I think we have a 
				longstanding problem. Rotary clubs regularly get club wear etc 
				manufactured through local suppliers and do not and will not 
				forward a % to RI. Many Rotarians feel overtaxed by RI as it is 
				– they aren’t going to add to the cost of a T-shirt by sending 
				something to Evanston. I don’t think you will have much more 
				luck with RRSA’s on this score either. A topic for another day.<br>
				<br>
				As my earlier comments suggest, appreciate senior Rotary leaders 
				concerns about other Rotary entities competing with the TRF for 
				funds. I think that is something we should be concerned about. 
				Like you, I don’t know enough about how the current Fellowships 
				are raising money to know if there is any real impact. I would 
				guess that is some cases that may well be.<br>
				<br>
				However, that is in part because of the way the TRF operates. We 
				really do need to examine the way the Foundation raises funds. I 
				don’t think it is very effective. We rely way too much and are 
				going to rely even heavier on individual Rotarians. I don’t 
				think it is a winning strategy.<br>
				<br>
				My experience tells me that it is always easier to raise money 
				from people, including Rotarians, for a specific cause – much 
				more difficult for a general fund or what is perceived as a 
				black hole. I need only reference Rotary’s two very successful 
				campaigns to raise money to eradicate Polio – much, much better 
				than our annual fund raising for the TRF generally. Even though 
				the money went to TRF&gt;<br>
				<br>
				So – when Fellowships do encourage Rotarians and clubs to 
				financially support a particular initiative – be it Frank 
				Devlyn’s Blindness initiatives – or the Night of 1,000 Dinners 
				for landmines or for HIV/AIDS – those efforts have a better 
				chance of resonating with Rotarians, Foundations, individuals 
				and corporations. <br>
				<br>
				I don’t think your proposal of requiring a 10% tithe on the RRSA 
				will work either. Two years ago – we designated 15% of Night of 
				1,000 Dinners to TRF (it was the year I was Governor trying to 
				get the Polio money and increase Foundation giving) we got a lot 
				of push back from Clubs – they already felt like they had 
				contributed enough to the Foundation – and didn’t appreciate us 
				mixing the two causes. On another practical basis – it some 
				cases – it would not be possible. For instance, I don’t think 
				CIDA would permit us to direct 10% of the funds CRCID receives 
				for a program to go to TRF. Or if a group got money from some 
				external Foundation for a particular service project – hiving 
				off a % for the TRF would not be acceptable.<br>
				<br>
				But on the flipside – I am not sure that the RSSA’s should have 
				access to limited TRF funds – certainly not if they are not 
				contributing. That would put them in competition with individual 
				Rotary clubs – I think that undermines the Rotary Clubs and 
				would worsen the rather fragile relationship between TRF and the 
				clubs. However that need not preclude individual Rotary clubs 
				seeking TRF’s support in relation to a project carried out by a 
				club that the RSSA helped coordinate.<br>
				<br>
				Finally having the RSSA’s members paying dues to RI will be 
				strongly resisted – that is like double taxation. The current 
				Fellowships all have small membership fees – because the 
				Rotarians are already paying club dues, district assessments, RI 
				dues and magazine assessments. If the Fellowships and RRSA’s 
				have to hike the fees to pay a second set of dues to money 
				hungry Evanston – many will be forced out of business. It would 
				be a hugely unpopular move.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				In conclusion:<br>
				<br>
				I think the issues that the issue of service minded Fellowship 
				has sparked really merit a lot of discussion and consideration. 
				As we commence our second century of service we have to review 
				our approaches – especially to international assistance. The 
				club centered international projects has often limited the size 
				and usually means one-off projects – we are really fooling 
				ourselves if we think that is an effective approach. So the 
				possibility of mounting more meaningful programs of 
				international assistance through Fellowships or RRSA’s is 
				attractive.<br>
				<br>
				Yet walking away from the Club-centric nature of our 
				organization if not done carefully could be our demise.<br>
				<br>
				I strongly support the notion of RI focusing on a few issues and 
				staying with them &amp; yet I recognize that with 1.2 + million 
				members – we are going to have a diversity of interests &amp; that 
				we must let Rotarians and Rotary clubs pursue their interests – 
				that has been and is our strength.<br>
				<br>
				I appreciate that the senior Rotary leadership, especially the 
				Board has to ensure the integrity of the organization and our 
				brand. Yet, there is a danger that the senior leaders and worse, 
				the staff in Evanston want to direct what Rotarians do – that 
				would be very unhealthy.<br>
				<br>
				The world is changing and Rotary has to chance with it. 
				Fellowships have only been around for little more than 50 years. 
				They have changed over the years – and have been a dynamic 
				element of Rotary as Rotarians respond to the times. <br>
				<br>
				But back to the Yin and Yang – Fellowship and Service fit 
				together like a warm handshake, I am not sure we should separate 
				them. So if given an option of continuing as a Fellowship or 
				opting to become a new entity as you have proposed – I am not 
				sure – the latter would be clearer and more manageable 
				especially if clubs and districts could join directly – but I 
				like the focus on fellowship too.<br>
				<br>
				This was a rather long-winded response to your paper. However I 
				do think that these are matters that deserve very thoughtful 
				consideration.<br>
				<br>
				I would welcome an opportunity to participate in an exchange of 
				ideas, concerns and options between leaders from within the 
				Fellowships – both kinds and senior Rotary leaders (not 
				staffers) to discuss the range of issues that your paper begins 
				to address.<br>
				<br>
				It might be worth the cost to organize a working session – in 
				Evanston – perhaps sometime after the next board meeting to have 
				an in-depth discussion of these issues.<br>

				<br>
				Subject : Your RRSA proposal <br>
				<br>
				I read your memo about your proposal of a Rotary Register 
				Service Affiliates (RRSA) and I humbly want to share with you 
				few thoughts I had in reading your proposal. <br>
				<br>
				First I must admit that I am not a member of any Fellowship 
				groups except ROTI which in my knowledge is simply a Internet 
				forum for Rotarians. I never participate in any other 
				fellowships which, as you mentionned, are raising money for 
				their cause. However I can understand the concern that some RI 
				officials could have about that situation.<br>
				<br>
				I recently discovered that many other organisations outside the 
				Fellowships does not have the official recognition by RI. The 
				Rotary Leadership Institue is a good example of those 
				organisations. They work with Rotarians to develop Rotary 
				knowledge to club members. They are not recognized by RI even if 
				they work for the benefit of Rotary clubs. Such an organisation 
				is very useful and I can see the positive effects on some clubs 
				members who attend their sessions since our district is a member 
				of RLI. <br>
				<br>
				Because they are not officially recognized, it is more difficult 
				for them to expand in the Rotary world even if their work is 
				helping Rotarians to have a better knowledge of the Rotary 
				organisation and its programs, which should have a very positive 
				effects on the development of Rotary. This absence of 
				recognition under an official umbrella certainely hurts other 
				groups which are very useful and are playing an important role 
				in the life or Rotarians. As an example you mentionned the WCS 
				Ressource Network which has been dismantled when its request to 
				be recognized as an official fellowship has been refused. I can 
				also mentionned ICC which is recognized in the MOP but has no 
				means to have an official structure in the the Rotary World. <br>
				<br>
				That’s why I would suggest to extend your proposal to all other 
				“unstructured” or “unrecognized” organisations thats exists in 
				the Rotary world and not only organisations focused on service. 
				With the new means of communications we can expect that in the 
				future individuals or regional initiatives will be rapidly known 
				in the Rotary world and RI will have a hard time trying to 
				control those initiatives which would probably take the name 
				Rotary in their own name. We can also think that creating an 
				umbrella such as RRSA will also help those organisations to be 
				better structured because they will find a minimun of rules and 
				guidelines to rely on.<br>
				<br>
				Because RRSA in my opinion shall regroup all unofficial 
				organisations, the rules about the vendor license should be 
				better defined and not be applicable to organisations which are 
				only raising money for administrative puposes (suggested rule no 
				6). Some categories could be made such as groups authorised to 
				raise money for their cause and those authorised only to raise 
				money such as dues for adminsitrative puposes. <br>
				<br>
				In fact I would prefer a name with a wider scope to include not 
				only “Service” organisations but all structured groups such as 
				The Rotary Leadership Institute, the ICC etc... A name such as 
				Registered Rotary Affiliated Group (RRAG) or Registered Rotary 
				Partner Group or any other name with a larger scope which could 
				include any group would be more meaningful to me. <br>
				<br>
				I am not a lawyer but I can tell you that I feel, but for 
				different reasons, that an umbrella structure is actually needed 
				for all the actual and futur groups that wants to work to 
				develop the Rotary organisation and work accordingly under the 
				Rotary principles of Service. Actually the absence of an 
				official umbrella structure is a lack which refrain many groups 
				to be better structured and to be more efficient in this Rotary 
				World. In its second century, Rotary should be able to receive 
				and host any group of dedicated Rotarians who wants to develop 
				and structure a niche of service which is not actually the case. 
				As Rotary International is seeking for new members we should be 
				able to acomodate those who actually would like to find a niche 
				where they will be able to perfom service to others in the way 
				they feel they would be more useful. Actualy each time a group 
				is getting organised outside the officially recognised entities, 
				the actual rules are placing them in an unconfortable situation. 
				This situation limit their expansion and at the same time the 
				service they could provide to Rotarians or simply limit the 
				service to people who would have need them the most.<br>
				<br>
				To avoid the multiplication and duplication of organisations, a 
				certain amount of rules would have to be defined. To be accepted 
				under this umbrella each organisation would have to receive the 
				Board appoval prior to be accepted under the umbrella. <br>
				<br>
				It is my humble opinion. I am not very knowledgeable about all 
				the legal or organisational implications of the actual situation 
				but your proposal appears to me to be a fair answer to the lack 
				I had already felt by being involved in organisations such as 
				the Rotary Leadership Institute and the Inter Country Committee. 
				I salute your initiative and I wish your proposal will be the 
				answer to ther inconfortable situation you described. <br>

				Ref: the paper circulated by RID John Eberhard dated November 
				13, 2004 on the proposal for a new entity of Rotary to be called 
				“Rotary Registered Service Affiliate” (RRSA).<br>
				<br>
				1. The paper presents serious attention toward a complex and 
				evolving activity of Rotarians. It addresses the assets and 
				liabilities of, and the related benefits and risks to Rotary 
				from “cause-related” fellowships.<br>
				<br>
				2. The work of the Rotarians involved in these fellowships has 
				without exception been inspired by the defining themes of 
				Rotary: service and helping others. In most cases, the work of 
				the Rotarians in these fellowships has expanded beyond the 
				ability of the current Rotary structure (clubs, districts, RI 
				committees, etc) to support their aspirations. So, they have 
				employed entrepreneurial, creative solutions. They have explored 
				new structures and systems of how Rotarians can associate and 
				accomplish their work. Since these groups usually have more 
				consistent leadership than the normal one-year turnover of 
				leadership in Rotary, they sustain more intense, more 
				effectively and more durable attention toward their areas of 
				interest than a club might be able to do. They challenge the 
				official Rotary structure on priorities and relative importance 
				of their causes, giving concern to the Board and the TRF 
				Trustees. <br>
				<br>
				3. Since these activities have been grass root movements, they 
				have had to deal with corporate and status quo forces to 
				establish and maintain their existence. In Darwinian terms, they 
				are survivors, which stimulates and in part justifies their 
				existence. They each have a mission, which they adamantly guard 
				against predators and adversaries. How Rotary International 
				chooses to categorize them is not so important to them – they 
				see their mission as primary, and want Rotary to embrace the 
				cause as they do. They want to be under the umbrella of Rotary, 
				not outside of it.<br>
				<br>
				4. As Rotary has struggled on how to best “govern” these groups, 
				the groups have occasionally been mistreated, both by individual 
				leaders and by the Board itself. Some have been told by the 
				board: you are a fellowship; then, no, you are not a fellowship, 
				call yourself an initiative; then, you are a fellowship again. 
				And now the Board is thinking of other classifications. This 
				ambivalence on the part of the Board is distracting to the 
				positive work that these groups do, reduces their effectiveness, 
				and leaves those affected by their actions wondering about the 
				wisdom of the Board.<br>
				<br>
				5. There is a concept in most volunteer organizations that the 
				volunteer is a special person, not to be hassled, harassed, 
				pressured, caged or controlled – otherwise they leave and take 
				their energy and work elsewhere. Rotary and its leaders should 
				respect that ideal, or it could lose a foundation of its most 
				loyal workers. <br>
				<br>
				6. Maybe it is characteristic of any Board to want to control 
				and define. Rotary International’s Board wants to set boundaries 
				for these groups, to be comfortable that these groups will not 
				misrepresent or damage Rotary. This role of governance sometimes 
				turns into a jealous eye, as in the donations and grant money 
				they these groups have been able to attract. This is money that 
				RI itself could not attract – or new money. There is also a 
				clear concern of the part of the Board that the efforts of these 
				groups diverts donations and funds from The Rotary Foundation. 
				As major donor to TRF, I challenge that idea. <br>
				<br>
				7. Rotary leadership ought to challenge itself to discover new 
				ways to empower Rotarians to service, not to set up barriers or 
				inhibitors to that service. The idea proposed in the paper of 
				these groups might owe a special dues to RI is contra-productive 
				to that concept. It might make sense to the Board – more revenue 
				- but it is a negative signal to the groups out doing the work. 
				It is a tax for doing good, on those who live off meager dues 
				($10 per year – what will RI have out of that?) and precious 
				donations. It presents an image of a remote group of rulers 
				demanding allegiance in the form of cash. <br>
				<br>
				8. Insurance against risk is another challenge. If Rotary wants 
				to govern and set rules for these groups, then it accepts risks. 
				It can’t control and be legally distant at the same time. The 
				risk of being named in a frivolous law suit is present whether 
				general liability coverage is present or not. A demand of 
				insurance provision could well be the financial burden that 
				would sink most of these groups, especially the smaller ones.

				Draft letter to John Eberhardt from the RFPD Board of Directors<br>
				December 7, 2004<br>
				<br>
				Ref: Eberhardt letter dated November 24, 2004 on Proposal for 
				Rotary Registered Service Agencies (RRSA)<br>
				<br>
				Dear Director John,<br>
				<br>
				The Board of Directors of The Rotarian Fellowship on Population 
				&amp; Development (RFPD) has received your above referenced letter, 
				and has distributed it to our leadership for information and for 
				comment. On the occasion of RFPD’s Board meeting held December 
				6, 2004 in Cairo, Egypt, the Board discussed and evaluated the 
				letter at great length and offers the following for your 
				consideration:<br>
				<br>
				1. We applaud the serious attention that you have given the 
				subject of service-oriented fellowships, such as RFPD and 
				others. We understand that there are important concerns on the 
				part of the Board of Rotary International related to 
				service-oriented fellowships.<br>
				2. We agree that there ought to be a differentiating name for 
				these fellowship, and suggest the name Initiative, which more 
				correctly reflects the purpose and activity of these groups.<br>
				3. We prefer that these service-oriented fellowships be under 
				the umbrella of Rotary International, and be defined as a part 
				of the RI organizational structure.<br>
				4. We are happy with the current method of how Matching Grant 
				projects are administered by The Rotary Foundation (TRF), and 
				see no value in setting up a new method where fellowships can 
				apply directly for Matching Grants from TRF.<br>
				5. We oppose the idea that there should be a dues owed by these 
				fellowships to RI. The Rotarians who compose these fellowships 
				already pay dues to their club, their district, to RI and to the 
				fellowship(s) to which they belong. Significant humanitarian 
				work on a volunteer basis is being provided by these 
				fellowships. To devise another tax for doing humanitarian work 
				makes no sense.<br>
				6. We oppose the suggestion that these groups be required to 
				provide liability insurance to protect RI from potential losses 
				on account of the work they do. Almost all of the work done by 
				service-oriented fellowships is through the Matching Grant 
				methods, administered through clubs and districts, the risks for 
				which would be covered by RI’s current general liability 
				insurance. If there are specific high-risk activities from which 
				RI wishes immunity, stipulate and limits those activities in the 
				rules for the Matching Grant process. TRF has already does that 
				through periodic policy decisions. <br>
				7. We oppose any requirement from RI for fellowships to 
				indemnify Rotary International against any losses for the 
				activities of the fellowship. In business ventures where parties 
				desire “arm’s length” relations, indemnities make sense, when 
				agreeable to both parties. In the case of fellowships where the 
				only serve offered is voluntary, to assert requirement for 
				indemnity breeches trust, becomes an additional financial 
				burden, and threatens continuation of the activity. <br>
				8. We reject the concern that service-oriented fellowships are 
				now usurping or might in the future usurp donations and other 
				funds from TRF. We also disagree that donations of any amount 
				should trigger the need for declaration by the fellowship to RI 
				of such donation or the need for approval from RI. Individuals, 
				businesses and foundations now want to and do give directly to 
				the service-oriented fellowship, so that their funds can be used 
				for the special purposes they may designate that are addressed 
				by the service-oriented fellowship. These same funds would never 
				be given to TRF, since TRF can not assure a donor that the funds 
				would be used only as specifically designated. If special fund 
				accounts (say for example, The RFPD Fund) could be established 
				within TRF for these service-oriented fellowships that could be 
				controlled and used by these fellowships to support their work, 
				then we would reconsider this objection.<br>
				<br>
				Please note the Directors Stan Tempalaars and Solve Kernell were 
				observers at the RFPD Board Meeting mentioned about, and can 
				provide more detail as to the content and spirit of the 
				discussion. We appreciate your commitment to addressing these 
				issues and look forward the Board’s findings.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				For the Board of RFPD<br>

				I like the idea of RRSA. It fills a void. I believe there needs 
				to be rules or policy of how the RRSAs will function. And most 
				import, there needs to be consequences when the rules are not 
				followed. I am not familiar with all the rules regarding 
				Fellowships however looking at the Code of Policy it appears 
				that once they are approved by the RI Board; they never report 
				their activities.<br>
				<br>
				I suggest that RRSAs, Fellowships, and any incorporated 
				organization that have been granted permission to use the Rotary 
				name be governed by a set of rules. I suggest the following:<br>
				<br>
				1. . Submit an Annual Report to the General Secretary with 90 
				days of the end of the Rotary year.<br>
				2. 2. Submit financial statements that have been independently 
				reviewed to the General Secretary<br>
				3. 3. Submit a list of all officers and members<br>
				4. 4. Pay an annual fee to RI - this could be a token amount of 
				say US$1.00 per member.<br>
				5. 5. All members must fill out an application form (paper or 
				on-line) and must pay an annual fee. This will ensure the 
				membership lists are current.<br>
				<br>
				The consequences of not submitting the documents to RI would be 
				that the approval to use the Rotary mark would be withdrawn. 
				Possibly a suspension after 90 days and cancellations of the 
				groups right to be affiliated with Rotary after six months of 
				not filling. These are similar rules to all incorporated 
				Societies in most provinces and states.<br>
				<br>
				I suspect that I am listed as a member of at least one and 
				possibly two fellowships that I never joined. I received two 
				fellowship newsletters. I suspect that at a recent RI Convention 
				I asked questions about the fellowship at a booth and was asked 
				for my business card. This was used to record me as a member.<br>
				<br>
				The RRSA fits what research on Volunteer organizations appears 
				to be seeing as a growing trend. That is greater interest in 
				specific short-term periods of volunteer service. People want to 
				volunteer for a cause for a year or two and then move onto to 
				another cause. The RRSA and Fellowships fill this need. Rotary 
				club membership asks for lifetime commitment for a board range 
				of causes and ideas.<br>
				<br>
				There are a lot of Incorporated ‘Rotary’ societies out there and 
				‘Rotary’ Foundations. Some use the world Rotary in their title 
				others do not. I have been involved in several. The Sandover-Sly 
				Memorial Foundation is an incorporated BC Society and Registered 
				Federal Charity. It has about C$125,000.00 invested. The 
				interest from the investment supports youth exchange students in 
				D5040 and 5050. All the directors are Rotarians.<br>
				<br>
				The Rotary World Help Network is a multi-club 
				humanitarian-shipping project in D5040 and 5050. It is an 
				incorporated BC Society and registered Federal Charity. This 
				group obtained formal approval from RI to use the word ‘Rotary’ 
				in its name and constitution. But since incorporating has never 
				had to file a report with RI. We have amended the constitution 
				formally with the province of BC but are not required to tell 
				RI. The group this year will ship 25 - 40 foot sea containers of 
				used hospital and educational equipment around the world.<br>
				<br>
				You and I know from our professional background that rules that 
				are not enforce are of little value. Passing a rule with get 
				most people to following it. But as time goes by and people see 
				that there are no consequences to ignoring the rules, more 
				people disregard the rule. I suggest this is why so many 
				Fellowships are doing what they want rather than what Rotary 
				wants. There are no consequences when the rules are not 
				followed.<br>
				<br>
				I submit Rotary goes even farther and rewards Rotarians who do 
				not follow the rules. They are thinking out of the box and are 
				creative. Take the case of one-day district conference. Rotary 
				staff know when the date is sent in that the conference cannot 
				meet the requirements for Rotary content. However, an RI 
				President’s Rep is sent giving credibility to the conference.<br>

				Many PDGs that are involved in the various ‘unofficial’ 
				Fellowships or Fellowships who are doing their own thing are 
				rewarded with RI or zone appointments. If a person who in debt 
				to RI is disqualified from holding RI appointments should not 
				someone who ignores the rules after being cautioned?<br>
				<br>
				A long diatribe but the bottom line is the RRSA is a good idea 
				if it has clear policies attached to it and the rules are 
				enforced. Not rigid draconian enforcement but enforced so that 
				people know they must be followed.<br>

				Dear John<br>
				<br>
				I believe that Rotary International is much more varied than its 
				official programs. Therefore it would be nice to use the web 
				site to promote those activities, that, while not within RI 
				programs, are the most important, in some cases involving 
				several zones. <br>
				<br>
				That being said, as far as Fellowships are concerned, it seems 
				to me that some official fellowships are much more than simple 
				fellowships, by the scope of their activities and the funds 
				involved (for instance, those dealing with AIDS, Population &amp; 
				Development, Preventable blindness...).<br>
				<br>
				I believe that we should think about giving them a more 
				permanent official status within Rotary, particularly since 
				other such groups might be created in other areas. <br>
				<br>
				But, coming back to your project: <br>
				<br>
				I think that the formula that we talked about during the 
				Diplomatic Corps reception in Chicago might work.<br>
				- At the center, we have the clubs and districts. We cannot do 
				much there. <br>
				- We can very well institute a 2nd tier, constituted with 
				official RI associations and organizations. Our fellowships 
				would be at that level. We could also include the Tasks force 
				nominated by the RI President. <br>
				- On the 3rd level, we would have associations and organizations 
				dealing with our optional programs. <br>
				<br>
				The Strategic Plan could define our official programs, while the 
				recommended activities would be optional. <br>
				<br>
				In such as scenario, what would be the relationship of RI with 
				those groups? <br>
				<br>
				- For the groups within RI official programs, RI must rely on 
				them, and while coming up with rules of procedure, RI should 
				grant them as much freedom and power of decision as possible. 
				This point is very important.<br>
				- Those fellowships not within recommended activities would 
				remain as Rotary Fellowships as they are today. <br>
				<br>
				Those are just a few thoughts. Please don't hesitate to ask if I 
				am not clear enough. Thanks for working so hard on this topic of 
				great importance for Rotary. <br>
				<br>
				Yours in Rotary,<br>

				Mark, RID John has prepared a thoughtful and, if I may say so, 
				very<br>
				exciting, new avenue for outreach to the present &quot;marginal&quot; 
				activities of<br>
				Rotarians. I say marginal because that is where the Rotary 
				Fellowships<br>
				have always been placed, in limbo. Are they really part of 
				Rotary or not?<br>
				I would endorse this concept as the natural extension of the 
				Fellowship<br>
				program, for the expansion of the concept of Rotarian service 
				and as a<br>
				membership enhancing initiative. <br>

				<br>
				John – The attachment to your first e-mail came through OK at my 
				address. Thank you so much for including me in your feedback 
				loop. Last October, 2003, if the General Secretary, had asked 
				for feedback on his WCSRN proposal to the Board, we would never 
				have had the fiasco that we are having with the merger of the 
				WCSRN into the HSRF. There is still virtually nothing happening 
				and what little has been structured into the HSRF Web Site has 
				only a fraction of the functionality of the former WCSRN site 
				(now Hands Across the Sea) so we continue to maintain the HANDS 
				site and if the HRSF ever does get serious about the merger, at 
				least they can merge complete and up to date modules. Now onto 
				my comments:<br>
				<br>
				1. Registered Rotary Service Affiliate. I wholeheartedly agree 
				that we need the “Registered Rotary Service Affiliate” 
				structure. You will remember, last in October and November, 
				2003, I and others had communicated extensively about the 
				inapplicability of the Fellowship structure to the WCSRN. I 
				think the “Rotary Service Affiliate” is a great idea. I am not 
				sure that you need the term “Registered” in the title but you 
				may have a good reason for using it. <br>
				<br>
				2. Club/District Programs (Your P1, Paragraph 2) – I know you 
				are aware of some “Country-wide” Projects as well as the Club 
				and District sponsored projects but you may not realize how many 
				there are. Please see the Projects Directory, On-Going Projects 
				Index on the HANDS Web Site. We have indexed some known 95 
				projects, many of which embody efforts from more than a club or 
				district. Your 2nd Paragraph also mentions “International 
				Service Project” or “WCS Project”. I personally think we should 
				consider WCS, 3H Grants, MG as well as Disaster Relief projects 
				as all “International Service Projects”. If not, what are they? 
				I would suggest the paragraph state “…forth Avenue of Service as 
				an International Service Projects, including WCS Projects, TRF 
				Grant Projects and Disaster Relief”. <br>
				<br>
				3. Fellowship Groups (Your P2, Paragraphs 2 &amp; 3) – You are 
				absolutely right, these “service oriented” programs are not 
				Fellowships. Fellowship will most certainly evolve from the 
				service activity, but they were not organized to provide 
				“fellowship” among the member Rotarians. In addition, I think it 
				was a mistake when the Board, some years ago, merged the former 
				“Vocational Contact Groups” into the Fellowship program. I think 
				Rotarians join these groups not with the intent of providing 
				fellowship but literally to make vocational contacts. Everything 
				we do in Rotary eventually results in fellowship but the name 
				should be more mission directed than to lump them all together 
				as “Fellowships” <br>
				<br>
				4. Rotary Service Affiliates in relation to the RI/TRF Staff 
				Structure ( Page3, Paragraphs 3-5) – In at least three 
				successive Rotary Institutes in Anaheim, during the General 
				Secretaries presentation, I have appealed for more RI/TRF Staff 
				use of volunteers. Staff virtually always says “No” to our 
				requests for expanded service on the basis of limited funding 
				and staff and yet, we have thousands of Rotarians who can assist 
				staff with specific defined functions and thereby expand the 
				capability of Rotary in total. Ed’s answer has always been “we 
				don’t train our staff to work with volunteers very effectively”. 
				Every Registered Rotary Service Affiliate should be directly 
				integrated with specific staff members and the staff should be 
				instructed to utilize the resources of the Affiliate. Obviously, 
				this will require some expenditure of time on the part of staff, 
				but we should realize the increased project productivity that 
				would result, as well as the improved input to staff from the 
				“grass roots” regarding changes in program, etc. <br>
				<br>
				5. Fund Raising (Page 2, Paragraph 6) – I do not believe that 
				Fellowships or Rotary Service Affiliates should be permitted to 
				do fund raising above the amount needed for the administration 
				of the group itself. Perhaps you can consider setting an amount 
				per member to cover overhead, that would automatically balance 
				the large and small fellowships. When the Affiliate files their 
				annual report to RI, they could be required to donate any 
				surplus to TRF. In addition, I do not feel that a RRSA should 
				charge its members dues. Why should we pay, above the general 
				dues, to do the mission of Rotary? The annual administrative 
				budgets of the RRSAs should be supported by voluntary 
				contributions. <br>
				<br>
				6. WCSRN Was not a Disbandment (Page 4, Paragraph 1, after 
				partial) – The WCSRN was not disbanded, the General Secretaries 
				letter of 6 October 2003 directed that the name be changed and 
				certain other changes be made. As a result of the Board’s 
				decision, The Humanitarian Service Resource Fellowship (HSRF) 
				was created with the intention of merging the WCSRN into the 
				HSRF. Unfortunately this has not happened and in July, 2004 I 
				announced that the WCSRN would re-start the maintenance of the 
				WCSRN Web Site and on 27 August 2004 we posted the first update 
				since May. The logic was that since the HSRF Web Site was 
				started with the May, 2004 data from the WCSRN and not 
				thereafter maintained, the maintenance of the WCSRN Site would 
				permit the HSRF, at such date they desired, to merge more 
				complete and updated modules. Nothing has happened since then 
				and the WCSRN has now changed its address to HANDS Across the 
				Sea to comply with the October, 2003 decision. <br>
				<br>
				As a side note – We were never permitted to see the General 
				Secretary’s report to the Board, but we were advised that the 
				change was required because the name WCSRN was being confused 
				with the official Rotary program, WCS. In the 7 years since 
				Cliff Dochterman conceived of the WCSRN, which was approved by 
				the RI Board. with two successive encouragement resolutions, we 
				were never aware of any confusion and if there was confusion, 
				why didn’t RI simply change the definition they wrote and 
				published on the RI Web Site to clarify the confusion.<br>
				<br>
				7. Consultation with Effected Groups (Page 4, Paragraph 2) – I 
				agree with you 100%. Had this been done in October, we would not 
				have had the WCSRN/HSRF fiasco that ensued and it still has not 
				been resolved. <br>
				<br>
				8. The Issues, Page 4, Paragraph 3) – I do not fully understand 
				all of the ramifications of the seven items you list, but I do 
				not understand why it is desirable to get the name of ROTARY out 
				of our collective efforts. Have we discarded the PR program? As 
				to Risk Management, it seems to me that RI will be sued anytime 
				a law suite against any facet of the Rotary or Rotarian 
				structure. Some years ago, Fellowships were directed to rename 
				themselves “…of Rotarians”, taking Rotary out of their name and 
				I think that was for legal purposes. We should insure RI to 
				cover all of the contingent risks, RI, TRF, Club, District, 
				Fellowships and Affiliates. As to HANDS, we, unlike many of the 
				other service oriented fellowships, do not conduct projects, so 
				our exposure would probably be minimal. We are merely an 
				“information resource”. From reading the mission of the HSRF, 
				there is an implication that the HSRF will actually do projects, 
				which would obviously have more exposure. <br>
				<br>
				9. Fellowship Groups (Page 5, Paragraph 3) – I think you should 
				also have the Hands Across the Sea program in your list because 
				until it is ultimately merged into the HSRF, it will continue to 
				be updated and operated. The HSRF Web Site has only about 10% of 
				the content of the HANDS Web Site, and the data is the 5/04 
				edition of the HANDS Site, whereas the HANDS site is kept up to 
				date. I realize that your paragraph related to Fellowship Groups 
				but I think your concept applies to all Rotary cause-related 
				programs. <br>
				<br>
				10. Non-Club Organizations (Page 5, Paragraph 4) – Perhaps this 
				is where the HANDS program should be listed and I again refer 
				you to the 95 projects as mentioned in paragraph 2 above. <br>
				<br>
				11. Risk Management, Page 6, Paragraph 4 – I think the RI 
				Liability Policy should cover all Rotary registered activities.
				<br>
				<br>
				12. The Solution, Page 8, Paragraph (2) – I don’t think that a 
				Fellowship or Affiliate should be required to pay dues to RI. 
				They were created to support the objectives of Rotary and should 
				not have to pay for that “privilege”. <br>
				<br>
				John – I sincerely appreciate your request for input. Somehow we 
				have got to get this same attitude implemented by the RI/TRF 
				staff.<br>

				<br>
				November 22, 2004<br>
				<br>
				Greetings all,<br>
				<br>
				I apologize in advance if you have already received this. I am 
				informed that my emails in early November were not picking up 
				attachments and as a result the draft submission proposal was 
				probably NOT attached to my earlier note to you. If you have 
				already received this, please accept my apology for cluttering 
				up your system. If not, I would be grateful for your feedback.<br>
				<br>
				Attached below is my earlier email.<br>
				<br>
				John<br>
				<br>
				Your Proposal for “Registered Rotary Service Affiliates – 
				(RRSA)” sent Nov 18, 2004 <br>
				<br>
				Dear Director John,<br>
				<br>
				The Board of Directors of The Rotarian Fellowship on Population 
				&amp; Development (RFPD) has received your above referenced letter, 
				and has distributed it to our leadership for information and for 
				comment. On the occasion of RFPD’s Board meeting held December 
				6, 2004 in Cairo, Egypt, and during the last weeks the Board 
				discussed and evaluated the letter at great length and offers 
				the following detailed comments for your consideration:<br>
				<br>
				I. We applaud the serious attention that you have given the 
				subject of service-oriented fellowships, such as RFPD and 
				others. <br>
				II. We agree with you fully that Rotary has to improve in 
				planning, conceiving, implementing, evaluating and reporting on 
				their WCS-projects. Apart from PolioPlus and maybe a few pilot 
				projects / 3-H projects our traditional club-to-club WCS 
				compares badly with the international development aid projects 
				of other big NGOs. Rotary’s reputation may depend on improving 
				our WCS systems. <br>
				III. We presume this is the main reason that Rotary hardly gets 
				funds from other sources whilst other NGOs do for many years. 
				That hampers our WCS whilst on the other hand Rotary as (one of) 
				the largest volunteer organization with its unique global 
				network could utilize such funds often better than other 
				organizations. <br>
				IV. RFPD exclusively initiates, supports and co-funds projects 
				of clubs or districts. RFPD is not attracting funds that would 
				go to TRF. Clubs receive funds as do districts. They do not need 
				to report to RI or ask for approval why should RFPD be expected 
				to do this? Our sections are cooperating with Regional Rotary 
				Foundation Coordinators; the coordinator of zone 14 is a member 
				of the board of our German section. Individuals, businesses and 
				foundations now want to and do give directly to the 
				service-oriented fellowship, so that their funds can be used for 
				the special purposes they may designate, that are addressed by 
				the service-oriented fellowships. These same funds would never 
				be given to TRF, since TRF can not assure a donor that the funds 
				would be used only as specifically as designated. If special 
				fund accounts (say for example, The RFPD Fund) could be 
				established within TRF for these service-oriented fellowships 
				that could be controlled and used by these fellowships to 
				support their work it may be possible for TRF to handle these 
				funds. The grant we received from Packard Foundation for the 3-H 
				Nigeria project of districts 1840 and 9120 is carried out by 
				RDG, the German TRF-branch. <br>
				V. RFPD maintains the tradition of club-to-club (or 
				district-to-district) projects. At the same time, RFPD gets 
				funds from other sources for club projects.<br>
				<br>
				VI. We do not see the necessity to depart from the tradition 
				that Rotary Service is a function and responsibility of the 
				Rotary Club. We even see the danger that our clubs would push 
				WCS into the background as some already tend to do. Clubs should 
				be encouraged and supported in their WCS activities.<br>
				VII. As Rotary’s goal Peace and World Understanding is getting 
				more important and as we promote it best with WCS our overall 
				goal should be to strengthen and to improve WCS and to make 
				Rotary competitive in getting funds from outside. <br>
				VIII. Service related fellowships have proven that they can 
				substantially contribute to WCS. Every counterproductive 
				interference or bureaucracy which could weaken them should be 
				avoided. Members of service fellowships are highly motivated as 
				they work in decentralized units which of course accept an 
				overall control by RI. This is how international organizations 
				and even companies work successfully: by decentralization / 
				delegation and by overall not detailed control. This might apply 
				even more for a volunteer organization. RFPD as an active 
				volunteer organization wants to work under the umbrella of RI, 
				as you rightly state. <br>
				IX. RFPD sticks to the rules of a RI fellowship. Its Board of 
				Directors keeps close contact with the RI Directors of the zones 
				to which they belong. We plan to have an Advisory Board of Past 
				RI Directors to be able to maintain even greater vigilance. Our 
				largest section in Germany has a board of directors to whom the 
				chairman of the German Governors council, a multidistrict 
				organization, belongs. <br>
				X. In conclusion we feel that you raise basic questions which 
				are linked with each other and which are not just a problem of 
				the service fellowships. Such questions would not be solved by 
				giving these fellowships a new “legal” status like RRSA. This 
				complex problem should be studied in the holistic context of our 
				movement and intensively without time pressure. <br>
				<br>
				Following our comments to the items of your paragraph “The 
				Solution”: <br>
				<br>
				9. Whilst we do not see any difficulty in continuing with 
				service related fellowships in case RI feels that there ought to 
				be a differentiating name for these fellowships, we suggest the 
				name Initiative, which correctly reflects the purpose and 
				activity of these groups. In any case these service-oriented 
				fellowships should be under the umbrella of Rotary 
				International, and be defined as a part of the RI organizational 
				structure.<br>
				10. We strongly oppose the idea that there should be dues owed 
				by these fellowships to RI. The Rotarians who compose these 
				fellowships already pay dues to their club, their district, to 
				RI and to the fellowship(s) to which they belong. Significant 
				humanitarian work on a volunteer basis is being provided by 
				these fellowships. To devise a tax for doing humanitarian work 
				makes no apparent sense.<br>
				11. The suggestion that these groups be required to provide 
				liability insurance to protect RI from potential losses on 
				account of the work they do seems unnecessary. All of the work 
				done by RFPD is through clubs and districts or through the 
				Matching Grants, administered through clubs and districts, the 
				risks for which would be covered by RI’s current general 
				liability insurance. If there are specific high-risk activities 
				from which RI wishes immunity, stipulate and limit those 
				activities in the rules for the Matching Grant process. TRF 
				already does that through periodic policy decisions.<br>
				12. The request that service related fellowships (or RRSA) would 
				provide a hold-harmless statement and agreement for indemnity of 
				RI for any legal action in which RI was included does not apply 
				as RFPD does not implement any projects itself but only through 
				clubs and districts.<br>
				13. Membership should remain as presently regulated in the RI 
				Code of Policies.<br>
				14. Service fellowships should in this regard be treated as a 
				club as if at all they would distribute or sell such material 
				they would exclusively do it to support club activities.<br>
				15. We are happy with the way Matching Grant projects are now 
				administered by The Rotary Foundation (TRF), and see no purpose 
				in setting up a new method where fellowships can apply directly 
				for Matching Grants from TRF.<br>
				16. See our comment under 7. <br>
				17. RFPD always seeks the support of the Governors and is not 
				aware of any problems which Governors would have seen from 
				fellowship activities. Governors are happy to see that RFPD 
				supports their clubs. Clubs and districts are inviting RFPD 
				officers for speeches on the service opportunity “Population 
				Issues” which are mentioned in the “RI Menu of Service 
				Opportunities” and based on the corresponding resolution of CoL 
				1998. RI could restrict their approvals of service fellowships 
				to those promoting a service of this menu. RFPD is not 
				affiliated with “like minded government or NGO affiliates”. <br>
				18. RFPD never intended this or would intend that.<br>
				19. -13. As so far.<br>
				14. Could be done by service fellowships as long as RI staff 
				does not interfere.<br>
				15. As so far.<br>
				16. Given time, RFPD would comply.<br>
				<br>
				Please note the Directors Stan Tempelaars and Solve Kernell were 
				observers at the RFPD Board Meeting mentioned above, and can 
				provide more details as to the content and spirit of the 
				discussion. Finally we would like to refer to the letter RFPD 
				sent you on June 1, 2004.<br>
				<br>
				We appreciate your vision and commitment in addressing these 
				issues. We request they should be studied further before 
				arriving at decisions. <br>

				Hi RID John:<br>
				<br>
				You put alot of work into this proposal, and my comments to it 
				are short, because I support it in its entirety.<br>
				<br>
				I would that Rotary be inclusive rather than exclusive.<br>
				Just as RI has moved to include Fellowships that seem to be more 
				service oriented (though Fellowship abounds), you have preserved 
				order in the organization, and Rotary will grow because of it.. 
				It would appear you can do the same with the RRSA's by a least 
				keeping a hand to them.<br>
				RRSA's and Fellowships need to be accountable to RI, and 
				possibly some of the admininstrative and liability costs of RI 
				to govern them needs to be borne by the Groups. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Hope this helps.<br>
				<br>
				Monty<br>

				Pietro Freschi<br>
				<br>
				Thanks for your proposal.<br>
				I do not know which will be the impact with the new wave to 
				restrict the control of the Rotary activity from the center.<br>
				What you are proposing is just in the opposite direction, but I 
				agree with you it will semplify the day by day life of the 
				fellowship.<br>
				What are the comments from the others ?<br>
				Regards<br>

				Dear John:<br>
				<br>
				Thanks for your letter…I have been thinking about this same 
				subject for some time. It is time that we look at the overall 
				structure of our organization and recognize that we have grown, 
				certainly since the Fellowship principal was originated. We have 
				more members and more service minded Rotarians who are 
				passionate about SERVICE, not just fellowship.<br>
				<br>
				You have addressed the concerns and made a good case for change, 
				but I fear that my advisory committee of the Humanitarian 
				Service Resource Fellowship may not truly understand how we fit 
				in the picture. Therefore, if I may ask a special favor, can you 
				briefly explain to me so that I may share with our Board and 
				Advisory Committee how we will fit into the picture you paint? 
				We are just getting it going great and to move us off track 
				would seriously affect our committed members.<br>
				<br>
				From what I read in your attachment, we should be progressive…I 
				think a simpler name should be considered….something like 
				“Rotary Service Fellowship” for this new structure you suggest.<br>
				<br>
				Thanks for your sharing this important discussion with us, we 
				should like to make substantive comments and suggestions.<br>
				<br>
				All the best,<br>
				<br>
				Sonny<br>
				<br>
				Dear Colleagues:<br>
				<br>
				We are off and running quite well as a new Humanitarian Service 
				Resource Fellowship, recommended by the Board. John Eberhard, a 
				great friend of the WCSRN and its successor HSRF. He has been 
				charged with recommending to the RI Board some changes to the 
				Fellowship area.<br>
				<br>
				I know that I ask a great deal of you, dear friends, but we do 
				need your input, so I ask if you would read through the full 
				email below.<br>
				<br>
				Perhaps you can start at the bottom of this email and work up to 
				Elliot Lowenstein’s response ( Elliot is the Treasurer of the 
				HSRF). Would you then please provide us with your thoughts? John 
				Eberhard is on the mailing list so your response to all will be 
				helpful.<br>
				<br>
				At this time for Thanksgiving, I thank you for being of special 
				assistance in the further development of what we envision as a 
				greatly expanded opportunity to serve.<br>
				<br>
				The best!<br>
				<br>
				Sonny<br>
				<br>
				PRID William Gant<br>
				<br>
				Since Charlie knows RID Sushi, I recommend that he (utilizing 
				whatever contact he has with Sonny in doing so, pursue details 
				of John's proposal with RID Sushi and, subsequently, with 
				whomever drafts the final Board decision, to determine exactly 
				what the HSF can do to provide leadership which will enhance, 
				promote, and authorize RRSAs and their proper roles in Rotary 
				activities and growth.<br>
				<br>
				Since the largest concern and biggest objections appear to have 
				been expresses by staff, I recommend that the GS be asked to 
				review and comment on John's proposal (including whatever is 
				deemed to be appropriate comment by TRF leadership about TRF 
				being compelled to utilize &quot;RBM&quot;)<br>

				Dear RID John,<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				I am responding as Chair of the Environment Fellowship of 
				Rotarians (Rotary Fellowship of Environment). I had also founded 
				and applied to RI for the recognition of the United Nations 
				Fellowship of Rotarians. I thus feel that I understand 
				particularly well the usefulness of your efforts and do thank 
				you for them.<br>
				<br>
				It's a pleasure to thus support your efforts by sharing with you 
				my comments on the conceptual proposal, as well as on the 
				functional details.<br>
				<br>
				Before I had a chance to receive and to read your document and 
				below message, I expressed my opinion in the brief message 
				quoted below, following the good news of the recent meeting 
				between the President of RI and the Dir. Gen. of UNESCO.<br>
				<br>
				Prior to the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) held 
				in Johannesburg, our Environment Fellowship was in contact with 
				the office<br>
				<br>
				of the President of RI and we did submit our input for the RI 
				participation lead by our member PRID Tony Serrano who was the 
				right Rotarian at the right place and did a great job. 
				Similarly, with important United Nations' and other important 
				conferences, activities, efforts for sustainable development, 
				etc. etc.continually taking place around the world, since Rotary 
				has of the best volunteers with the needed experience and 
				expertise, we are fortunate that most likely everywhere we'll 
				find the right Rotarian to competently and well represent RI 
				there. This does maximize the quality of the Rotary contribution 
				and does minimize the cost to Rotary.<br>
				<br>
				Because among Rotarians in general and the Rotary Fellowship 
				members in particular there are all over the world highly 
				experienced top quality specialists and experts in all fields 
				willing to volunteer their services for humankind in rotarian 
				spirit, with some coordination to allow them to do so, Rotary 
				has a huge potential to achieve a multiple<br>
				of PolioPlus for nearly no cost in comparison. This is in 
				particular true also in really wisely making the best of all the 
				great opportunities which its consultative status with the 
				United Nations offers to RI.<br>
				<br>
				RRSAs appear to be a most promising concept ! RRSAs have the 
				great potential to make it possible for Rotary to always better 
				making the best of all the excellent opportunities available to 
				Rotary to always better serve humankind globally, and at the 
				same time for Rotarians to enjoy the fellowship in and through 
				Rotary ever more.<br>
				<br>
				As we consider the RRSAs, it is of value to consider the case of 
				the proposed UN Fellowship of Rotarians (UNFR). Since the 
				purpose of the committee of RI is so limited and different from 
				that of the UNFR, it is surprising that the decision to reject 
				the<br>
				UNFR was, as you mention, that &quot;the United Nations Fellowship of 
				Rotarians has been rejected because 'Rotary already has a 
				committee that is directly connected to the UN'&quot;.<br>
				If those who rejected the UNFR had really known sifficiently 
				about the United Nations and would have informed themselves 
				about the task of the RI committee in comparison of those of the 
				proposed UNFR, they would never have rejected the UNFR with such 
				a superficial judgment 'on the theory that Rotary already has a 
				committee that is directly<br>
				connected to the UN', as you write. To this quoted statement I 
				wish to comment that this reasoning would be fully justified if 
				that 'committee that is directly connected to the<br>
				UN' would really fulfill its full potential and make the best of 
				what the UN offers to Rotary, thus finally stopping missing 
				opportunities for Rotary rather than making the best of them! 
				..but it not even has the explicit mandate to do so. We have 
				noted<br>
				that, although far from sufficient, recently there has been a 
				badly needed renewal of this committee's chair and members, but 
				RI goes on to sadly continually miss so many great opportunities 
				globally which the consultative status of RI to the UN does give 
				us: opportunities for Rotary to serve humankind at nearly no 
				cost to RI. This renewal of<br>
				membership is promising, but it is really far from sufficient 
				for that committee to be able to start to cope with the huge 
				opportunities available to Rotary through the United Nations. 
				This is most unfortunate because, through its 1.2 million 
				membership, Rotary has the best selection of experts in all 
				fields who, if given a chance, would volunteer their time for 
				humankind where the need is greatest ! Because of this, as an 
				important member of Civil Society, Rotary has a moral duty not 
				to continue wasting most of the many opportunities constantly 
				offered by the UN !<br>
				<br>
				But, it really appears that the membership of the 
				above-mentioned '...committee that is directly connected to the 
				UN' of RI is still far too small and the individuals are really 
				far too busy to be able to dedicate themselves sufficiently well 
				to their so limited duties, and are unable to make the best of 
				the unique global opportunities the UN offers to Rotary. Among 
				Rotarians there are globally so many top quality specialists 
				andexperts who'd love to contribute their expertise, but, sadly, 
				probably also because now in RI, besides yourself, there are too 
				few who really understand the UN, its potential and had 
				experience in it, RI is not yet able to be giving them this 
				opportunity. <br>
				Because the above-mentioned RI committee is barely able to carry 
				out its so limited task, it would be necessary for the UN 
				Fellowship of Rotarians to be recognized and able to function, 
				possibly, hopefully soon, as a RRSA, also especially making the 
				best in using Rotarians' expertise and good will towards 
				sustainable development in achieving<br>
				the United Nations Millennium Goals. Thus, unless and until that 
				RI committee is really given the needed additional tasks, 
				strengthened sufficiently and acquires the necessary<br>
				commitment and vision, there is urgent need for a United Nations 
				RRSA.<br>
				If RI wishes to continue to rely on the 'RI Representatives to 
				the United Nations and Other Organizations' for fulfilling all 
				of Rotary's full potential in relation to the UN, then it is 
				imperative that the tasks of this committee be redefined 
				extending them<br>
				sufficiently ! For the time being their task is to enhance 
				Rotary's visibility, as well as monitor and provide very limited 
				information. While this is useful for Rotary's visibility, what 
				is really needed for Rotary to have better quality fellowship 
				and best serve humankind through the UN was well defined in the 
				scope, object and proposed<br>
				activities of the United Nations Fellowship of Rotarians. It is 
				thus most unfortunate that those who did choose to reject the 
				proposed United Nations Fellowship of Rotarians did not realize 
				the huge difference between the existing small RI committee 
				concerned with<br>
				Rotary's visibility, and the totally different, most needed, 
				constructive, active purpose of the UN fellowship of Rotarians !<br>
				<br>
				Since RI refused to accept the proposed United Nations 
				Fellowship of Rotarians because, as you explain, 'Rotary already 
				has a committee that is directly connected to the UN' and thus, 
				logically, RI wishes for its RI Representatives to the UN and 
				Other Organizations (p.O42 of the current RI Official Directory) 
				to really do that job of the<br>
				proposed UNFR, then RI must adapt and enlarge the tasks and 
				strength of that committee making it also responsible for the 
				action the United Nations Fellowship of Rotarians was set up to 
				do. Is this being prepared so to be done best soonest ?<br>
				<br>
				I'd greatly appreciate your comments also on this. And now just 
				2 comments about The Solution: - Since Rotary Fellowships do 
				welcome Rotarians, their spouses and Rotaractors, there was the 
				need to clarify/specify if only Rotarians can be members of 
				RRSAs, and this is covered by point 5. of TheSolution, as in 
				your message.<br>
				- Re pt 6., it is ok to have 10% of any fundraising for RI, but 
				it would be good if RI could contribute to help for this not to 
				be a hinderance for the success of the fundraising by assuring 
				that it will earmark and spend that cash for causes directly 
				related to the purpose for which the cash was raised.<br>
				<br>
				Regarding The Results, I have the following remarks:<br>
				<br>
				- Over 80 years after 1923, the changed global situation does 
				amply justify the reversing of the 1923 decision.<br>
				- RRSAs are necessary, and you are also so right in the 
				paragraph where you mention the UN's Millennium Goals and the 
				need for ResultsBased Management as it applies to 'doing good in 
				the world'. - Rotary has pioneered helping humankind in 
				sustainable development, and the RRSAs, which truly fill a great 
				void, will help do do it<br>
				better, in a way adapted to the present needs !<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Believing that the proposed RRSAs will greatly help Rotary to 
				better serve its object in Rotary's second century, and 
				remaining fully at your disposal for any additional information 
				and comments you might wish, I look forward to remain in contact 
				and am gratefully yours in Rotary fellowship,<br>

				Dear John,<br>
				<br>
				First, please forgive me for not getting back to you re a 
				possible conference call. Gosh, I was overwhelmed from the time 
				I got back from Africa, to having relatives for Thanksgiving 
				holiday, and then back to work. Things are a bit more settled 
				now, and I'd like to respond to acouple of things.<br>
				<br>
				In a separate email I wrote you, Kevin and Raju, I responded 
				positively to your invitation to the CRCID Board meeting. I will 
				appreciate some clarification from you regarding your 
				expectations of us after reading my other email. There is very 
				good reason to believe that the multi-country ANCHOR project 
				could spread to some of the countries you have targeted in RI 
				District 9200, if that is something you desire. I am also 
				gathering<br>
				that you have an interest in going to CIDA for large funding, is 
				that correct? Anyhow, you'll read my questions in the other 
				email. <br>
				<br>
				Finally, I reviewed your concept paper on creating a separate 
				entity (ies) within Rotary International that are for 
				like-minded service-minded Rotarians and using that entity 
				rather than a fellowship. I certainly don't have a &quot;real&quot; vote 
				in this, but I guess I'd have to say that I would not be 
				interested in having your concept take place -- primarily 
				because<br>
				we're already &quot;down the road&quot; in working on HIV/AIDS through the 
				Fellowship. Our fellowship is incorporated here in the State of 
				Georgia, and I've recently applied for non-profit 501(c)3 status 
				in the U.S. We've written Bylaws, have a great Board of 
				Directors, and I've managed to do all of this while staying 
				within the guidelines of Rotary International. We have RFFA 
				Country Chairs in England, India, and a few other countries. The 
				fellowship serves my purpose because it is RI Board-approved, 
				and I've<br>
				already gained that status. It can be a separate operating 
				entity for me when I wish to form partnerships in other parts of 
				the world -- so I am happy with this situation. I'm really not 
				lacking in anything I need at the present time.<br>
				<br>
				I hope you are enjoying safe travel, and I look forward to 
				talking with you upon your return. I'll be in town all the month 
				of December.<br>
				<br>
				Most sincerely,<br>

				Hello John,<br>
				<br>
				Very interesting reading! I am not at all surprised this has 
				come to a head, given the actions of the Population Control 
				group around the COL.<br>
				<br>
				I think this proposal is conceptually good. It will distinguish 
				between <br>
				true &quot;Fellowship&quot; groups and &quot;cause-oriented&quot; groups and focus 
				the <br>
				important differences.<br>
				<br>
				It seems to me that &quot;The Solution&quot; tries to &quot;soften&quot; the 
				operational impact on existing &quot;cause-oriented&quot; groups and, as a 
				result, is not demanding enough. To say an RRSA must have be 
				incorporated in Illinois with constating documents approved by 
				the General Secretary, impose the requirements of items 4, 5, 
				12, 13, 14, 15 and grant the endorsement implied in items 7, 8, 
				9, 11 says they are very much a part of the RI <br>
				family. To not require coverage under RI Insurance, given the 
				likely activities and associations of an RRSA (to say nothing of 
				the &quot;zealots&quot;), seems inconsistent. RI would be endorsing the 
				RRSAs but not asking them to be fully fiscally responsible.<br>
				<br>
				Your proposal flies with me, with the one change. I can see it 
				as being in the same spirit as the New Models Pilot Project, 
				which I feel is essential to the survival of Rotary<br>
				<br>
				Thanks for seeking my comments.<br>

				<br>
				The purpose of this memo is to ask your clarification on some 
				points set out in your November proposal regarding Fellowships.<br>
				<br>
				I am acting as the founder and current chair of the Polio 
				Survivors and Associates Fellowship (PSA).as you know, I am a 
				former Fellowships Chair.<br>
				I was aware of that - Congratulations for taking this on. We are 
				hearing more and more of the malady of the &quot;survivors&quot; and 
				Rotary surely has a role to play here!<br>
				<br>
				You might be interested in reading an excellent series on polio 
				done by the London Free Press which included some interesting 
				anecdotes and good research on polio survivors.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				I propose to ask the Board of Directors of PSA for their 
				comments and suggestions; however, before forwarding the 
				proposal to them I am asking clarification on the following 
				points.:<br>
				<br>
				Page 1.pp6.am I correct that the word &quot;unofficial&quot; should read 
				&quot;official&quot;.?<br>
				No. This would be an &quot;unofficial program&quot; like fellowship groups 
				or youth exchange are &quot;unofficial activities&quot;<br>
				<br>
				Page 8.under &quot;The Solution&quot; item #2.during the start-up phase of 
				our Fellowship we have no dues. This may be changed at our 
				annual meeting to &gt; be held in Chicago on Monday June 20 
				depending upon perceived need. Is it correct to assume dues will 
				not be assessed by RI if the Fellowship does not need 
				dues.Fishing Fellowship, for example has liminated their 
				dues.some of us believe dues collection is both a burden on the 
				structure and a deterrent to membership.<br>
				If this proposal were to be adopted, the fellowship groups such 
				as Polio Survivors (I assume, although I have not read its 
				chartering documents so do not know if it is intended to right a 
				wrong, raise money or be advocates for the cause; or, be 
				exclusivly for “fellowship&quot; contact) could determine whether or 
				not it charges a membership fee. If it were the former, then it 
				would, under this proposal, be an affiliate service organization 
				and not a fellowship group.<br>
				<br>
				item 5.a basic purpose of PSA is to connect Rotarians with 
				non-Rotarian individuals, organizations, institutions, etc. 
				already in the field of helping polio survivors.one of our PSA 
				directors is a non-Rotarian &quot;Associate&quot; and the director of an 
				international polio<br>
				organization.she is our most knowledgeable and important member 
				of the Board.without a close working relationship with the 
				institutions already in the field, we would not have a viable 
				organization.as written this could create a serious problem for 
				us, up to an including putting us our of business.as you know, 
				the current definitions of Fellowships call for inclusion of 
				spouses, Rotaract members, etc..some of us feel strongly that we 
				need to be more inclusive with the family of Rotary.I realize 
				this could be an important issue in such cases as &quot;risk 
				management&quot;.I am raising raising the question now, because it 
				could have impact of other Fellowships.especially RV, 
				Caravanning, Flying, etc.<br>
				<br>
				You raise a good question Jack. Frankly, I have not heard of 
				fellowship groups having non-rotarian members. On the other 
				hand, the RRSA concept (which given the content of the paragraph 
				above) suggests PSA would probably fit in that entity box. In 
				that event, it would be encouraged to collaborate with 
				knowledgeable experts in the field of endevour and as a result 
				raise the level of its potential efficacy of the cause.<br>
				<br>
				I have advocated recognition and support by RI of 
				service-oriented Fellowships.Recreational and Vocational 
				Fellowships have long operated very successfully with no 
				tangible help from RI.with the advent of the Fellowships website 
				(which is an entirely grass roots enterprise and received no 
				help or financing from Rotary). very little staff help is 
				needed.your proposal for recognition of RRSA (Fellowships) is 
				what many of us have been advocating, but it must be &quot;supported&quot; 
				properly by RI to be viable and effective.<br>
				<br>
				I agree I am in winter quarters and cannot seem to be able to 
				attach material to this email.therefore, I am asking Jack 
				Campbell, PSA webmaster to forward to you our standard 
				definition, mission, purpose, etc. of PSA to help you to 
				understand what PSA is designed to do.<br>
				<br>
				Thanks - I look forward to receiving that!<br>
				<br>
				I assure you, those of us who have labored long in the 
				Fellowships vineyard appreciate your interest and your effort. 
				Thanks for taking the trouble to respond! I look forward to your 
				collective views and can assure you that they will be heard at 
				the committee. Given your considerable personal experience, your 
				comments will be welcomed! Thanks, again for keen observations 
				and help.<br>

				Dear John,<br>
				<br>
				I owe an apology to you for not sending my reaction to the 
				detailed proposal on &quot;Registered Rotary Services Affiliates&quot; 
				statement which you had given me in December, 2004 when we met 
				for the Kolkata Institute. <br>
				<br>
				All these weeks and months I have been involved in many hectic 
				activities and travels including some unforeseen and hence the 
				delay. I know you must have already had the deliberations on 
				this matter at your Committee level and, therefore, my comments 
				here may be superfluous. These comments will be superfluous for 
				another reason which is that you have dealt with the subject so 
				comprehensively that there is nothing more that I can add except 
				complimenting you for dealing with the subject in a most 
				realistic and pragmatic manner. While we were discussing this 
				issue I had already made my initial comment that the programme 
				or service cause related activities cannot be called 
				fellowships. Perhaps they were accepted upto a certain point but 
				then as we grow bigger we need to recognize the emerging needs 
				of the organization. <br>
				<br>
				Your proposal of RRSA duly answers that need. Not only some of 
				the programmes you have indicated but there are many others 
				which have grown from Rotary and are still basically working 
				with Rotary and doing very useful work. Why should Rotary loose 
				such focused programmes and Rotarians who have focused interest 
				in such programmes. You have rightly observed that encouragement 
				of such activities might create greater interest in Rotary, give 
				it an added identity and attract more members. Programmes like 
				Gift of Life, Heartbeat International, Permanent Smiles (I think 
				the name is different but something to do with cleft lips) are 
				such successful activities which are continuing to <br>
				function with strong Rotary connection and having international 
				dimension. <br>
				<br>
				You have rightly observed that in promoting RRSA and officially 
				recognizing them there might be some legal ramifications and 
				serious ones. They can all be taken care of including the 
				insurance situation as long as Rotary International is fully 
				indemnified. <br>
				<br>
				As I started reading the note I was developing ideas in my mind 
				and then I realized that all of them have already been summed up 
				when I came towards the concluding part of your proposal. <br>
				<br>
				Per capita dues is important; registration is important; 
				restriction on use of Rotary logo and following the requirement 
				as licensed vendor is relevant. So also are all other points you 
				have mentioned. I have, however, not been able to understand 
				item 9 fully. My own view is that RRSAs should not be allowed to 
				generally circularize their activities for solicitation for 
				funds from the Rotary clubs/districts worldwide. Some kind of 
				restriction has to be there and may be an approval of the Board 
				of Directors of Rotary International/the R.I.President/the 
				General Secretary/the District Governor where circularization is 
				solicited. In this regard item 10 does not fully provide the 
				safeguard because solicitation of funds for the cause may not be 
				termed as commercial =<br>
				purpose. <br>
				<br>
				I believe that there should be yet another safeguard that no 
				RRSA would undertake any activity that would be repugnant to the 
				objectives, policies of Rotary International spelled out in its 
				constitutional documents or Board of Directors decisions. For 
				example no RRSA should be allowed to take up any activities that 
				would be intending to create discrimination on religious grounds 
				or otherwise forbidden by Rotary. Another example could be the 
				case of abortions where there is no R.I.policy but if the RRSA 
				dealing with the population takes up this policy or activity it 
				should through a policy adopted by the R.I. forbid it. <br>
				<br>
				By the time this letter reaches you I myself will have the 
				opportunity of meeting you in person. We will be able to extend 
				our discussions then. <br>
				<br>
				Regretting the delay again and looking forward to meeting you 
				soon.<br>
				<br>
				Yours sincerely<br>

				RID John has prepared a thoughtful and, if I may say so, very 
				exciting, new avenue for outreach to the present &quot;marginal&quot; 
				activities of Rotarians. I say marginal because that is where 
				the Rotary Fellowshipshave always been placed, in limbo. Are 
				they really part of Rotary or not?<br>
				<br>
				I would endorse this concept as the natural extension of the 
				Fellowship<br>
				program, for the expansion of the concept of Rotarian service 
				and as a<br>
				membership enhancing initiative.<br>

				<br>
				You were very kind and I was honored to receive your invitation 
				to respond on your proposals for RI Fellowships. I have not 
				responded until now for a number of reasons. Please permit me to 
				offer a few thoughts without going into or trying to edit any of 
				your detailed notes.<br>
				<br>
				First, I applaud your efforts to seek advice from others 
				experienced in Fellowships. When on the RI Board, I had found 
				the history and traditions of many of our programs and policies 
				lost or conveniently misplaced. I learned this after some 
				decisions where made, unfortunately.<br>
				<br>
				Additionally, The emphasis to create a Strategic Plan that lists 
				the programs emphasied of Rotary and The Rotary Foundation has 
				many pluses. However, there are <br>
				Rotarians and some Rotary leaders that will use influence with 
				others to support their <br>
				&quot;pet&quot; service project(s) under a banner of a RI Fellowship. It 
				seemed to me that when money for matching grants became tight, 
				many used new fellowships to put pressure on Rotary leaders to 
				recognize their pet cause and obtain matching funds. I know a 
				few things, one of which no person or even the RI Board can 
				fully control Rotarians or Rotary clubs. I also believe that 
				Fellowships is a tool that the RI Board could and should use to 
				help unite Rotarians globally in friendship - service will 
				certainly follow. <br>
				<br>
				I should be very honest and up front with you here in saying I 
				opposed most cause related fellowships when they came to the 
				board. This may be considered &quot;old Rotary&quot;. I based this 
				rationale on a number of experiences. I recall the many 
				conventions that had Fellowship booths that drew the attention 
				of first time convention goers and future club leaders. Many of 
				them came home and told their Rotary club of the Fellowship for 
				Coin Collectors, etc. It built their enthusiasm for Rotary, was 
				an enabler to unite Rotarians with considerable financial 
				differences, did not ask them for another contribution and 
				served the association well. I know stories of those who met at 
				a convention fellowship booth that later generated youth 
				exchanges and GSE teams.<br>
				<br>
				I would hope that any new or revised policy keeps it as simple 
				as possible. Your new approach may be just what Rotary needs.<br>
				<br>
				Thank you and best wishes for your efforts . I look forward to 
				seeing you in Anaheim and sharing the joy of our centennial 
				convention.<br>
				<br>
				Best regards,<br>

				Dear Chuck:<br>
				<br>
				Thank you for your thoughtful letter dated September 7, 2004. I 
				apologize for my tardiness in responding. As I am sure you are 
				aware, September has been a busy month in Zone 22!<br>
				<br>
				I share your interest and concern for the evolving issues 
				concerning fellowship groups. Having been involved in six or 
				eight “fellowships” and having formed and nurtured one for 
				approximately ten years, I have a sense for the structure as 
				well as an appreciation for the enduring value of a formal means 
				by which Rotarians can enjoy fellowship at the international 
				level. <br>
				<br>
				Clearly the interest and growth of fellowship groups in recent 
				years is indicative of a void which is being filled by various 
				Rotary entities. This, in itself, is a commentary on the needs 
				of Rotarians to find a conduit through which fellowship can be 
				enjoyed. The philosophical question which has always interested 
				me is: which comes first, fellowship or service? Does fellowship 
				stimulate within us a need to provide service to our fellow man 
				or in the process of undertaking a service activity, do we get 
				as much satisfaction from the fellowship of our fellow Rotarians 
				who are similarly engaged?<br>
				<br>
				There has always been an underlying theme that each fellowship 
				group might have a “service activity” associated with it. The 
				“flyers” deliver eyeglasses, the “canoeists” clean up waterways, 
				the “bird watchers” take garbage bags with them on their treks 
				into the wilderness. The point you make is valid. At what point 
				does a fellowship group become “project-oriented”? Is there some 
				line across which an activity might be described as being more 
				in the nature of a “cause-related” undertaking by a variety of 
				zealots for reasons other than the pure enjoyment of the 
				fellowship arising from the collegiality in the service 
				activity? At what point does the fellowship group begin to 
				encroach and create prejudice (time, human resources, financial) 
				to other Rotary programs? <br>
				<br>
				It might fairly be argued that the fellowship groups (i.e. the 
				medical related ones - fight against AIDS, population concerns, 
				etc.) become increasingly popular because there is no other 
				Rotary entity that provides the scope or opportunity to address 
				issues of human need.<br>
				<br>
				The International committees and task forces are ill-equipped 
				and have an uncertain mandate to undertake these activities. 
				Similarly, the scope of activity undertaken on a club to club or 
				district to district basis is limited by geography and numbers 
				of people. At the same time the “menu of service” opportunities 
				and “structured” programs of Rotary are offered only as 
				suggestions to clubs and do not, in themselves, create programs 
				at the international level. Consequently, the void is being 
				filled by imaginative and energetic Rotarians who want to 
				utilize the “Rotary network” for purposes of “doing good in the 
				world” with or without the help of the Rotary Foundation. <br>
				<br>
				These competing areas of interest are allowing many Rotarians to 
				focus their interests and efforts for service. Your penultimate 
				question: “Is the business and function of the fellowship groups 
				to continue to be “fellowship” or is it to become service or 
				something else?”, is relevant. Indeed, this is one of the 
				reasons why a committee has been established for the purpose of 
				studying the fellowship groups. <br>
				<br>
				At the moment, the principle question before the committee will 
				be whether or not to permit fundraising by fellowship groups for 
				purposes other than the administration of the group itself. I 
				dare say, if the $25,000.00 rule is permitted to stand, 
				fellowship groups will simply find a mechanism to avoid the 
				Rotary policy. This has already happened in at least two 
				fellowship groups to my knowledge. In those cases, the 
				fellowship groups used unrelated NGO’s for purposes of raising 
				the funds and complementing the program. In many ways, this in 
				itself is harmful to Rotary because it reduces Rotary’s ability 
				to enhance its public image and deflects activity from the 
				fellowship group itself into another NGO. The loss of energy and 
				funds to Rotary International is a concern. At the same time, to 
				allow these entities to undertake these major service projects 
				directly, raises issues such as third party liability and 
				Rotary’s inability to control the release of public information 
				in the name of Rotary and, of course, protection of the Rotary 
				“marks”.<br>
				<br>
				So, you have my “thoughts on the subject.” They too are evolving 
				and I will be following with great interest the work of the 
				committee and the action to be taken by the Board at the 
				November meeting. <br>
				<br>
				The fellowships committee under the current chairman, Mark Wong, 
				is very active and provides excellent communication among its 
				members. In the last year I have noticed that the committee has 
				not recommended fellowship groups which replicate either current 
				programs of Rotary or the Rotary Foundation. For example, it has 
				rejected the notion of a United Nations fellowship group on the 
				theory that Rotary already has a committee that is directly 
				connected to the United Nations. It has also rejected the 
				“International Service” fellowship group as being too general 
				and replicating an inherent “program” of R.I. At the same time, 
				the WCS Resource Network service fellowship group has been 
				disbanded in part because of the confusion between the 
				fellowship group and a structured program of Rotary 
				International. <br>
				<br>
				Again, thank you for your penetrating glance at the issue of 
				fellowships. Fran and I did indeed miss you and Carol at the 
				Zone 27-28 Institute. However, we look forward to seeing you 
				soon and, until then, wish you best personal regards.<br>
				<br>
				Sincerely, <br>

				RI Board Meeting – February, 2005<br>
				<br>
				Suggested decision of the Programs Committee:<br>
				<br>
				Statement:<br>
				<br>
				Director John Eberhard has referred a suggestion to the programs 
				committee that would separate the “service” or “cause-related” 
				fellowship groups from the recreational and vocational 
				fellowship groups. The programs committee agrees with this 
				change to the structured programs of RI and requests the Board 
				to endorse this suggestion. Given the current code of policy 
				prohibition from creating a new structured program without 
				eliminating an existing one, the proposal is to have these 
				organized “service fellowship” groups be henceforth know as 
				“Rotary Service Affiliates” (RSA) and become official programs 
				of Rotary International sheltered for policy considerations 
				under the Structured Program of “World Community Service”. The 
				creation of this Rotary service delivery entity under the WCS 
				Structured Program would separate the “cause related” (or 
				service fellowship groups) from the traditional Recreational and 
				Vocational Groups that would continue to be known as Fellowship 
				Groups. An RSA would be subject to policies created to 
				facilitate the enhancement of effective International Rotary 
				service<br>
				<br>
				By adopting this proposal, “Fellowships”, by definition, would 
				return to their historic role of catering exclusively to the 
				vocational and recreational interests of their members. Any 
				service rendered by the Fellowship Group is incidental to its 
				principal objective. <br>
				<br>
				The distinguishing threshold would be whether or not the group 
				was formed and conducts its activity in a way that primarily 
				shares common recreational or vocational interests. A RSA on the 
				other hand would be formed and function with a specific service 
				activity focus and notwithstanding the incidental fellowship 
				experienced by the members, would be task or service-delivery 
				oriented. <br>
				<br>
				It is understood that President Glenn Estess has reviewed the 
				Eberhard proposal and has agreed to form an ad hoc committee to 
				study its merits for the purpose of determining the relevance to 
				the strategic planning process and determine if any COL action 
				is required to implement the change.<br>
				<br>
				The background information is attached.<br>
				<br>
				Suggested Decision of the Programs Committee<br>
				<br>
				The Board agrees that:<br>
				<br>
				1. “Rotary Service Affiliate” (RSA) shall become an official 
				program of Rotary International and sheltered for policy 
				considerations under the Structured Program of “World Community 
				Service”. <br>
				<br>
				2. The general Secretary shall identify existing Fellowship 
				Groups that have been formed or are functioning in a way which 
				is intended to be service oriented for the purpose of having 
				them recognized as “Rotary Service Affiliates” (RSA)<br>
				<br>
				3. in principal, an RSA is framed within the following 
				guidelines:<br>
				<br>
				a. A RSA is a Rotary entity engaged in service oriented 
				activity.<br>
				<br>
				b. A RSA would be an incorporated body with constitution and 
				bylaws approved by the General Secretary of RI and in accordance 
				with RI Policy<br>
				<br>
				c. A RSA as an RI WCS program would receive the same services 
				from the RI Secretariat as any other structured program, 
				including space at the annual international convention for 
				meeting rooms and space in the House of Friendship on the same 
				terms as other Rotary entities<br>
				<br>
				d. While not covered by RI Insurance, an individual RSA is 
				encouraged to assess its own risk exposures and secure coverage 
				as appropriate<br>
				<br>
				e. The membership of an RSA is restricted to individual members 
				of Rotary Clubs, spouses of Rotarians and Rotaractors<br>
				<br>
				f. No circularization or financial solicitation by a RSA shall 
				be allowed for commercial or other purposes not in conformity 
				with the code of policies<br>
				<br>
				g. The RSA would be recognized in the Official Directory of RI 
				and be authorized to create its own website for purpose of 
				conducting it “business”<br>
				<br>
				h. The RSA would be subject to the Code of Policy in respect of 
				all requirements associated with the use of the RI Marks.<br>
				<br>
				i. The RSA operating under the umbrella of World Community 
				Service would be subject to this cooperative relations policy of 
				RI.<br>
				<br>
				j. A RSA, on application, could be recognized by the Rotary 
				Foundation for purposes of extending matched Grants and 3-H 
				Grants to the RSA on terms and conditions as may be established 
				by the trustees.<br>
				<br>
				k. The RSA would report the G/S annually on its activities in a 
				prescribed format including a listing of current and ongoing 
				cooperative relationships or sponsorships and programs 
				undertaken during the year<br>
				<br>
				l. Annually and within 3 months of its year end, the RSA shall 
				file a financial report on a prescribed format established by 
				the general secretary<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				4. this decision be referred to the General Secretary for the 
				purpose of recommending the necessary correlative changes in the 
				code of policies at the November 2005 meeting of the Board.<br>
				<br>
				5. the decision be referred to the President’s new Ad Hoc 
				Committee to Study Rotary Service Affiliates and the relevant 
				strategic planning study committees for report back to the 
				programs committee before the November, 2005 Board meeting.<br>
				<br>
				6. the programs committee report to the board on its 
				recommendation on the final terms of reference of RSA at the 
				November Board meeting <br>
				<br>
				7. The purpose and intent of the referrals is to have the Board 
				approve the respective policy amendments for implementation of 
				the RSA program of World Community Service to become effective 
				as of January 1, 2006 <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Background<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Rotary Fellowships started as a Programme of Rotary 
				International to encourage recreational and vocational 
				activities by Rotarians and to establish a network of Rotarians 
				though having diverse background but having common interest. 
				Rotary Fellowships also encourage people to join Rotary.<br>
				<br>
				Over a period of time the fellowships also started taking active 
				interest in humanitarian concerns as well and thus perceived to 
				be competing with Rotary Foundation Programames and Presidential 
				emphases. Two of the fellowships “Rotarians fight against AIDS” 
				and “Population Concerns” have become increasingly popular and a 
				lot of lobbying activity has been observed recently for having 
				standing committees etc. Not only that, Fellowship of Rotarians 
				fight against AIDS, has been recently successful to get a 
				substantial grant from USAID as well. They are implementing a 
				well conceived “health concerns” program with highly competent 
				and recognized non-rotary entities in a way that that no other 
				Rotary entity is capable, at the moment, of doing. These 
				included RI Task Forces or RI Committees which are not 
				structures in a way to actually carry our projects.<br>
				<br>
				This has raised some eyebrows with the Rotary International 
				Leadership. Firstly The Rotary Foundation is approaching the 
				same agencies for its programmes, Secondly what will happen if a 
				liability arises out of any such action of Fellowships.<br>
				<br>
				“Service” Fellowship Groups are “Rotary-related” in that they 
				are made up of Rotarians, spouses and Rotaractors who are not 
				involved primarily as a result of a club initiative or 
				exclusively for “fellowship”. They simply comprise of dedicated 
				and passionate Rotarians who have a particular need (interest) 
				in serving mankind by assisting to “do good in the world” with a 
				group of like-minded individuals. They are focused. They often 
				have specialized expertise in the service area in which they are 
				involved. In the words of Rotary’s Strategic plan, the groups 
				have “sharpened the program focus of Rotary” by concentrating on 
				a particular activity.<br>
				<br>
				These like-minded Rotarians have tremendous pent up energy, 
				resources and determination to contribute to their favorite 
				clause. Many are enthusiasts who simply want to participate 
				inside a Rotary entity to serve mankind. Some simply passively 
				support the “cause” by being members or by making a financial 
				contribution. At the present time Rotary International does not 
				provide an appropriate vehicle for this growing contingent of 
				individual Rotarians to carry their service tools<br>
				<br>
				Among the Fellowship Groups that comprise the growing list of 
				cause-related entities are:<br>
				<br>
				o Rotary Fellowship for Fighting Aids<br>
				o Rotary Fellowship of Disaster Managers and Responders<br>
				o Rotary Fellowship of Environment<br>
				o Rotary Fellowship for Eye Care<br>
				o International Fellowship of Rotarians Affected by Hearing Loss<br>
				o Humanitarian Service Resource Fellowship<br>
				o Fellowship for Mine Action<br>
				o Rotarian Fellowship of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness<br>
				o Rotarian Fellowship for Population and Development<br>
				o International Fellowship of Rotarian Dental Volunteers<br>
				o International Fellowship for the Prevention of Drug Abuse<br>
				o International Fellowship of Rotarian Dental Volunteers<br>
				o Fellowship of Literacy Providers<br>
				<br>
				It may be that the General Secretary can identify others.<br>
				<br>
				On one side we have seen the tremendous success of networking in 
				the case of Polio eradication, which has brought great 
				recognition to Rotary as a service organization and its 
				capability to work through its network of 30,000 clubs with 1.2 
				million members in almost all parts of the world. In many 
				countries, Governments and other service organizations have 
				started approaching Rotary to join hands for their community 
				welfare projects. On one hand fellowships can not compete with 
				Rotary Foundation but at the same time we can not let go these 
				National, regional initiatives which Rotary today is capable of 
				and is sought for.<br>
				<br>
				In June 2004 (decision 257) the Board requested the G/S to 
				develop a revised cooperative relationship policy based on the 
				Rotary Code section 11.050.6 that would apply to all Rotary 
				entities as defined in Code Section 1.010 (point 12). The Board 
				deferred consideration of this matter to it’s February 2005 
				meeting. It is suggested that an RSA operating under the 
				umbrella of World Community Service would be subject to this 
				policy.<br>
				<br>
				Rotary has 9 programs called “Structured Programs” (which many 
				Rotarians refer to as “official programs of Rotary”. Rotary’s 
				web site proclaims:<br>
				<br>
				“Rotary International offers a broad range of humanitarian, 
				intercultural, and educational programs and activities designed 
				to improve the human condition and advance the organization's 
				ultimate goal of world understanding and peace. Nine structured 
				programs and nine service opportunities help clubs and districts 
				achieve their service goals in their own communities and in 
				communities abroad, fostering fellowship and goodwill in the 
				process.”<br>
				<br>
				The Structured Programs include:<br>
				• Rotary Fellowships<br>
				• World Community Service<br>
				<br>
				This proposal provides recognition of an RSA’s as a service 
				delivery vehicle for WCS for the purpose of undertaking 
				international service projects. As is presently the case with 
				the “cause related” Fellowship Groups, the make-up of an RSA 
				would be of members from clubs from all over the world united in 
				the determination to serve a particular cause while being 
				required to continue to be active members of their own Rotary 
				Clubs. The RSA’s would be expected to continue to utilize the 
				Rotary club network just as do the present Fellowship Groups<br>
				<br>
				This is a changing World and Rotary has to adopt ways and means 
				to meet aspirations of the people and not miss the role it is 
				destined for its service activities. There is a need to create 
				another vehicle for such associations, which are not complex 
				like multi-district activities, or do not require a plethora of 
				formalities and permissions from Rotary International on the use 
				of term “Rotary” and also at the same time it should safeguard 
				any future liability accruable to Rotary International arising 
				out of the activities of such special vehicles.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				RRSA Proposal<br>
				The “Eberhard Proposal” circulated in October, 2004 has been, in 
				part, circulated to the Ad Hoc Jim Lacy committee. The acronym 
				RRSA (Rotary Registered Service Affiliate) was changed (as were 
				a number of the details after circulation to several Rotarians). 
				A revised proposal entitled “Rotary Service Affiliates” with a 
				board action plan was distributed to the Programs Committee in 
				February 2005. The group circularized as a trial balloon 
				included the RI Fellowships Committee, RI Board members and six 
				past RI Presidents. In addition, about 10 Rotarians who, to the 
				knowledge of the writer, have long and extensive experience in 
				Fellowship activity were included. Chairpersons of the most 
				active Service Fellowship Groups were included. The results were 
				surprising. Somehow, the number of respondents grew (the power 
				of Email)! There were 48 responses received. The entire list and 
				replies would be available to the committee from RI staff. Since 
				the circulation did not specify a question/answer format, the 
				table below represents a subjective extraction of comments from 
				individual responses. While the report itself did not lend 
				itself to statistically scientific results, certain themes 
				became evident. In a separate report, I categorized the results 
				according to the following headings:</p>
