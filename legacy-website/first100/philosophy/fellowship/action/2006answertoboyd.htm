				<a href="../../../historians/eberhard.htm">JJE</a></b><br><br>Letter to the Chairman of the RAGs Committee from 
				President-Elect Bill Boyd: 
				<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #800000">
				(an attempt to provide some answers follow in red ink)</span><br>
				<br>9 March2006<br>Brian H. Knowles<br>Past Director, Rotary International<br>17 Bayview St.<br>Runaway Bay, Qld.,<br>Australia 4216<br>
				<br>Dear Brian:<br><br>I have a concern that the potential growth of Rotary Action 
				Groups (RAGs) may have a<br>serious impact on Board authority and existing programs and I 
				have some questions for<br>the Rotary Action Groups Committee. As chairman, I wanted you to 
				know of my<br>concerns.<br><br><font color="#800000">The opening question by Bill appears to be a reasonable position 
				from which to advance a negative opinion of what a RAG is and 
				more importantly, how a RAG is governed under the existing Code 
				of policy provisions. The fact that these are questions are 
				written under the signature of the President should not preclude 
				that possibility that many of them are expressions of staff held 
				views. However, they should be treated positively and as 
				legitimate concerns. <br><br>• I am convinced that many of Bill’s comments in this letter 
				reflect the staff concerns that were expressed before the Board 
				recognized this new program policy area – I do not know how much 
				experience Bill has had with either Fellowship Groups or 
				International Development work being done by the existing RAGS. 
				The question suggests a bias toward the value of RAGS and this 
				form of WCS delivery.<br><br>• While the many observations that have been made on the new 
				Global Networking Program have been overwhelmingly positive, I 
				do know that there is a staff bias which is in the nature of a 
				sincere desire to &quot;protect&quot; the &quot;corporate RI&quot;. 
				<br><br>• This is basically a resistance to &quot;change&quot; as compared to an 
				attitude to frame a policy environment that encourages Rotarians 
				in what they do best - service - and still keep the interests of 
				RI paramount!<br><br>• In the final analysis, we have to trust Rotarians who are 
				performing service in this structure just as we do within the 
				club structure. So long as their activities are circumscribed by 
				a set of rules (Code of Policies), and RI is separated from them 
				(to the same extent that the Polio Plus program is segregated, 
				RI will be protected<br><br>• The kiss of death for RAGs would be a referral of the concept 
				to the Council on Legislation. The policy framework should be 
				governed by Board policy. Perhaps after the policy has allowed 
				the RAGs to mature and thus be better defined in a 
				constitutional framework, the COL would be the place to address 
				specific program issues.<br></font><br><br><br>You will receive a board document presented by the General 
				Secretary which gives<br>background on the current status of RAGs. 
				<br><br><font color="#800000">• I hope there will be an objective and detailed and balanced 
				staff advanced memorandum. </font><br><br>These came about because the existing program of Fellowships, 
				designed for groups of Rotarians with recreational or vocational 
				interests became the vehicle for groups with causes or specific 
				program interests. The rules governing fellowships were not 
				appropriate for these groups, usually driven by a passion, and 
				the Board decided to establish the new category of RAG's.<br>
				<br><font color="#800000">This is not a balanced statement! And, is to some degree, 
				misleading. The first Ad Hoc Board Committee (2005) recommended 
				the division between “activity” groups and fellowship groups. It 
				was chaired by David Morgan and David Roper was its advisor. <br>
				<br>• This decision by the Board came after the recognition that 
				these “activity” groups are playing a major role in WCS and the 
				public image of Rotary through useful service and fellowship 
				activities are consistent with the Object of Rotary.<br><br>• The decision was taken only after 18 months of Board 
				deliberation which included the presidentially appointed Ad Hoc 
				Committee (as noted above) to consider the concept and a special 
				Board Committee that reviewed the separation in much detail.<br>
				<br>• Two standing Committees of the Board recommended the action 
				(“Administration” – from a legal point of view; and, “Program”, 
				from a program point of view. The decision of the Board was 
				unanimous with the President not voting.<br><br>• It should be noted here that few people in positions of 
				authority at the Board level or at the committee level have much 
				personal experience with Fellowship groups and therefore do not 
				fully appreciate the tremendous contribution they have made to 
				Rotary over many years (with virtually no negative consequences)<br>
				<br>• “Passion” is not a dirty word. Indeed, it is what has driven 
				virtually every positive change that Rotary has migrated through 
				over the past 100 years!<br></font><br><br>These have given enthusiastic Rotarians with a cause the 
				opportunity to promote their<br>interest <br><br>
				<font color="#800000">• This is a misleading remark. It is not “their” cause” It is a 
				cause in which they have a personal interest or expertise – and 
				one that cannot be satisfied exclusively within the confines of 
				the local club. It is an individual Rotarian’s way of 
				contributing to world community service in collaboration with 
				others of similar interest.<br><br>• They are not new causes – they are “causes” that are set out 
				for the most part in Rotary’s “Menu of Service Opportunities”, 
				traditional Rotary WCS projects and programs; the Strategic Plan 
				of Rotary; or, the Millennium goals. <br><br>• The “opportunity to promote” is quite simply, a way for 
				individuals to perform service in our service organization using 
				a new and improved vehicle for delivery. <br><br>• S 43.020 states that the group is a “voluntary association of 
				Rotarians who unite themselves for the purpose of conducting 
				international service projects that advance the Object of 
				rotary”. The Board agreed in 2005 that this was sufficient 
				“guidance” for a responsible Rotary entity – just as it is for 
				Clubs</font><br><br><br>in a vehicle that carries the name of Rotarians, but which 
				operates with minimal<br>Board control.<br><br>•<font color="#800000"> The whole idea of the Code of Policies is to do just that!<br>
				<br>• S. 43.020.2 specifically states that RAG and its governing 
				document must be consistent with RI policy – the Board thought 
				this was sufficiently clear? <br><br>• “All have to be approved by the Board” !!!<br>
				<br>• The C. of P. can be used (or twigged where necessary) for this 
				purpose. But it should not be used to restrict to such an extent 
				that the programs of the RAGs are made impotent (unless another 
				program vehicle is created to fill the void)<br><br>• The control mechanisms can also be found in the Strategic Plan 
				process<br><br>• A concern that is often repeated is that RAGs hold out as 
				representing Rotary International. I do not believe this to be 
				the case! A Chair or member of the RAG cannot represent Rotary 
				International. I do not believe that any has done that! I have 
				read some RAG documents and find them to consistently show the 
				group as Rotarians For Fighting AIDS -a Rotarian Action Group / 
				or land mines etc and that it “consists of a group of 
				like-minded Rotarians from over 60 countries that have a concern 
				about orphans, etc., etc.&quot; Since Rotary International does not 
				have a strategy in place to collectively address a particular 
				cause (i.e. Polio), these special interest groups have formed 
				pursuant to RI policy and carry on work independently of the 
				international organization but work through individual Rotarians 
				and Rotary Clubs.</font><br><br><br><br>The RAG's elect their own officers, who have only the 
				requirement to be &quot;active<br>Rotarians&quot;. The length of tenure is decided by their own bylaws. 
				One, as an example,<br>has a two year term for their President,<br>
				<br><font color="#800000">• This is arguably a very good thing – continuity and a viable 
				democratic process for leadership selection will weed out those 
				who are ineffective or abusing the office)<br><br>• Governance of Rotary clubs through the new models systems has 
				(and is demonstrating) that the way “we have always done it” is 
				not necessarily the way to sustain our organization. A RAG 
				allows for these differences and though those that have been 
				active with continuity of leadership and even professional staff 
				that are in place for multi-year terms, there is the potential 
				for better long-term multi-year sustainable results!</font><br>
				<br><br>who may serve up to three terms. <br><br>
				<font color="#800000">• Rotary in my view should not try to micro-manage this process 
				but if a comfort level is necessary, the Code could be twigged 
				to provide a uniform governance structure that addresses this 
				issue<br><br>• A range of governance models might be developed so that the 
				staff feels comfort that is has the framework for oversight but 
				that the organization is encouraged to develop the most 
				effective model of leadership transfusion that fits their 
				objectives<br><br>• I think it might just be the fear at the present time that 
				“RI” does not know what the RAGs and Fellowship groups are doing 
				so have a latent fear that they might be doing something that 
				could prejudice RI. This fear is largely unfounded. <br></font>
				<br>The nominating committee for their officers is appointed by 
				their President. Provided these officers are active Rotarians, 
				the RI Board has no ability to remove them even if there are 
				issues of breaking RI policies, personal taint or unsatisfactory 
				performance.<br><br><font color="#800000">• These issues can all be dealt with by the Code if thought 
				necessary.<br><br>• This situation is covered by s. 43.020.2. Termination can be 
				ordered pursuant to s. 43.020.4<br><br>• A standard “criteria” could be developed as I suggested a year 
				ago to then RIPE Stenhammar and the G/S (see my email of July 
				15, 2006)<br><br>• Do we not trust our clubs and districts to chose our leaders? 
				Why should this be different from other Rotary entities??<br>
				<br>• Rotarians are chosen because of their business and integrity 
				reputations. That is the premise and context (just like in 
				clubs) upon which any new policy in this area should be 
				attempted<br></font><br><br>There would appear to be no way for the RI Board or the General 
				Secretary to address<br>partnerships formed with undesirable organizations or 
				individuals provided that the<br>amount of each transaction is less than $25.000.<br>
				<br><font color="#800000">• We don’t require this of clubs – RAGs should be subject to the 
				same trust and under the same direction<br><br>• This situation is governed by s. 43.020.4 (i.e if the 
				partnership breaks a RAG policy or is inconsistent with the 
				cooperative relationship policy, prohibitions against religious 
				or political involvement etc.) and 43.020.12 (statement of 
				disassociation from RI requirement) , then they should be 
				sanctioned with the possibility of forfeiture of recognition.<br>
				<br>• This concern appears to come from those who want, for good 
				reason, to separate the activities of the “corporate RI” from 
				the activities of clubs, districts and “Rotary Entities”. This 
				is a valid concern and is addressed in several places in the 
				Code. In this context the separation requirements are found in 
				s. 43.020.11<br><br>• The limitation is actually covered in s 43.020.15 of the Code. 
				If this needs to be tightened to allow for a “re-action time” by 
				RI (if thought necessary), it could be amended by providing that 
				the Board (G/S acting on its behalf) could require details of 
				the plan, proposed cooperating entity and 3/p recipient of funds 
				so as to protect the Board against unsavory relationships. The 
				G/S would have to have a specific mandate from the Board to 
				apply a criteria that would be part of the defining criteria in 
				the approval process (as I suggested to the G/S and then RIPE 
				Stenhammar a year ago.)<br><br>• this is speculative and surely not consistent with what 
				motivates Rotarians to “do good in the world” )<br></font><br>
				<font color="#800000">• s. 43.020.15 deals with the conflict of interest and fund 
				raising issues in cooperative relationships<br></font><br><br>
				<br>As these groups are basically independent but can use the term 
				Rotarian, what<br>expectations will outside bodies have of them, particularly if 
				they operate unethically or<br>inefficiently?<br><br>
				<font color="#800000">• The simple answer is “the same as any Rotary Club”<br>
				<br>• Our current rules adequately cover this situation<br><br>• This seems to be a lightning rod question posed by a staff 
				member who covets control of all Rotarian Activity and does not 
				understand the basis upon which Rotarians are chosen to become 
				Rotarians or the deeply held conviction that we can “trust” 
				Rotarians as business and professional leaders. We have seen, 
				fortunately, very few exceptions to this but they get attention.<br>
				<br>• the groups are as independent as the policy permits them to 
				be- just as Clubs are autonomous, they must conform to policies 
				set out in the constitutional documents and Code of Policies</font><br>
				<br>How do they control their own members? <br><br>
				<font color="#800000">• The same way as Clubs do their members<br>
				</font><br>We recently received an e-mail which told RI<br>that we have partnerships with Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Proctor 
				and Gamble.<br><br><font color="#800000">• I find this hard to believe?? The committee might wish to see 
				a copy of the letter. From who did the email come Coca Cola?? 
				What are the terms of the RI contract?? Who are the signatories? 
				How can RI be involved in a contract of which it knows nothing – 
				this seems impossible! If it is true, steps should be taken to 
				ensure compliance with the code. <br><br>• This is a misleading statement – it is the kind of statement I 
				heard from risk management people on staff and when examined 
				carefully, the concern turned out to be based on presumption and 
				speculation and not facts. </font><br><br>The Board has not approved any of these partnerships, and the 
				action of the RAG could<br>preclude the Board and or the Trustees from global partnerships 
				with these major<br>companies. Such partnerships should benefit the whole 
				organisation rather than one<br>specific group.<br><br>
				<font color="#800000">• Question – what does it mean: ---“whole organization”? If it 
				means Corporate RI, there is a serious disconnect from the view 
				that RI consists of Rotary Clubs and not the buracracy and Board 
				of Directors in Evanston <br><br>• RI and TRF are not in the business of creating global 
				partnerships. There is only one program (Polio Plus) that Rotary 
				will recognize as a global program so it is impossible for this 
				to happen at this time.<br><br>• There is not one dollar that has gone to a RAG from an outside 
				source that I am aware of that would have gone to corporate RI. 
				RI is simply not in this business! Neither is the Foundation. 
				With exception of public appeals from TRF for Polio, TRF is 
				supported by individual Rotarians and clubs – not global 
				partnerships (i.e we have never asked Coca Cola to give money to 
				the Foundation to support our GSE teams – nor would they likely 
				do this even if approached)!!<br><br>• There is a clear policy within Rotary that does not allow 
				partnerships to evolve other than on very specific terms and for 
				specific purposes with specific prohibitions (see s. 35.010 Code 
				of Policies).<br><br>• I cannot believe that a RAG entered into a contract with an 
				organization on behalf of Rotary International. Surely we would 
				have heard about this!!?<br><br>• The underlying theme here is that RI and the whole Rotary 
				world could benefit from these (indirectly) and in fact DOES 
				benefit because of the public relations enhancement, increased 
				membership, focused and effective WCS associated with Rotary.<br>
				<br>Over recent years, the Board and President have appointed Task 
				Forces or Resource<br>Groups to promote the emphasis developed by the President. 
				<br><br>• There has been much debate over the years about the President 
				doing this and most have varied in their approach. It has been 
				refreshing in the past 4 years to have had some consistency in 
				the “emphasis”<br><br>• It must be pointed out that these are generally NOT areas of 
				emphasis that have been arbitrarily dreamed up by Presidents. 
				They typically have simply emphasized one of more of the items 
				from the Menu of Service Opportunities and asked clubs to 
				particularly focus on these; i.e.<br>&#61607; Environment - water management emphasis<br>&#61607; Health concerns<br>&#61607; Education and literacy</font><br>
				<br><br><font color="#800000">As Director, Horst Heiner Hellge recently opined:<br>
				<br>“ --- it's not just the system of fellowships and RAG's, it's 
				the enormous unsolved problem of estabishing a new concept - 
				able to take load - for all these disordered international and 
				President-focussed functions like resource groups, task forces, 
				&quot;coordinators&quot; of all sorts, entities that are not in harmony 
				with each other and even less with district functions and the 
				authority of autonomous clubs and their by laws.”<br></font><br>
				<font color="#800000">• RAGs have the potential of continuing the emphasis in 
				meaningful and effective ways long after the year of a 
				particular President By building on the strengths generated by 
				the President focusing on the particular area in which the RAG 
				is working, world attention is focused on the service area. This 
				could be a very positive connection. <br><br>• It also emphasizes that RAGs are expected to work through the 
				Clubs and therefore, with the President’s support in his 
				emphasis, the ability of the Rotary world to do better service 
				by building greater expertise and capacity is enhanced.<br><br>• A major concerns is lack of continuity. Resource Groupls exist 
				only at the<br>pleasure of the President.<br><br>• They have no authority to support long-term initiatives:- 
				despite our<br>ability to generate much interest and enthusiasm Rotarians have 
				no<br>assurance of continued interest or support. Consequently they 
				are<br>unwilling to initiate truly significant programmes. They remain 
				short-term, project-focused with few exceptions<br><br>• People are appointed to resource groups who may have no 
				interest in<br>the subject but accept the invitation solely to raise their 
				political<br>profile in Rotary.</font><br><br>
				<font color="#800000">• Major NGOs and agencies e.g. Unicef, UNESCO, WaterAid, etc 
				look to<br>Rotary for leadership at the grass-roots level. At present it is<br>difficult for a resource to make any commitment except promising 
				to<br>communicate and encouraging. We risk becoming marginalised in 
				the major <br>humanitarian issues of the day.<br>• </font><br>
				<br><br>These Resource Groups have their membership appointed from the 
				list of Rotarians submitted by Rotary senior leaders, and they 
				are answerable to the Board and President. Each year their 
				General Coordinator and Assistant Coordinator receive training 
				from RI, and are told of their mission. RAGs do not have those 
				constraints. Is there any future for Resource Groups?<br><br>
				<font color="#800000">This thoughtful question begs a thoughtful response and much 
				time dedicated to it by the committee.<br><br>Recognition of a Rotarian Action Group requires a very careful 
				policy and administrative framework. The Board, in June 2005 
				went a long way in articulation this. Some issues were 
				overlooked. Because I brought this program proposal to the Board 
				in the first place, I continued to provide input. Last August, I 
				made the suggestion to President Carl-Wilhelm and the G/S (based 
				on the materials we developed in Committee) as to how this 
				recognition process might unfold. Certainly, my Board 
				Administration Committee focused on this before making the 
				recommendation to the Programs Committee and to the Board. We 
				reviewed, in detail, the way in which this distinction between 
				the Concern for Health (now the Water, Health and Hunger 
				Concerns Resource Group) was mandated and how the RAGs would be 
				structured. Obviously, the Board was satisfied with it<br><br>This question is good also because it begs the distinction 
				between what RI is expected to do (i.e. in the language of the 
				Resource Group mandate: &quot;This resource group will work to 
				increase awareness ---provide information -----etc.&quot;) This is 
				not the kind of mandate under which a RAG functions.<br><br>• Sometimes, if not mostly, there is no demand from clubs for 
				information from resource groups. <br><br>• Clubs are not enough engaged in WCS. RAGs are motivating and 
				mobilizing them. Resource Groups mostly wait until they are 
				asked by clubs but they are not! Clubs simply do not “connect” 
				with the Resource Groups and indeed I suspect that 98% of the 
				Rotary world does not even know they exist<br><br>• A Rotarian Action Group would not be expected to duplicate the 
				mandate of a Resource Group although it may well have similar 
				capacity in certain very focused ways (i.e developing 
				operational protocols for a health Fair, as compared to 
				informing Clubs that a Health Fair is a possible way of doing a 
				local health Community project) <br><br>• Information (if forthcoming at all) from a Resource Group to a 
				Club is not enough. Hardly anything will happen after the 
				information is given especially if the information is not based 
				on club driven experience. <br><br>• An Action group is required by its policy framework to work 
				through the clubs and districts - the Rotary network. Yes, an 
				Action Group may very well make use of information that comes 
				from the Resource Group but of more interest (subject to the 
				criteria used to recognize them), they would have a much higher 
				level of applied expertise and focus then what we have seen in 
				Resource Groups<br><br>• RAGs are made of up of volunteers who are highly dedicated and 
				engaged. They have a very restricted and focused mission and 
				mandate based on activity (“ACTION”). Would it not be useful to 
				have a district member for each Rotarian Action group??<br><br>• Resource Groups lack a detailed &quot;job description&quot; that 
				inspires and “leads” a member to actually “do anything”. Indeed, 
				there is evidence that the Board or President will be critical 
				if the Resource group actually does something! Witness, the 
				grief that was provided the World Community Service Committee 
				(Resource Group) in 2005 just because it wanted to &quot;do 
				something&quot; - i.e. host a meeting in Cairo! The committee and its 
				chairman was embarrassed and criticized for “actually doing 
				something” that would increase the ability of clubs to perform 
				quality world community service. Their report was not even 
				permitted to be recognized as anything but a local undertaking 
				even though dozen of countries were represented at the meeting! 
				The Board never officially received its report! The conference 
				was considered only as an “unofficial meeting”.<br><br>• It was perhaps this latter point that has prompted so many 
				Rotarians to create the many proliferating &quot;cause related&quot; 
				Rotarian based entities and ignore the Resource groups, 
				Committees and Task Forces as being ineffective and simply a way 
				to allow appointments to be made and names to appear in the OD 
				but not really expecting these groups to accomplish anything of 
				real value in the service and fellowship mandate called for in 
				the Object of Rotary<br><br>• On the last point – RAGS are definitely “answerable” to the 
				board (indeed far more so than Resource Committees) by the 
				provisions of s 40 of the Code of Policies. <br><br>• Resource Groups on the other hand are not responsible for 
				reporting to anyone and certainly not the Board. The Chair 
				historically has reported to the president but the reports do 
				not come to the Board and there does not seem to be any 
				mechanism built into their mandate to either receive 
				quantitative or qualitative reports that would report on their 
				yearly activities or their effectiveness. (sometimes, proactive 
				Chairs get their picture in the “Rotarian” with a story about 
				what some club or Rotary Group has accomplished but that is 
				quite different from having a policy framework that sets out a 
				specific mandate and a requirement to report to the Board as the 
				question implies. They should be applauded for this but it the 
				exception rather than the rule. While some Chairpersons are 
				hyper active and visible in some projects, there is little if 
				any connection between the mandate of the Resource Group itself 
				and the actual WCS being done.<br><br>• Certainly, it would be of value to have RAGs leadership get 
				training from RI (just as do the coordinators of Resource 
				Groups). I feel certain that the RAGs would endorse this 
				opportunity. The training would have to be well defined and 
				perhaps would focus on :<br><br>o Risk management vis a vis RI<br>o Official Marks policies<br>o RAG Code of Policy up-dates and training on “expectations”<br>o Training on the principals of effective “Results Based 
				Management” in International Development as already some 
				multi-district activities provide their club leaders<br>o Cooperative relationship policies<br>o TRF liaison on how RAGs can effectively work through the RIN 
				(Rotary International Network) in applying the “Rotary Model” in 
				their WCS<br>o Special rules related to RAG and multi-club applications for 
				matching grants and 3-H grants<br>o Etc.</font><br><br>Is there any point in a President having emphases if the RAGs 
				are operating<br>independently and supplant Resource Groups?<br>
				<br><font color="#800000">Yes, there is a future for Resource Groups – they are called 
				Rotarian Action Groups. In other words, why not consider the 
				possibility of a positive working relationship and recognition 
				of RAGs as a way in which a President can implement his own 
				priorities.<br><br>&#61607; by appointing a liaison director or small liaison committee 
				made up of special Rotarians with specialized interest in the 
				activity of the RAG, to be the Presidential interface with the 
				activities of these groups. Governors could be trained to 
				understand the work of RAGs and appoint a district 
				representative to be the liaison with the cause specific RAGs
				<br><br>&#61607; Think of the tremendous potential that these groups would have 
				if the President asked DG’s to appoint district representatives 
				to the Menu of Service Opportunity priorities and how the clubs 
				would then have a direct way of helping to provide WCS through 
				these “Resource Rags”. <br><br>&#61607; In the context of International service, this is a legitimate 
				question but goes to the oft-criticized matter (that has found 
				its way to the COL on a number of occasions) of continuity of 
				purpose. There is a valid view that to change our emphasis year 
				after year, we do a disservice to the long-term program focus 
				needed (as per our Strategic Plan) to enhance our public image 
				and effectiveness. <br><br>&#61607; Fortunately, in this regard, recent Presidents have recognized 
				this fact and have “stayed the course” with literacy, 
				environment (water) and health. If we had a RAG in each, the 
				President could work directly through this group of expert 
				Rotarians who work with the clubs to become the face of Rotary 
				on the ground – just like the mobilized Club Rotarians who set 
				up the immunization clinic in the village – working under an 
				international master plan and guided by the leaders of the 
				Action Group since RI itself does not have these expertise in 
				house. (In this vision, it is easy to see why the recognition 
				criteria for the approval of a RAG is necessarily more rigorous 
				than an application to become a Fellowship Group.) <br></font>
				<br><br>How should RAGs interface with clubs and districts? <br>
				<br><font color="#800000">This is the “Rotary Model” as expanded upon by Bob Scott in the 
				July Rotarian. And, it makes good sense! The existing RAGs and 
				multi-district activity groups are already doing this! This is 
				the real value of the RIN. The best example of course is the 
				structure of the Polio Plus program.<br></font><br><br>Currently each district is encouraged to appoint a Resource 
				Group chair so that the District Governor is not inundated with 
				requests and approaches to clubs are channeled through one 
				individual.<br><br><font color="#800000">&#61607; In truth, I have not seen this since 1993 (when President 
				Cliff Dochterman mandated this to DGs. Presidents Bhichae 
				Rattakul and Frank Devlyn did the same except on a lesser scale. 
				As an international training leader for two years and a zone 
				trainer for 4 years, I recall only these Presidents between 1992 
				and 2003 who have asked DGs to do this. I doubt if DGs are 
				trained to do this now. You may have different information.<br>
				<br>&#61607; To say the least, this direction is sporatic and inconsistent. 
				A permanent direction of appointment of this kind (connecting 
				with the activity group) would lead to better results as 
				successive DG’s become aware of the necessity of making these 
				appointments </font><br><br>RAGs can approach Rotarians, clubs and districts independently. 
				As they grow in<br>number, how do clubs and districts cope? <br>
				<br><font color="#800000">&#61607; At the moment, in WCS, most projects are generated by a club 
				member being inspired by a personal contact, acting on an 
				unsolicited approach from another club of seeking a project 
				though one of the many channels available to it. This would not 
				change.<br><br>&#61607; The reality is that for most clubs in donor countries, only a 
				very few individual Rotarians become engaged in international 
				service. It is usually these individuals who act and speak for 
				the clubs. The club works through these people on the WCS 
				Committee so the club need not feel overwhelmed by any desire by 
				the committee to lead it into a proliferation of “causes” as the 
				question implies. The club would continue to have the autonomy 
				to do whatever it wants in WCS<br><br>&#61607; The growth in numbers and quality of programs would simply be 
				another source of information on ways in which the club could 
				engage in WCS. The difference here is that by connecting to the 
				larger initiative, with greater HR, a targeted WCS issues and 
				financial capacity, the potential for a more sustainable program 
				is possible. This is also consistent with better results based 
				international development principals. <br></font><br>Will they take over World Community<br>Service?<br>
				<font color="#800000">I am not sure what this means but it appears to be an emotive 
				staff driven question that simply raise the rhetoric and 
				emotional response to negative speculative change. No one and no 
				Rotary organization would “take over” WCS. Did the TRF “take 
				over” the polio initiative? No! But, by focusing the club 
				activity and fundraising through this Rotary entity (TRF), 
				Rotary has succeeded in many many ways!<br></font><br><br>The impact on The Rotary Foundation is concerning the Trustees. 
				By approaching<br>potential partners of TRF, are RAGs diverting funds from TRF? 
				More importantly, as<br>they solicit funds from individual Rotarians, or DDF, will they 
				impact on Rotarian giving<br>to the Foundation?<br><br>
				<font color="#800000">&#61607; TRF is not structured to seek money for specific WCS causes 
				(Polio Plus is the exception)<br><br>&#61607; TRF does not manage or promote any specific projects or 
				programs (other than Polio) for which it goes to non-Rotarians 
				for money (it tried through PRIP Jim Lacie, but failed)<br><br>&#61607; The organizations and people that give money to RAGs give 
				money because these Action Groups address causes in which they 
				are interested and prepared o support. TRF does not have a 
				mechanism nor would there be, in my opinion, any reason why the 
				Packard Foundation or the World Bank or Coco-Cola would give RI 
				any money to provide Ambassadorial Scholarships! On the other 
				hand, when the Gates Foundation was asked to participate in the 
				specific cause of polio irradication, a major amount of money 
				was contributes!<br><br>&#61607; There is no evidence to suggest that there is a diversion of 
				funds taking place.<br><br>&#61607; It has been reported that the Shelter Box Program of Great 
				Britain raised 11 million dollars in about 4 months in the name 
				of Rotary to contribute to Tsunami relief. It has raised over 
				2.5 Million for the Pakistan earthquake relief delivery of 
				shelters. The Fellowship for Fighting Aids has generated over 8 
				million dollars to fight Aids in Africa. If these groups had 
				been recognized by Rotary as Rotary Action Groups and supported 
				by the Foundation, might these publicly raised funds have gone 
				through the Foundation? Perhaps! Whether of not this would have 
				happened, there is enormous potential for similar success 
				stories now to be incorporated directly in the new Rotary 
				program allowed by the Global Networking Groups. The potential 
				is unfathomable. But, a positive and coordinated collaboration 
				between RI, TRF and the Action Groups will be required. This is 
				a major planning initiative but worthwhile considering (perhaps 
				as a pilot project). An incremental strategy would be necessary.
				<br></font><br>If they approach TRF for program funding, probably through the 
				clubs of enthusiastic<br>and committed RAG members, how should TRF. Respond?<br>
				<br><font color="#800000">Perhaps the day will come when some of the Rotary Action Groups 
				(RAGs) will catch the eye of the Foundation Trustees. Like a 
				“Rag Rug” to which many people and resources contribute to 
				produce a beautiful and functional mosaic, it is not 
				inconceivable that the service being done by a RAG is of such 
				note as to think that the Rotary Foundation will regard them as 
				an attractive potential service partner. <br><br>&#61607; A matching grant perhaps? 
				<br><br>&#61607; A restricted fund? <br><br>&#61607; A donor-advised fund? 
				<br><br>&#61607; A policy that could allow for funds raised in the name of 
				Rotary by the RAG might flow through the Foundation and allow 
				for the engaging of staff professionals who are tasked to manage 
				or work on specific programs initiated by the Action Group? Why 
				not? This would be a win-win for both and make the balance sheet 
				of the Foundation look that much better. <br><br>&#61607; Clearly, those submitting the RAGS application for recognition 
				have to consider very carefully how to distinguish the RAGs 
				initiative from the good work that can be done through the 
				Foundation and ensure no conflict. <br><br>&#61607; It is fair to say that TRF is not structured to be in the same 
				business as is contemplated by the Disaster Relief RAG 
				application. <br><br>&#61607; For example, the DRRAG (disaster relief RAG proposal) could 
				and should be of assistance to clubs who are utilizing TRF 
				funding and working through the Rotary channels (RIN). This is 
				already covered in Board policy. But, I see nothing in the TRF 
				or Board initiative that helps with the question of how to 
				position Rotary as a Disaster relief organization (nor do I 
				think it should be). The point is that a DRRAG has the capacity 
				that TRF does not have. That is, to work within the framework of 
				the SPHERE Project and provide the guidance that our clubs and 
				districts will need in determining how to best provide the 
				emergency response.<br><br>&#61607; SPHERE is a good example of where Rotary has fallen down on 
				disaster relief and is not seen as a world player because it is 
				not itself “qualified” under this international standard. The 
				Board could insist that a RAG carrying out this specific service 
				function under the Rotary banner be so certified.<br></font><br>
				<br>There are some administration issues. Who will monitor the 
				performance and standards<br>of each RAG? <br><br>
				<font color="#800000">&#61607; In my view, the issue of a RAG in this or any other initiative 
				is a product of an appropriate guideline (or recognition 
				criteria) established within the policies of Rotary to assure 
				Rotary that this approved Rotary entity has the credentials to 
				act in the name of Rotary in these specialized areas (just as 
				Rotary has developed the expertise in working with our partners 
				in the Polio initiative. The potential scope is of similar 
				proportions). I tried to convince our past President and G/S to 
				revisit this recognition criteria - without success. <br><br>&#61607; The degree of guidance to be provided by the RI Board over the 
				next few years will be a function of the quality of organization 
				that develops in each Rotary Action Group. The staff will have 
				to be guided by and implement the policy<br><br>&#61607; The level of acceptable “behavior” and organizational 
				integrity of these emerging groups of Rotarians will predict the 
				extent of the oversight required. At a well-attended workshop at 
				the Centennial Convention participants cited a primary goal of 
				having Action Groups undertake WCS programs that are consistent 
				with the Rotary areas of emphasis and the Millennium Goals. 
				Clearly the development of organizational and managerial 
				capacity is a necessary starting point.<br><br>&#61607; Undertaking a programmatic approach to international 
				development is preferential to a project-by-project approach. 
				The TRF trustees have discovered this though the KPMG report. 
				The measurable results must necessarily tie into the poverty 
				reduction strategies of the countries and the sectors in which 
				the Action Group is focusing its attention. The cost of 
				administration for small projects is a concern. RAGs can be part 
				of this solution<br><br>&#61607; Rotary Action Groups have the potential to “behave” like 
				operational NGO’s and perform in a much more effective manner 
				because of the relationships that can be built through the club 
				and district networks. <br></font><br>What are the staff implications for RI?<br>
				<br><font color="#800000">&#61607; At the moment, the staff implications are benign but that is 
				because the application process is benign. <br><br>&#61607; If a recommendation is made that requires a much more 
				intensive and rigorous recognition criteria, then the staff will 
				have to spend more time on the process than it presently does 
				with Fellowship Groups. <br><br>&#61607; At the same time, if the President accepts the notion of a 
				RAGs Resource Committee to which much of this specialized 
				understanding is delegated, then this effective committee could 
				take up much of the load in working with the RAG applications 
				and even get into policy compliance oversight.<br></font><br>It is a fact that a number of RAGs already exist, and a couple 
				of senior Rotary leaders are enthusiastically encouraging 
				Rotarians to establish more and more.<br><br>
				<font color="#800000">&#61607; There is no doubt that this vision is catching the imagination 
				of the Rotary world but it is not because of “promotion” by 
				Rotary leaders. <br><br>&#61607; It is because this service delivery model makes sense and 
				Rotarians like the idea of being able to connect with other 
				Rotarians – from other clubs around the world - with similar 
				interest, talents and determination to do a specific kind of 
				WCS. <br><br>&#61607; They work in their clubs but they use the contact and capacity 
				of the larger more specialized interest group of Rotarians to 
				implement International Service in a more congruent manner<br>
				</font><br>Currently RAGs are required to have an AGM at the International 
				Convention, with<br>meeting space provided free by R.L We currently have some 15 
				additional RAGs who<br>have either applied or are preparing applications. As the number 
				of RAGs increases,<br>what are the implications for the Convention?<br>
				<br><font color="#800000">&#61607; Firstly, the numbers of convention goers increases!<br>
				<br>&#61607; The number of display booths increases in the House of 
				Friendship<br><br>&#61607; The programs and expertise found within the RAGs could be 
				engaged to run discussion groups on particular programs (i.e 
				HIV/AIDS; Children at Risk, Malaria, Land Mines etc.) <br><br>&#61607; Secondly, there is great value in having these meetings taking 
				place, Indeed, for a RAG - perhaps it should be mandatory. This 
				is now happening anyway!<br><br>&#61607; The venue can be used to undertake some of the RI oversight 
				referred to above.<br><br>&#61607; Such on opportunity also exposes the rest of the Rotary world

				Rotarian Action Groups</font><br><br><br>One of the current Groups, having acknowledged the need to 
				complete polio eradication,<br>is saying that action can now be taken to &quot;assess/cajole

				humanitarian WCS sector? <br><br>&#61607; It would be hoped at an applicant would provide evidence that 
				it has canvassed and attempted to include all of the known 
				Rotary groups currently involved in the service area 
				(humanitarian sector) so as to ensure a broadly based discussion 
				among Rotarians on issues of &quot;best practice&quot; and the important 
				linkages that are necessary to tackle any world wide problem in 
				a congruent way. <br><br>&#61607; If you use Polio Plus as a modal pyramid of Rotary 
				connectedness, you can see that any RAG may have country 
				coordinators, District Committees and club liaison, RAG Partner 
				Groups (like Polio Plus Partners), and the many Rotary, 
				government and interagency partnerships that the RAG application 
				contemplates. <br><br>&#61607; A rigorous application process has the potential of 
				identifying long-term results that would be the norm for a 
				visionary and well researched, written and comprehensive 
				recognition submission. It would be hoped that there would be 
				only one Rotarian Action Group providing this global leadership 
				in any one area of WCS. (not unlike the division that exists in 
				Resource groups). But the RAG (say, Environment, might have a 
				number of subsets i.e. water, forestry, recycling etc.)<br><br>&#61607; RAGs exist because Rotarians with a passion for a cause want 
				the opportunity to promote their special interest within Rotary. 
				The challenge is to enable this to happen without the Board 
				losing its ability to ensure the integrity of every group and 
				program that carries the name of Rotary. <br><br>As Director, Horst Heiner Hellge recently opined:
				<br><br>------- “I am attaching great value and importance to the 
				results and proposals of our RAG Committee and I hope they'll 
				work really quickly. This Committee has quite different terms of 
				reference than other committees which gives this committee an 
				even higher rank and importance. I am optimistic and quite 
				confident that our RAG baby will see a good future if we are 
				really looking after it and taking care of its future functions 
				and authorities.”</font><br><br><br>Best regards,<br>W. B. &quot;Bill&quot; Boyd<br>President-Elect, Rotary International<br>cc:2006-07 Board of Directors. Rotary International<br>
