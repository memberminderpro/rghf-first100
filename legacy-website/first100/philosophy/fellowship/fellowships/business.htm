		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19"  width: 1050px;>For decades, 
		Rotary frowned upon mixing business with the good deeds that Rotarians 
		often performed. That idea conflicted with the fact that Rotary was 
		started in 1905 as a business networking club.<br><br>It was not until 
		the mid-2000’s that individual Rotary clubs began to feel comfortable 
		about integrating business networking back into the Rotary World.<br>
		<br>The very first Rotary Means Business group was founded by Rotary 
		Club of San Francisco in 2004. This caught the attention of the District 
		5150 Governor, who encouraged suburban clubs in the District to form 
		their own Rotary Means Business group. In 2005, both the Peninsula 
		(south suburbs) and Marin (north suburbs) Rotary Means Business groups 
		were formed.<br><br>Rotary Means Business came to Sonoma County in 2009 
		thru the efforts of members of the Rotary Club of Santa Rosa. Expansion 
		of the Rotary Means Business concept was strongly supported by District 
		Governors Jim Lampson and Maureen Merrill, so the local Santa Rosa group 
		expanded to encompass the entire county. The leaders of the local RMB 
		group also presented the concepts to other Rotary clubs from Ukiah to 
		Los Gatos, and as far east as Reno.<br><br>The Sonoma County Rotary 
		Means Business group also created a website and member directory, which 
		began to attract members worldwide. Within a year, RMB had members from 
		Italy, India, Australia, and more. <br><br>The leaders of the local RMB 
		group realized that Rotary Means Business had a worldwide potential. So, 
		in early 2012, a Steering Committee was formed to develop all the 
		necessary documentation that Rotary would require to approve an 
		International Fellowship.<br><br>Before submitting the documentation to 
		Rotary International, the steering committee sought guidance from some 
		past District Governors as to how to approach Rotary International. More 
		than one PDG advised them to defer approaching Rotary International, as 
		the general feeling was that RI was not quite ready to welcome a 
		business-oriented Fellowship. <br><br>By early 2013, over 300 Rotarians 
		from all over the world had signed up to the 
		<a href="http://www.RotaryMeansBusiness.org" target="_blank">www.RotaryMeansBusiness.org</a> 
		website. Rotarians in India had offered to create smartphone apps for 
		iPhone and Android. So Rotary Means Business was growing to a worldwide 
		presence, even without full approval of RI.<br><br>With RMB growing 
		organically, it was only a matter of time before RMB would gather the 
		attention of Rotary International. In March of 2013, the webmaster at 
		Rotary Means Business received a communication from RI inquiring about 
		the Rotary Means Business concept.<br><br>This communication opened the 
		door for the local RMB group to apply for Fellowship approval. Because 
		much of the documentation had been prepared in advance, the application 
		process went very smoothly.<br><br>In early November, Rotary Means 
		Business was approved as the newest Fellowship of Rotary International. 
		District 5130, in Northern California, can point with pride to an 
		international organization that was grown from very small roots, 
		nurtured, and allowed to flower as way to unite Rotarians from all over 
		the world.<br><br>Upon receiving approval as an official Fellowship, RMB 
		secured a booth in the House of Friendship at the 2014 Rotary 
		International Convention in Sydney, Australia. The Chair of the newly 
		approved Fellowship, Mark Burchill, was invited to speak at the 
		Fellowship breakout at the convention. The Sydney convention yielded 65 
		new RMB members.<br><br>Over the next two years, the Rotary Means 
		Business Fellowship continued to grow, primarily from the grassroots 
		level. Groups of Rotarians all over the globe heard of the concept and 
		contacted the RMB Fellowship for guidance in creating their local 
		chapters of the Rotary Means Business Fellowship.<br><br>By July of 
		2016, the Rotary Means Business Fellowship had more than 300 members, in 
		more than 30 countries. The Fellowship had 27 local chapters, on every 
		continent except Antarctica. <br><br>Clearly, the concept of Rotary 
		Means Business struck a chord with Rotarians world wide. <br><br>For 
		more information, contact Mark Burchill, Chair, at
