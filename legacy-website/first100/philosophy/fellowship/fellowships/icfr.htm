		The International Chess Fellowship of Rotarians (ICFR), an entertaining 
		and challenging Fellowship authorized by the Rotary International, is 
		organized and exists to promote the international spirit of Rotary and 
		the enjoyment of chess through correspondence chess play among 
		interested Rotarians. ICFR members share a mutual love of chess and an 
		interest in the personal and cultural activities of fellow members 
		through individual correspondence, articles and games published in the 
		ICFR’s semiannual “The Chessarian” newsletter, and personal fellowship 
		and play both at the annual Rotary International conventions and during 
		personal visits to the homes of fellow ICFR members. <br><br>The ICFR 
		has been in continuous existence since 1977. Paul Rosamond ( Dallas-Fair 
		Park, Texas, USA) reactivated the dormant ICFR that year, accepting the 
		personal challenge by the Coordinator of Rotary International World 
		Fellowship Activities at the 1977 Rotary International convention in San 
		Francisco, California (USA). As chairman, Paul took quick action to 
		energize and build ICFR. He recruited 2 local non-Rotarian businessmen 
		into his Fair Park Rotary Club to assist him with the ICFR. These 
		men-Wayne Connaway ( ICFR Editor) and James Campion (ICR Secretary) 
		brought considerable experience to the ICFR. Both had a long affiliation 
		with the Dallas Chess Club-Connaway serving both as its President and 
		Newsletter Editor and Campion (past winner of the Dallas Chess 
		Championship) serving at its Treasurer. Rosamond’s small team contacted 
		and reactivated dozens of past members, established Regional Vice 
		Chairmanships (RVC’s) to promote the ICFR throughout the US and 
		worldwide, and began correspondence play-Paul Rosamond personally 
		beginning correspondence with 24 partners.<br><br>By April, 1979, the 
		newly energized ICFR published its first issue of “The Chessarian” as a 
		single 2-sided sheet. Making their featured debuts were the first 
		completed ICFR correspondence game (Kauffman v. Rosamond) and the first 
		chess puzzle (mate in 3). In addition, the new leadership used this 
		inaugural issue to state their vision of the ICFR mission, set 
		aggressive goals for the ICFR, and recognize the growing leadership.<br>
		<br>The ICFR mission was stated as serving as “an instrument of Rotary 
		to promote and encourage worldwide fellowship among Rotarians while 
		enjoying the age old Royal Game of Chess.”<br><br>The young organization 
		established several aggressive goals, including:<br>1. To keep the ICFR 
		sound through periodic request of small annual contributions;<br>2. To 
		regularly publish “The Chessarian” both as a fun way for all current 
		ICFR members to keep involved and to help promote new membership growth;<br>
		3. To establish correspondence chess ratings or rankings fro active 
		players;<br>4. To periodically use a portion of contributed funds to 
		award a Paul Harris Fellowship to the best submitted correspondence game 
		by any eligible player as funds become available; and<br>5. To organize 
		and conduct a variety of chess activities at annual RI conventions 
		worldwide for enjoyment and fellowship, and to promote ICFR membership.<br>
		<br>Highlighting the further growth the ICFR leadership, “The 
		Chessarian” recognized 5 new US RVC’s and 5 pending RVC’s in the 
		Bahamas, Costa Rica, India, the Philippines, and the UK.<br><br>The 
		soundness of the vision and leadership is demonstrated both by the 
		continued enthusiasm of the ICFR membership over the years and by the 
		remarkable success of the organization in each of these 3 areas. The 
		ICFR has stayed true to its fellowship mission since 1979 and has had 
		the good fortune of seeing its stated goals largely and regularly met.<br>
		<br>The ICFR remained on a sound financial footing over the years. 
		Starting with no treasury, the ICFR initially funded its activities 
		through personal investment by the first officers. The ICFR has been 
		kept sound over the years by both the regular contributions and 
		continued invaluable support personal support. Of particular note are 
		ICFR member (and “The Chessarian” printer) Don Powell ( El Paso, 
		Texas,USA) and the many ICFR officers and members who have travelled to 
		the RI conventions throughout the world, staffing booths and organizing 
		and sponsoring tournament play.<br><br>“The Chessarian” continues to be 
		published each year (May and November) and has expanded to 4-6 pages per 
		issue. Each issue continues to showcase a number of submitted 
		correspondence games, several mind-bending chess puzzles, and several 
		interesting articles.<br><br>Responding to membership interest Herbert 
		Punchard ( first ICFR Game Recorder) began publishing a simple ranking 
		of each submittingyer’s accumulated win-loss-tie percentage in “The 
		Chessarian.” The ranking continues to be updated and published in most 
		issues as room permits.<br><br>The awarding of a Paul Harris Fellowship 
		to a qualified ICFR member for his best-submitted correspondence game is 
		still a goal and will be realized as funds permit.<br><br>The ICFR has 
		been a regular presence at RI conventions over the years, hosting booths 
		at most all of the US sited conventions( e.g. Chicago, Dallas, 
		Indianapolis, Orlando, Philadelphia, and Portland) and many of the 
		internationally sited conventions (e.g. Buenos Aires, Calgary, Glasgow, 
		Melbourne, Mexico City, Nice, and Seoul). To promote interest, the ICFR 
		has hosted simultaneous exhibitions at several conventions (e.g. Chicago 
		and Philadelphia). A number of round-robin over-the-board tournaments 
		have been held at RI conventions (e.g. Calgary, Dallas, Glasgow, 
		Indianapolis, and Nice). Convention activity has proven successful in 
		promoting interest in the ICFR. For example, the ICFR received 91 
		inquiries and gained 26 new members in the 11 months following 
		convention in Seoul, South Korea. An additional 15 new members joined 
		following the Portland, Oregon (USA) convention in 1990. <br><br>As the 
		leadership grew, so did the membership. The initial officers were joined 
		by 10 actual and pending Regional Vice Chairmen in less than 2 years, 
		and an additional 6 Regional Vice Chairmen 8 months later. From its 
		membership base in the late 1970’s, ICFR membership quickly expanded 
		internationally. By 1998, the ICFR boasted 101 members in 16 countries 
		around the world, balancing its 54 US members with 47 international 
		members. Internationally, Canada led in membership in 1998 with 12 ( 6 
		British Columbia, 4 Ontario and 2 Alberta), followed by the UK with 10 ( 
		8 England, and 2 Scotland), India with 9, and France with 4. In 1998, 
		ICFR membership in the US came from 27 states, led by California with 6, 
		Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia with 4 each, and New York and Oklahoma 
		with 3 each.<br><br>The ICFR has proven to be “family friendly” over the 
		years. The first published correspondence win by a female ICFR member 
		was in 1980, as Terry Le Foy ( wife of Rotarian Robert Le Foy, 
		Cleveland, Tennessee, USA) triumphed in 9 moves over Dr. Michael Veglin 
		( Skokie, Illinois, USA). Likewise, 3 members of the Higgo family of 
		Cape Town, South Africa ( Rotarian Graham, wife Sonia, and daughter 
		Lisa) were all listed as members in 1983!<br><br>To promote fellowship 
		and interesting play, the ICFR organized several correspondence 
		tournaments over the years. In 1991, a tournament was organized to test 
		ICFR member Maurice Alberny’s self-styled “Rotary Variation” of the Ruy 
		Lopez ( or Spanish Game). Beginning with a required 1. e4, e5; 2. Nf3, 
		Nc6; 3.Bb5, b6 moves, each participant was free to move as he wished fro 
		the remainder of the games. Each of the 56 participants played several 
		games as white and black against fellow ICFR-member tournament partners. 
		In 1994 Gerard Lepine-Fontes (Perpignan, France) organized a 4 team 
		international correspondence tournament: 4 Canadian players versus 4 USA 
		players and 4 European players versus a second team of 4 USA players. In 
		1999 Andre Hariman ( New South Wales, Australia) organized an 
		international correspondence chess tournament consisting of 14 USA 
		players versus 14 international players, will play beginning in January, 
		2000. This newest tournament, the “ Rosamond Cup” is intended to be a 
		permanently repeating tournament, with the winning team being awarded a 
		travelling trophy. (The tournament is named for founder Paul Rosamond in 
		honor of his significant contributions to the ICFR. In addition to his 
		vital role of organizing and financing the ICFR in its first decade. 
		Rosamond also served as a readily available correspondence partner. 
		During the two dozen years of ICFR involvement, Rosamond had partnered 
		with over different active or prospective ICFR members).<br><br>After 
		serving 12 years as ICFR Chairman, Paul Rosamond stepped down in 1989, 
		turning the leadership of the solidly established organization to Vice 
		Chairman Dustin Peters ( Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, USA). In 1991, the 
		ICFR began decentralizing the leadership of the organization with the 
		goal of sharing responsibility more broadly and respond quickly around 
		the world.<br><br>With an eye toward technology, the ICFR has moved to 
		use the Internet to foster even closer communications among ICFR members 
		worldwide. Recognizing the interest of a number of Internet-capable 
		ICFRR members in the speed and cost effectiveness of e-mail, new ICFR 
		Vice Chairman Carl Ross personally undertook the creation of an ICFR 
		e-mail correspondence group immediately following the 1998 RI convention 
		in Indianapolis, USA. Ross established an e-mail directory, a basic set 
		of correspondence rules, and initial pairings. The new e-mail group 
		quickly grew to several dozen active players. With the elimination of 
		in-transit time, games could now be started and finished in months ( or 
		weeks) instead of the more typical 2-3 years with postal play. Likewise, 
		international play became more feasible with both the increased speed 
		and reliability, and reduced cost. Furthermore, the creation of an ICFR 
		e-mail directory made the communications between fellow members both 
		feasible and cost effective.<br><br>An additional step forward in 
		technology occurred with the establishment and design of the initial 
		ICFR website by Brian Clark (Ontario, Canada). Located at 
		http://www.alchemy.on.ca/icfr , (there is now a new website listed 
		below) the website lists current and past officers, registrations and 
		game requests, and a list of Internet accessible members. Longer-term 
		plans include the creation of additional pages to document ICFR By-Laws, 
		history, membership, games, and articles, and establish links to other 
		Rotary or chess related sites of interest to fellow ICFR members and 
		prospective members.<br><br>Addendum below ( by Edgar Calvelo, Napa, 
		California, USA, currently ICFR co-editor)<br><br>The new ICFR website:

		At the present time there are no membership dues. The ICFR editors try 
		to publish The Chessarian monthly and sent by email. Previously it is 
		published 2 times a year in May and November and distributed by regular 
		mail. Because of the cost of printing and mailing the newsletter is sent 
		only by email and published in the ICFR website.<br><br>One goal of the 
		editors is to get the email addresses of the other past members who only 
		had regular postal addresses in the past.<br><br>Rosamond Cup ( 2001) 
		results: Team USA- 8 points and Rest of the World Team- 11 points.<br>
		Greg Farrell organized a tournament during the RI convention 2001 in San 
		Antonio, Texas, USA which consisted of seven players: Greg Farrell 
		(Indiana, USA), David Smith (London, England), Dan Crow (San Antonio, 
		Texas, USA), Bill Van Bergeyk (British Columbia, Canada), Sebastian 
		Castellano (Florida, USA), Nigel Mustapha (New York, USA), and Chp May ( 
		Arlington, Texas, USA). Greg Farrel won the tournament with 4 points and 
		David Smith took second place with 3.5 points.<br><br>In 2002, Maurice 
		Alberny ( France) organized an ICFR team, Rotary Gambit, consisting of 
		Maurice Alberny, Board 1 ( France,) Frank Goedert, Board 2( Luxembourg), 
		Edgar Calvelo, Board 3 ( USA), and Brian Clark, Board 4 ( Canada), 
		participated in the League of Champions section tournament in the 
		International Chess Correspondence Federation ( ICCF). There were eleven 
		teams in the tournament. Our team, Rotary Gambit scored a total of 15.5 
		points and placed 8th place. The Chessfriends, one of the 2 teams from 
		Germany, scored 31 points and won first place. The other teams were from 
		Peru, Spain, Italy, Norway, Poland, Great Britain, Germany, other 
		mixture of players from Ireland, Turkey, Lithuania and USA.<br><br>
		Currently ICFR QUAD matches by group of 4 or more are being organized by 
		Brian Clark. Through the effort of Brian Clark ICFR members also had 
		chess matches with members of the Medical Chess Club of America (MCCA). 
		All games by email correspondence. Ed Waldes suggested to play ICFR 
		games through a website: www.itsyourturn.com and Brian Clark arranged a 
		tournament consisting of six ICFR players: Brian Clark, Edgar Calvelo, 
		Ed Waldes, Ray Garrett, Mayowa Adeyemi and P.R. Venkatesh.<br><br>
