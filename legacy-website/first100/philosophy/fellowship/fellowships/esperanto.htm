		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">In 1928, according to Rotary 
		International, Esperanto became the first Rotary Fellowship. Today, more 
		than 90 fellowships offer Rotarians with similar vocational or 
		recreational interests the chance to enjoy Rotary together.<br><br>By 1928, 
		Rotary was becoming a truly international movement and problems of 
		language were evident. At the time, much of the development of Rotary 
		outside Europe, involved ex-pats, British or American, combining with 
		local businessmen most of whom would have at least a smattering of 
		English.<br><br>However, there was thought by many people to be a need 
		for some auxiliary world language. It was even said that if, as a 
		practical piece of service under the Sixth Object, Rotary Clubs had set 
		to work to agitate for the teaching of a common language in all schools, 
		then the world would have had a grown up generation with a common 
		speech. The recommendation was for the universal language to be 
		Esperanto, devised in 1887 by Dr.Ludwig Zamenhof.<br><br>Several 
		individual Rotarians combined together to form a Rotary Esperanto 
		Fellowship, the first Rotary Fellowship, in 1928. When it was founded, 
		the 'Rotary Wheel' magazine not only carried articles about it, but in 
		succeeding issues actually carried articles in Esperanto, albeit, with 
		English translations. This did not last long, but the Fellowship remains 
		today.<br><br>Forwarded by RGHF Senior Historian Basil Lewis, UK, 15 May 
		2007<br><br>Esperanto Fellowship of Rotarians<br>R.A.D.E. (Rotaria 
		Amikaro De Esperanto)<br>A short History of R.A.D.E.<br><br>The first 
		Fellowship of Rotary International (1928)<br><br>The Global Networking 
		Group R.A.D.E., consisting of Rotarians who use the international 
		neutral language Esperanto, aims to realize Rotary International's 
		objectives of promoting mutual Understanding, Goodwill, Friendship and 
		Peace among nations; fostering high ethical standards, facilitating 
		personal contacts among Rotarians with different linguistic backgrounds 
		and promoting the humanitarian international services of R.I.<br><br>But 
		what is Esperanto? It is a proposed second easy-to-learn language to be 
		used by people, beside the mother tongue, all over the world without any 
		distinction.<br><br>It has no exceptions to the rules as do the national 
		languages, because it would not be able to fulfill its role as a second 
		language if it were difficult to learn. As Esperanto belongs to no one 
		people but to all, consequently it is free from nationalistic concerns.<br>
		<br>However, why Rotarians began to use Esperanto in their international 
		contacts? It happened in the twenties, when the Rotarians in France and 
		those in Britain wanted to work together for &quot;PEACE AND UNDERSTANDING&quot;, 
		but some wanted all to speak English and some wanted all to speak 
		French, and neither group wanted to cede its cultural identity to the 
		other.<br><br>The result was the decision to create in 1928 the RADE 
		Fellowship to promote the use of Esperanto among Rotarians with 
		different linguistic backgrounds.<br><br>They had the vision that in the 
		future of Rotary, the educational and humanitarian partnerships, Group 
		Study Exchanges, volunteer programs, seminars, institutes and 
		conventions would eliminate their communication problems by the use of 
		Esperanto!<br><br>What does that indicate? It shows that our Four-Way 
		Test does not permit us to give advantages only to one nation. Rather we 
		have to be &quot;just and fair to everyone, to provide solutions of goodwill 
		and better friendship.&quot; Therefore, RI uses officially twelve languages, 
		and the tendency is not to lessen the number of languages but to 
		increase it. That means increase of extremely high translation costs.<br>
		<br>In the second Century of Rotary, our Fellowship encourages the 
		advancement of a desirable globalization, using a neutral second 
		language, and so protecting the richness of cultural and linguistic 
		diversity, trying to avoid a worldwide low-level mediocrity.<br><br>THE 
		HISTORY OF R.A.D.E.<br><br>1928 - After three years of preliminary 
		preparation by Esperanto speaking Rotarians in Britain and France, on 
		the 21st of March &quot;Rotaria Esperanto-Amikaro,&quot; the first Fellowship to 
		be registered in R.I., was founded in London. The President was Rotarian 
		J.J.Boutwood of Hastings, and the Secretary-Treasurer was Douglas 
		Boatman of Southend-on-Sea.<br><br>In August, a preparatory meeting of 
		the Fellowship was held in Antwerp, Belgium. On December 15, the first 
		issue of “Mondamikeco&quot; (&quot;World Friendship&quot;), the duplicated bulletin of 
		the Fellowship of Rotarians, was published. In the December issue of 
		&quot;The Rotary Wheel&quot;, then the official organ of R.I.B.I., an article &quot;A 
		tongue for humanity&quot; supportive of Esperanto appeared.<br><br>1929 - The 
		first annual meeting of the Fellowship was held in Paris. Twenty-six 
		members from five countries (Britain, France, Germany, Spain, and the 
		U.S.A.) participated. During the annual meeting of R.I.B.I. a resolution 
		in support of Esperanto was approved.<br><br>1930 - In the official 
		organ &quot;The Rotarian&quot; appeared an article by Karl von Frenckell favorable 
		to Esperanto.<br><br>The annual meeting of the Fellowship occurred in 
		Oxford because of a requirement that offices had to be moved to a new 
		country every other year. Georgies Warnier (Paris) was elected President 
		and Gabriel Havet (Lille) was elected to be Secretary.<br><br>After a 
		favorable report by Charles Mander, it was proposed in The Hague, 
		Netherlands, that next year's congress in Vienna consider the 
		possibility of encouraging the use of Esperanto in the framework of the 
		general work-plan of Rotary. <br><br>1931 - In the 7th number of 
		“Mondamikeco&quot; (&quot;World Friendship&quot;), published in printed form in Paris, 
		there appeared a list of 35 members from 9 countries, including Maurice 
		Duperrey, in Paris, and subsequently President of R.I. in 1937-38. In 
		that same period the British Rotarian Sydney W. Pascall, President of 
		R.I. 1931-32, also became a member of the Esperanto Fellowship.<br><br>
		The Rotary Commission of the World Congress in Vienna, Austria, in 
		accord with a proposal by Sir Charles Mander, accepted a resolution 
		supportive of Esperanto, according to which the Central Committee of 
		Rotary would examine the language problem and its solution using 
		Esperanto.<br><br>The Central Committee of Rotary, having convened in 
		Zurich on the 16th and 17th of September 1931, accepted a motion 
		recognizing that &quot;The International Language is an essential factor for 
		mutual understanding and global friendship. Among the existing auxiliary 
		languages, Esperanto is the most practical because of its simplicity, 
		the ease of learning it, its relatively abundant literature, and its 
		widespread use by its supporters throughout the whole world.&quot;<br><br>
		1932 - The representatives of 2,021 Clubs from 57 countries met during 
		the Rotary World Congress in Boston and accepted a resolution requesting 
		a definite decision, whether Esperanto or another language will be used 
		in order to facilitate relations among Rotarians, and establishing a 
		plan for the teaching of the elected language.<br><br>The Rotary Club of 
		Paris, working cooperatively with other clubs, established in 
		Switzerland a camp for young people in which Esperanto was used as a 
		means of communication.<br><br>The membership of the Esperanto 
		Fellowship grew to 46 members during the annual meeting, which was held 
		in Cologne, Germany.<br><br>Because of the attitude of the new Hitlerian 
		regime, the offices have been moved to the Netherlands. Dr. Meilhuisen 
		of Arnhem became President.<br><br>1935 - A meeting of Rotarian 
		Esperantists occurred during the 26th British Congress of Esperanto in 
		Southend-on-Sea.<br><br>1935 - 1944 - Rotary and Esperanto were 
		prohibited or severely opposed in many European countries. During World 
		War II, contacts between one country and another became almost 
		impossible. The Rotarian Esperanto Fellowship disappeared, but some 
		members preserved the ideal.<br><br>1945 - The Rotary Club of Guararapes 
		(Brazil) included in its work-plan the spreading of Esperanto.<br><br>
		1949 - The Rotary Club of Te Awamutu in New-Zealand at the initiative of 
		local industrialist A.J. Sinclair published a booklet in Esperanto 
		concerning the aims of Rotary as well as two booklets in English about 
		the promoting of Esperanto.<br><br>In the introduction of those 
		booklets, the President of that Club, Philip Quick, wrote: &quot;The 
		Commission for external relations of our Club established friendly 
		relations overseas with hundreds of persons who do not know the English 
		language. That required the use of Esperanto. During 1949, more than 
		1000 letters arrived from 48 countries. <br><br>1955 - On the occasion 
		of the 50th anniversary of Rotary, Dr. H.B. Tiner, President of 
		Pepperdine College and ex-Governor of his District, wrote:<br><br>A main 
		aim of Rotary during the coming 50 years will be the expansion of good 
		relations among the people of the whole world, principally by means of 
		the exchange of ideas, of cultural values, and the drive to abolish 
		illiteracy. No other association is more international than Rotary, and 
		we are capable of overcoming religious, cultural, and economic barriers 
		as we strive to advance international good-will, understanding, and 
		Peace. Because Rotary has such aims, it fully deserves success: but who 
		does not see that Esperanto is the ideal means for realizing them!<br>
		<br>1959 - The Esperantist Rotarian Norman Williams reestablished the 
		association and gave it the new name &quot;Rotaria Amikaro De Esperanto&quot; or 
		&quot;RADE.&quot; (In Esperanto, the term &quot;rade&quot; has the very appropriate meaning 
		&quot;by means of the wheel.&quot;) Following him as President was Graham 
		Leon-Smith, a university professor from Egham (Britain).<br><br>1963 - 
		The French architect Marcel Génermont, Past President of the Rotary Club 
		in Moulins sur-Allier, launched a campaign for the teaching of Esperanto 
		and invited the other French clubs to sign a supportive petition 
		addressed to the school authorities.<br><br>1979 - At the invitation of 
		President Graham Leon-Smith, Marc Levin, chief editor of the French 
		Rotarian magazine “Le Rotarien&quot; and official representative of R.I. to 
		UNESCO in Paris, became Secretary of RADE.<br><br>The magazine “Le 
		Rotarien” published a large service in 20 pages about the advantages in 
		international communication when using Esperanto worldwide as a second 
		language.<br><br>1994 - The first issue of the RADE newsletter was 
		published and distributed to fifty Esperantists in 16 countries. It 
		contained an invitation to nominate candidates for the election of a new 
		board of directors.<br><br>1996 - On the 12th of December there occurred 
		in Nagasaki, Japan, &quot;A Meeting for the Coming Generations,&quot; organized by 
		R.I. and the Governor of District 2740, a member of RADE, Isamu Ito 
		intervened in the debate concerning &quot;International Mutual Understanding 
		and Exchange&quot; to call attention to Esperanto and the activity of RADE.<br>
		<br>1997 - In number four of the RADE newsletter appeared the greeting 
		of the newly elected President Eskil Svane, a Danish diplomat and a 
		member of the Rotary Club in Pezenas (France). Secretary Marc Levin 
		continued in that position. The membership of RADE totaled 63 from 18 
		different countries.<br><br>1998 - Rotarians from five countries 
		attended the annual meeting of RADE, convened within the framework of 
		the 83rd &quot;Universala Kongreso de Esperanto&quot; in Montpellier (France).<br>
		<br>1999 - RADE newsletter number 6 reported about the activity of our 
		members in Italy, Lithuania, and Egypt.<br><br>President Eskil Svane 
		visited the Rotary Club Alto Paraíso, district 4530, (Brazil) and 
		lectured in Esperanto.<br><br>The annual meeting of RADE was held in the 
		framework of the 84th &quot;Universala Kongreso de Esperanto&quot; in Berlin. Some 
		of our members visited two Rotary Clubs in that city, informing them 
		about the Congress of Esperanto.<br><br>2000 - RADE newsletter number 7 
		reported about our annual meeting in the framework of the 85th 
		&quot;Universala Kongreso de Esperanto&quot; in Tel Aviv (Israel), where some of 
		our members visited the Rotary Club of Tel Aviv/Jeff and discussed 
		Esperanto and the Congress.<br><br>In the same newsletter reports from 
		our members in Italy, Samoa, and Brazil appeared. In October, our 
		President Eskil Svane visited new Rotary Clubs in Slovakia, in the two 
		cities of Zilina and Banskà-Bystrica.<br><br>2001 - In the January 
		number of the magazine &quot;Brasil Rotário&quot; appeared a three-page 
		illustrated article &quot;Esperanto, a language without national boundaries&quot; 
		by our President Eskil Svane. It was translated from an article with the 
		same title in the French “Le Rotarien&quot;. In the April issue of “Brasil 
		Rotário&quot; appeared a full-page article by Ursula Grattapaglia, who wrote 
		among other things “Esperanto is the one and only language for 
		international communication which conforms to Rotary's Criteria of the 
		Four Way Test.&quot;<br><br>In November, &quot;Rotary World&quot; published a letter 
		from Eskil Svane, which emphasized that RADE, established in 1928, was 
		the oldest of all Rotary Fellowships.<br><br>In March, during the 
		Latin-American Conference on Population and Evolution, organized in 
		Brasilia under the auspices of R.I. and the United Nations, our member 
		Ursula Grattapaglia, district 4530, was invited to lecture about a 
		successful project in Brazil in the framework of &quot;Education for 
		Self-Sufficiency in Rural Community.&quot; It provided a favorable 
		opportunity to mention the role of Esperanto in social actions.<br><br>
		During the 92nd Rotary World Convention in San Antonio (Texas) RADE 
		presented informations in the General Booth for Fellowships, thus 
		establishing many contacts with Rotarians, mainly from 
		non-English-speaking countries.<br><br>In RADE newsletter number eight 
		appeared reports from our members Paul Desailly (Australia) and Giuseppe 
		and Ursula Grattapaglia (Brazil) concerning their visits to China and 
		Italy.<br><br>2002 - RADE staffed a Fellowship Booth during the 93rd 
		Rotary Convention in Barcelona, Spain.<br><br>In addition to that, RADE 
		members were accepted at the UNESCO Club of Barcelona during a friendly 
		meeting with local Esperantists. In Barcelona, the annual meeting of 
		RADE was convened with members attending from many different countries.<br>
		<br>In the framework of the 87th Universala Kongreso de Esperanto in 
		Fortaleza (Brazil), eight members of RADE and the President of Rotaract 
		from Guarapari (D. 4410) visited Rotary Clubs from the host city to 
		present information about Esperanto and the congress.<br><br>Number 10 
		of the RADE newsletter mentioned the decision of our Fellowship to 
		invite some Districts to present a Resolution Proposal concerning 
		Esperanto during the Council on Legislation in 2004.<br><br>The same 
		newsletter published a call from our member Marco Kappenberg, Isle of 
		Samoa, President of the new Rotarian Environment Fellowship, to join 
		with that group. Esperanto can be considered as an “Ecological language” 
		as it protects the national cultures from an erroneous globalization.<br>
		<br>2003 - RADE set up an information booth during the 94th World 
		Convention of Rotary in Brisbane (Australia). The booth has been staffed 
		by RADE members from Australia, Brazil, Britain and Samoa, demonstrating 
		an example of the full mutual understanding among Rotarians of different 
		language backgrounds.<br><br>The periodical &quot;Rotary World&quot; in its May 
		issue celebrated the 75th anniversary of the founding of RADE, the first 
		Rotarian Fellowship, clearly manifesting the advantages of Esperanto as 
		a fair, neutral, and easily learned instrument of communication.<br><br>
		President Eskil Svane published an article about the collaboration of 
		Esperanto organizations with service clubs such as Rotary, which was 
		published in the French magazine &quot;Le Monde de l´Esperanto&quot; and in 
		Esperanto in the monthly magazine of UEA (Universala Esperanto Asocio) 
		in the Netherlands.<br><br>Among the international visits and contacts 
		by our members, of particular note was the trip by President Eskil Svane 
		(visits to the Mid-Isle Rotary Club on the Caribbean Island of St. 
		Martin and to the Rotary Club of El-Jadida, Morocco) and the visit by 
		Giuseppe and Ursula Grattapaglia to the Clubs of Krakow (Poland), of 
		Warstein-Meschede (Germany), and of Ancona (Italy).<br><br>Issue 11 of 
		the RADE newsletter published the official text of the Resolution 
		Proposal about Esperanto presented by Brazilian Districts 4410 and 4530 
		for discussion at the Council on Legislation of R.I. in 2004.<br><br>

		04-265 requesting that the Rotary Board of Directors consider the 
		gradual introduction of Esperanto in Rotary Clubs throughout the world, 
		which was presented by the Rotary Clubs of Alto Paraíso (Brazil) and 
		Vitória Praia de Camburí (Brazil), was not accepted by the Council on 
		Legislation of R.I., as only 61 districts voted favorably.<br><br>Again 
		RADE set up an information booth during the 95th World Convention of 
		Rotary in Osaka (Japan), awakening a noteworthy interest on the part of 
		Japanese Rotarians.<br><br>Ursula Grattapaglia lectured in Esperanto at 
		the Toyonaka Rotary Club, with a translation into Japanese by RADE 
		member Eizo Otsuka.<br><br>In April District 1780 (the eastern part of 
		France) invited representatives of the Rotary Fellowships to have 
		information booths at its annual conference. Our Secretary Marc Levin 
		represented RADE.<br><br>At the end of July, a group of seven members of 
		RADE participated in the 89th &quot;Universala Kongreso de Esperanto&quot; in 
		Beijing, China. On that occasion, they visited the provisional Rotary 
		Club of Beijing where Ursula Grattapaglia lectured about Esperanto and 
		the Congress. On the way to Beijing, our members were guests of the 
		Rotary Club in Hong Kong.<br><br>2005 – Just becoming a tradition, RADE 
		set up an information booth during the Convention of Rotary 
		International in Chicago. Esperanto speaking Rotarians rotated in 
		staffing the booth, and informed thousands of convention goers about the 
		idea of a better communication by a neutral language. Because of that, 
		new Rotarians joined our Fellowship, so that now our total membership 
		exceeds 100 from 31 different countries.<br><br>In the so-called &quot;Time 
		Capsule&quot; of the Chicago Convention, the President of the Rotary Club of 
		Alto Paraíso (Brazil) deposited a message in Esperanto, which will be 
		read--one hundred years from now!<br><br>An important event of 
		RADE-members occurred in Lithuania, Vilnius, on occasion of the 
		Esperanto World Congress in that country in august 2005.<br><br>Number 
		15 of the RADE newsletter published a ballot for the election of a new 
		RADE board.<br><br>2006 - Number 16 of the RADE newsletter made public 
		the results of the balloting for the new leadership:<br><br>Honorary 
		Chairman: Eskil Svane – RC Locarno, (D1980) Switzerland;<br><br>
		Chairman: Marc Levin - RC Lyon (D.1710) France;<br><br>Secretary 
		-Giuseppe Grattapaglia - RC Alto Paraíso (D.4530) Brazil;<br><br>Board 
		members: Steve Pitney - RC Richmond (D.9800) Australia;<br><br>Eizo 
		Otsuka - RC Toyonaka (D.2660) Japan; <br><br>Antanas Gvildys- R Jubarkas 
		(D.1460) Lithuania.<br><br>The same issue of the newsletter published 
		the Proposal of a new Resolution about Esperanto presented by the Rotary 
		Club Alto Paraíso (D.4530), which was approved by the District 
		Conference and forwarded to R.I. for discussion during the next Council 
		on Legislation.<br><br>A Matching Grant for Brazilian disabled teenagers 
		was concluded with the collaboration of RADE members from Australia, 
		Brazil and The Rotary Foundation.<br><br>2007 Two more newsletters (17 
		and 18) have been distributed by e-mail to our members. During the Salt 
		Lake City Convention of Rotary International, the RADE members staffed 
		again the Fellowship booth. During this Convention, RADE members decided 
		to cooperate for a Matching Grant in Brazil in partnership with members 
		in Belgium, France and England and TRF. The correspondence between the 
		districts occurred in Esperanto in both Humanitarian Projects. 
		Friendship visits between clubs have been organized in Belgium and in 
		Brazil.<br><br>In April 2007, the Council on Legislation refused once 
		more the recommendation to introduce gradually the use of a neutral 
		language in our 33.000 clubs with hundred different languages, but did 
		not hesitate to add Russian and Hindi to the number of official 
		languages in R.I.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>Our Fellowship is aware, that 
		the vision of RI for worldwide Understanding and Peace is still an 
		Utopia.<br><br>We still do not have one common language, (but twelve) in 
		which we could communicate with our fellow Rotarians who speak Russian 
		or Arabic, Chinese or Hungarian, Finnish or Korean, French or Polish.<br>
		<br>However, the tremendous technological progress in communication and 
		transportation calls for a solution with the greatest urgency!<br><br>
		Our great PPRI PAULO VIRIATO, before leaving us, wrote in the BRASIL 
		ROTÁRIO magazine: &quot;We Rotarians need a common language, a type of 
		Rotarenglish.&quot;<br><br>No longer is it an acceptable solution to use, as 
		we presently do, a NATIONAL language as an INTERNATIONAL one.<br><br>The 
		PPRI Ravizza, during his leadership said: &quot;ROTARY HAS TO BE AHEAD OF THE 
		FACTS AND NOT JUST RUN BEHIND THEM&quot;.<br><br>Given this situation, what 
		is the task of Rotary International in the context of the global 
		language problem?<br><br>We need to take account of how the world has 
		changed. Rotary was born 100 years ago. In what kind of language did the 
		first Rotarians speak with Paul Harris in 1905? Everyone knows that it 
		was the North-American language, one of the 37 official varieties of the 
		English language from England.<br><br>However, today the situation is 
		very different. We have Rotarians in 200 countries with more than 100 
		different languages.<br><br>We Rotarians are preparing the future. The 
		quality of that future depends on what we think, say, and do today!<br>
		<br>Are we, both as an organization and as individuals, going to address 
		the world language problem?<br><br>Our Fellowship RADE tries to do its 
		best in creating awareness and taking action -<br><br>As we have “to 
		lead the way”!<br><br>The Secretary of RADE<br>Giuseppe Grattapaglia<br>
