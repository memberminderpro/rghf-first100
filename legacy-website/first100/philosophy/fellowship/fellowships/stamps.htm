		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">Attracted by the new stamp being 
		issued in 1955 to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Rotary 
		International, Jerry Husak of Lake Forest, Illinois (a non-Rotarian) 
		suggested to the American Topical Association that they have a &quot;Study 
		Unit&quot; devoted to these commemoratives. Ed Flatch, A T A Director of 
		Units, assented and named Jerry as Secretary, and he in turn named Ed as 
		President. John Tapley of Kenosha, Wisconsin, became Vice-President. 
		Before the year was over, Ed sold his collection and resigned. Jerry 
		became President and named Dan Lincoln of Jamestown, New York, as 
		Secretary-Treasurer and Bulletin Editor. Dan was a Past District 
		Governor (PDG) of Rotary and the first Rotarian member of the Unit. 
		Twenty-three Charter Members signed up and paid $1.00 annual dues.<br>
		<br>The first thing we did was get in trouble with the United States 
		Secret Service. We had pasted up bits of half a dozen Rotary stamps 
		using several languages and designs and no denomination or country as an 
		attractive part of the masthead for our Bulletin and stationery. We were 
		promptly notified by the Secret Service (and I don't know how they found 
		out) that we were violating the Federal counterfeiting law and were told 
		to &quot;cease and desist.&quot; They admitted that it was not really a stamp, but 
		&quot;it looked like one.&quot; We were scared. So we quickly burned all the 
		paper, apologized all over the place and &quot;ceased and desisted,&quot; trying 
		to keep out of jail. We thought it was an attractive design, and now we 
		can show it. The law has been changed.<br><br>In that year, thirty-one 
		more members were added. Six Bulletins were issued. Emerson Gause of the 
		R.I. Secretariat, the liaison man working on the stamps, and Karl 
		Krueger, Editor of The Rotarian magazine, were named as Honorary 
		Members. RoS received wide-spread publicity in the philatelic press.<br>
		<br>Rotary International on Stamps, A T A's Handbook No. 17, was 
		published in 1957. It was the most elaborate they had issued and the 
		most profusely illustrated. Reviewers gave it &quot;raves,&quot; and it became the 
		&quot;bible&quot; of Rotary collectors. Lauren Januz resigned and Dan Lincoln was 
		asked to take over as RoS President. Budd Simon of Pleasantville, New 
		York, became Vice-President and M.G. Ringenberg of Bel Air, Maryland, 
		Secretary. The checklist reached 41 pages and completed the detailed 
		coverage of all the issues. The Bulletin had increased to 10 pages and 
		the 100th member joined. A new slogan was adopted -&quot;In Philatelia Nearly 
		Everybody Reads the Bulletin.&quot; The first U.S. Postal Cancellation for a 
		Rotary District conference was authorized for use at Buffalo, New York 
		(District 709), and following that example the first R.I. Convention 
		postal cancellation followed it in June at Dallas, Texas.<br><br>Dr. 
		Benjamin Steinberg of Hancock, New York, was elected President at the 
		RoS Annual Meeting held at TOPEX '59 in New York City. Dr. J. Kler of 
		New Brunswick, New Jersey, became Vice-President, and Ringenberg and 
		Lincoln were re-elected. The first Unit cacheted covers were issued, and 
		a Sales Circuit plan was put into operation. The Bulletin continued to 
		be a big help with news about newly discovered cancellations, cachets, 
		seals and other related material from around the world. Exhibits of 
		Rotary stamps which won awards were noted and the columns were opened 
		for free buy and sell advertisements.<br><br>The 1961 Bulletin was 
		reduced to six pages and six issues per year. Vol. VII, No.6 numbered 
		its last page as &quot;#340&quot; and thus adopted a new page-numbering system. By 
		June, 1962, the membership stood at 200 and the treasury at $700. For 
		some inexplicable reasons, Rotary on Stamps went into a state of limbo 
		for the next 6 years. Nobody died; nobody ran off with the money. There 
		was just complete apathy and there was nothing much happening in the 
		Rotary stamp world.<br><br>In December, 1968, Gene Atkinson sent out a 
		six-page &quot;inquiry&quot; Bulletin to a dozen former members. Rejuvenation had 
		begun! Vol. VIII under his tender, loving care, and an increasing number 
		of members under President Frank Brasch of Oakland, California, sprang 
		into service. Anton Dekom (a non-Rotarian) helped the Sales Department 
		and Gene became Secretary-Treasurer and Bulletin Editor. Membership grew 
		and the Bulletin expanded to eigQt pages. An excellent Slide Film 
		Program was made available to Rotary and stamp clubs through RoS and AT 
		A. It told a GREAT story. Gene wrote the script.<br><br>Along here 
		somewhere, Rotary International thought the idea of our &quot;interest-group&quot; 
		was a good one and proceeded to create their &quot;World Fellowship 
		Activities to encompass a broader contact with Rotarian hobbyists. R.I. 
		Pamphlet #729 established the criteria for participation and RoS humbly 
		(and proudly) took some of the credit for the idea. As a Convention 
		Service, RoS arranges annually for a &quot;Mixture Pickin' Table&quot; where 
		hundreds of thousands of stamps supplied by RoS members, clubs and the 
		Secretariat offices are made available to conventioneers (young and old) 
		to &quot;help themselves. “ RoS members are assigned to the area to talk 
		stamps with all interested collectors.<br><br>PDG Robert Horion of 
		Antwerp, Belgium, was named Vice-President in 1977. The Bulletin was 
		improved with better illustrations and more pages, and with a continuous 
		stream of newly discovered cancellations, cachets and several new 
		stamps. New interest was created for all readers. Membership from all 
		over the world sprang to new highs. Dr. Dave Huang of Thousand Oaks, 
		California, was named as Sales Circuit Manager, another RoS service to 
		collectors.<br><br>In anticipation of increased interest due to the 75th 
		Anniversary observance, the Handbook Rotary International on Stamps was 
		reprinted in 1980 and designated as &quot;Vol. I 1929-1956.&quot; Dan Lincoln was 
		named Editor-in-Chief of a Vol. II, 1956-1979, which would include an 
		extensive Addenda to Vol. I. Vol. III, 1980-1984, was also planned for 
		early publication and Dr. David Huang was named as Editor-in Chief of 
		that new volume. Each new volume followed the same format as Vol. I and 
		was profusely illustrated and documented to give Rotary collectors a 
		complete reference source.<br><br>In 1980 came the deluge of worldwide 
		issues observing Rotary's 75th Anniversary. With it came PDG James 
		Martin of Old Town, Maine, as President. Membership shot up to near 400 
		and the annual dues to $5. The Bulletin increased to twelve pages, 
		improved its illustrations and was issued five times a year. The 
		Handbook's second printing was sold out in 1981. An attractive set of 
		cacheted covers was designed by George Mann for the Dallas International 
		Convention. A third printing of the Handbook was ordered. A Library of 
		Congress Card Catalog Number was assigned to the Handbook and the new 
		volumes copyrighted.<br><br>J. Paul Van Nest of Kingston, Ontario, 
		Canada, was named Coordinator of Affairs for the Toronto Convention. 
		Peter Offer of Coventry , England, was named First Vice-President, and 
		PDG Bryce Kendall of Salem, Ohio, as Second Vice-President. Dan Lincoln 
		was elected Treasurer and Huang and Atkinson were re-elected Sales 
		Manager and Secretary. New Directors all from outside the U.S. were 
		H.J.C. Van Beek (Netherlands), Moti J. Pariyani (India), Andres J. Abad 
		(Argentina), Amu J. Shah (Tanzania), and E.H. van Broeknuzen 
		(Netherlands). A new Slide film Program was prepared with copies on loan 
		from RoS, R.I., ATA, and A.P.S. without cost. Vice-President Offer was 
		named to serve as Coordinator for RoS Affairs and the 1984 Birmingham 
		Rotary International Convention. New promotional pieces and Membership 
		Applications (in several languages) were prepared.<br><br>In the summer 
		of 1983 RoS issued its &quot;Century Edition&quot; Bulletin. The course to #100 
		was fitful but fun.<br></td>

	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">As the Rotary world began to 
		issue more and more stamps to honor the International organization, an 
		&quot;Addenda to the Addenda&quot; was added to the Bulletin to help keep members 
		up-to-date with new issue information. Rotary on Stamps national groups 
		sprang up in Argentina, Netherlands, Israel and France in the early 
		1980's. Jerry Seufert of Long Island, New York, represented RoS at the 
		1985 ASDA show in Madison Square Garden in New York City. Visitors were 
		able to view an exhibit, purchase Handbooks and attend lectures on 
		Rotary and stamps. George Mann continued to design cachets for the 
		International Conventions in Kansas City (1985), Las Vegas (1986), 
		Munich, Germany (1987), Philadelphia (1989) Seoul, Korea (1988), and 
		more.<br><br>Bryce Kendall of Salem, Ohio became the President, with 
		Michael Gosney of Farnborough, England First Vice-President and Ivan 
		Kaldor of Rehovot, Israel Second Vice-President. Atkinson and Lincoln 
		were re-elected as Secretary and Treasurer.<br><br>In 1985, Don Fiery of 
		Hanover, Pennsylvania became the Secretary-Treasurer and also was named 
		Editor of the Bulletin. A period of fiscal growth followed during which 
		several debts were paid off and a profitable sales program inaugurated. 
		The Bulletin celebrated its 30th Anniversary under Don's leadership and 
		membership continued to grow. A detailed checklist was developed and 
		published in the Bulletin - 8 pages of small handwritten information 
		listing all the stamps and their varieties.<br><br>After a year's 
		preparation, Ernst-Theodor Juergens of Augsburg, Germany (a 
		non-Rotarian) published a 240-page ftlll-color catalog of his Rotary 
		collection, the most thorough listing of all Rotary items to date. Dr. 
		Dave Huang prepared Handbook Vol. IV 1985-1991. Another new RoS 
		publication came into being when R. J. Dickson of Weems, Virginia 
		submitted his design for a Rotary album. Quickly adopted by RoS, Dickson 
		made his album available to all collectors and introduced It at the 
		Orlando Convention in 1992. It has since been expanded to over 300 pages 
		and includes illustrations of all the stamps, souvenir sheets, and many 
		of the cinderellas. At the Orlando Convention, Dickson and Huang began 
		discussions of revising the Handbooks, with the possibility of a new 
		combined edition in mind. That new publication evolved into this present 
		RoS Encyclopedia.<br><br>At the 1996 Convention in Calgary, Canada, 
		Edward Robinson of Leeds, England was elected Chairman, R. J. Dickson 
		and Ivan N. Kaldor were re-elected Vice-Chairmen, Don Fiery was 
		re-elected Secretary- Treasurer. The Constitution and By-Laws were 
		amended to reaffirm our historical roots as a Study Unit of the American 
		Topical Association and as a part of the Rotary International 
		Recreational Fellowships program. Also, a new Life Member category was 
		established to strengthen the long-term membership of RoS, the offices 
		of President and Vice-President were redesignated Chairman and 
		Vice-Chairman in keeping with the policy of Rotary International for its 
		Fellowships.<br><br>The mid-1990s saw the loss of several long time and 
		outstanding members in the passing of Tony Dekom, Dan Lincoln, Justin 
		Bachrach, Bryce Kendall, and George Mann. Their many contributions and 
		friendship to many members will be missed.<br><br>1999 saw the 
		introduction of a new special album for imperforate stamps and souvenir 
		sheets, 2001 brought a new book for the Conservation Year overprints, 
		2002 a new album for Specimen overprints.<br><br>In the middle of 2003 
		RoS underwent a major change with the retirement of Donald E. Fiery of 
		Hanover, Pennsylvania as Secretary- Treasurer, a position he held since 
		1985. Past Chairman and current Bulletin Editor and Director of 
		Publications Richard J. Dickson of Virginia, USA agreed to fill the 
		Secretary- Treasurer vacancy, and the offices of RoS were moved from 
		Pennsylvania to Irvington, Virginia. At the Convention in Brisbane, 
		Australia, the first RoS Catalog listing all RoS items, many 
		illustrated, was introduced. Prices are in US dollars and reflect 
		averages of sales and purchases as reported by members.<br><br>In 2003, 
		Rotary on Stamps received a gift from Donald E. Fiery of his complete 
		collection of RoS commemoratives, covers, matchbooks, and other Rotary 
		related material. The new Secretary-Treasurer, Richard J. Dickson, was 
		named by Fiery to serve as the curator of this historic collection. 
		Since RoS is a US designated tax-exempt non-profit organization, U.S. 
		members may now donate their collections to the Fellowship, and either 
		take a charitable contribution tax deduction in that year, or designate 
		it as a charitable gift in their estate plan. RoS will maintain an 
		archival collection of all RoS items donated to the Fellowship, with the 
		provision that we will sell duplicates to help offset our operational 
		expenses.</td>
