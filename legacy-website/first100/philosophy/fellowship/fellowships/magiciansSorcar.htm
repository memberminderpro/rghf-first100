				Sorcar (1913-1971)<br><br>P.C. SORCAR: OUR ROTARY CLUB MEMBER<br><br>
				by Mihir Roy, Past President, South West Calcutta Rotary 
				Club, Calcutta, West BengalIndia India's Ambassador of 
				Magic, Protul Chandra Sorcar, more popularly known as the Great 
				P.C. Sorcar, TW's GM (The World's Greatest Magician) was then 
				a name already well-known to us all, as he was touring 
				throughout the world with his inimitable Magic Show IND-DRA-JAL. 
				He was earning fresh laurels for our Motherland by breaking 
				theatre attendance and box office records throughout the
				world and above all by earning valuable foreign exchange for our 
				country. A man of erudition, amiable nature and pleasing 
				personality he was giving talks in the Rotary Clubs, Lions Clubs 
				and various travel clubs all over the world. <br> <br>I 
				happened to be present during one such talk on 'Magic in Many 
				Lands' in the Rotary Club of Calcutta in the Grand Hotel and 
				once again at the South West Calcutta Rotary Club in 
				Kidderpore and the idea flashed in my mind that he should 
				himself be a Member of our Rotary Club. A man of resource, 
				integrity, having a name well-known everywhere and having his 
				business allover the world specially as a Top man in his 
				Vocation or profession, he should have no difficulty in
				joining any Rotary Club. Within a few months we found him as an 
				Active Member of the South West Calcutta Rotary Club under 
				the Classification &quot;Recreation; Magic ... Entertaining&quot;. His 
				most familiar picture with feathered turban was seen in the 
				Roaster of the club as P. C. Sorcar ... &quot;the World's Greatest 
				Magician&quot;. At that time Rotarian Nitish Chandra Laharry amongst 
				many other veteran Rotarians of Calcutta highly complimented 
				us on having this fabulous SORCAR as a Member of the Rotary, 
				as he will inevitable prove to be an asset of our world-wide 
				organisation. Next, when I was the president of the South 
				West Calcutta Totary Club, we were glad to appoint him as the 
				Chairman of International Contacts Committee, which post he 
				serve most creditably.<br><br>
				<img border="5" height="240" src="images/magicianssorcar13.jpg" style="float: right" width="320">Sorcar took great interest in our 
				organisation. He regularly attended our weekly meetings and 
				tried to keep up his hundred per cent attendance records as 
				far as possible by attending the Rotary Club meetings in the 
				different countries on tour. As we go through our Minute Books 
				we find that he has toured Middle East, East Africa, Europe, 
				America and Japan after he joined Rotary and he has attended 
				Rotary Club meetings in each and every country he has visited. 
				He received Rotary Club banners from all parts of the world 
				and later presented them to his home club in Calcutta by dozens
				to the utter delight and amazement of his fellow members. Our 
				meeting room is now full of the colorful Rotary banners that 
				he has brought from all over the world. He has presented us 
				Rotary Club banners from Chicago, New York, Las Vegas, Paris, 
				London, Hong Kong, Tehran, Nairobi, Mombassa, Kampala Dar-es-Salam 
				etc. and even from the Rotary Club of NEW YORK WORLD's FAIR 
				1964. He has brought Rotary banners from Japan by dozens 
				including the ones from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <br><br>Sorcar became 
				the Guest Speaker in the Rotary Clubs in all the five 
				continents. In India we heard him speaking amongst others in 
				the Rotary Clubs of Calcutta, South West Calcutta, Burdwan, 
				Barrackpore, Budge Budge, Behala, Garden Reach, Amravati, 
				Bombay and many others. Sorcar failed to give talkand bring 
				Rotary Club banners from only one country, through he stayed 
				there for more than one month with his Magic Show, on State 
				invitation in a Cultural Exchange Programme. It was the Soviet
				Union which he visited in November and December 1962. On enquiry 
				the answer he gave was quite simple. There is NO Rotary Club 
				in the Communist countries.<br><br>
				<img border="2" height="240" src="images/magicianssorcar11.jpg" style="float: left" width="320">Sorcar is noted for his 
				persuasive talks and ready wit. In this connection one can 
				easily refer to the incident at the Rotary Club of Chicago. 
				After attending the World Magic Congress session (July 6-9,
				1960) Boston, U.S.A. as the Chief Guest and Judge, Sorcar went 
				to Chicago and attended the Rotary Club of Chicago in the 
				following week. The election fever was already there and the 
				<a href="http://www.1905timeline.org"><strong>Rotary Club of Chicago</strong></a> was playing host to the entire 
				Republican National Committee who assembled at Chicago in
				connection with the choosing of their nominee for the United 
				States Presidency. Mr. Sorcar, himself a Rotarian, was 
				watching the deliberations when the meeting requested him to 
				perform his most favourite trick. the request took Rtn. 
				Sorcar unawares. But then he smiled significantly at the array 
				of Republican party leaders and said that it was hardly an 
				ideal place to play his favourite trick because in the first 
				place he had arrived there fresh from Boston and secondly 
				because his most favourite trick was the 'Vanishing 
				Elephant'. That remark brought the house down. It was greeted 
				with no less a thunderous applause that any of his remarkable 
				feats of magic would fetch. It may be noted that the Elephant 
				in America politics traditionally means the Republican party. 
				And Boston is the home town of Kennedy, the Presidential 
				nominee of the rival Democratic party. The Republicans, of 
				course, enjoyed the joke instead of enjoying the Vanishing 
				Elephant trick. The idea of their being vanished, or even
				vanquished, was hardly enjoyable anyway, specially when 'a guy 
				from Boston' plays the trick. In the past eight years (he 
				became Rotary member on 13th November 1958) Sorcar has served 
				our Rotary Club in various capacities. Last year he was our 
				Director, International Committee, and member, Rotary 
				Foundation Committee, in the current year he is the Chairman, 
				Membership Committee of the Rotary Club of South West 
				Calcutta.<br><br>The Rotarian, magazine of the Rotary 
				International, published from Evanston, USA, in its issue of May
				1963, page 47 published an excellent illustrated article about 
				Rtn. Sorcar under the heading &quot;MAGIC MAKER&quot;. &quot;There are 
				tricks to all trades, but my trade is all tricks&quot;, says Sorcar. 
				Working on the ideathat it is possible to fool all of the 
				people all of the time Sorcar successfully presents his magic 
				all over the world. So trickery must not only be done, but 
				must be seen to be done some times. Sorcar's programme of 
				'Magic' leaves the impression that what seemed illusion might 
				have been fact; that one would like to see it all done again. 
				As a brilliant showman, he knows how to conjure up all the 
				thrilling mystery of the unfathomable East; and as an 
				entertainer, he is making money at it. As a brother Rotarian, 
				we are proud of Padmashri P. C. Sorcar, a most enthusiastic 
				member of our Rotary Club.<br></td>
