				<img class="auto-style26" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/philosophy/harris/1911rational_files/image004.jpg" style="float: left">Philosophy made simple: ad of the Cunard Line, The Rotarian, 
				June 1960<br><br>We know to whom this shout was directed: the 
				Rotarians of Chicago. But one notes with interest the fantasy in 
				which Paul was indulging. He had seldom, if ever, shouted; would 
				certainly never had dreamed of doing so from a platform.<br>
				<br>"It was in pursuit of it that the pilgrim fathers embarked 
				in their frail craft upon the stormy waters. It was from the 
				chrysalis toleration that lustrous winged liberty, awakened by 
				the music of the sweetest toned bell on earth, sprang and 
				floated away that July day in Philadelphia, while the world 
				dreamed and wondered."<br><br>And though Paul Harris was harking 
				back to his beloved, and romanticised, New England boyhood, was 
				he not only too aware that the society established by those 
				Pilgrim Fathers was the most intolerant ever known on the North 
				American continent? But, knowing his Rotary time was short, he 
				had important things to say and nothing more important has ever 
				been said about Rotary.<br><br>So he writes his first article 
				about &quot;Rational Rotarianism&quot; in the first issue of &quot;The National 
				Rotarian&quot;, Volume I, January 1911, No. 1 and asks: &quot;What is the 
				philosophy of Rotary as you understand it?&quot; In his article, a 
				few characters with different viewpoints express their opinion. <br>
				<br>To "Mr. Ethical Standard", this business-getting feature of 
				Rotary looks dangerous. "What will people think of us", he asks.
				<br><br>Let us skip for now the Bunyanesque bits - involving 
				characters like Mr. Cash Discount and Mr. Vigorously Definite - 
				and quote these powerful, prophetic lines, packed as they are 
				with disturbing insight: <br><br>Life in Rotary should consist 
				of a rational mixture of business with civic activities and good 
				fellowship. [...] There should be no occasion for meeting behind 
				closed doors. If Rotarianism cannot stand the test of trial 
				before a jury comprised of the entire American people, then it 
				lacks rationality and should be changed. [...] No doctrine is 
				immune from criticism. It is part of wisdom to profit from 
				rational criticism, not so much because of what other people 
				think of us as because of what they cause us to think of 
				ourselves. [...] Let us be in a position to defend ourselves ... 
				not by stentorian shouting of meaningless words but by logic 
				that convinces. [...] A grave responsibility lies on your 
				shoulders and mine. [...] Rotary is a huge, powerful machine. 
				Unguided, it could crash down the aisles of time a menace to all 
				mankind. Well directed, it will become a humanizing 
				instrumentality of which we need not be ashamed.&nbsp; <br><br>
				Paul Harris was writing more than a New Year’s Day Message for 
				Rotarians of then and now. He was writing on the first day of 
				the modern era, with the Armageddon growing impatient in the 
				wings and Europe full of very real, brutal and three-dimensional 
				&quot;huge, powerful&quot; machines about to thrash unguided &quot;down the 
				aisles of time&quot;, a menace and doom to all mankind and to the 
				societies in which they were born [...].&quot;&nbsp; <br><br>"Mr. Vigorously Definite" says on 
				the subject: "If anyone tells you that it is reprehensible to 
				try to make a dollar or two for the wife and babies from club 
				associates in straight forward business transactions tell that 
				person that some foreign substance has gotten into his 
				carburettor." <br><br>"Mr. Cash Discount "goes one step further. 
				"Business is what I am here for. It is my idea that a club can 
				be either a business club or it can be a society club or 
				something else."<br><br>Finally a man speaks, whose statements 
				occupy the biggest part of the 5000-word-article, and whose 
				ideas are probably Paul Harris’s own. "Mr. Altruistic 
				Equilibrium "finds boastful words: "Is there no place in Rotary 
				for a man who believes that Rotary ought to be something more 
				than a mere business exchange? Is there no place in Rotary for 
				him who recognizes the fact that he, as an American citizen of 
				this day and age, has been the recipient of a vast heritage, the 
				result of efforts of generations who have passed beyond, and who 
				thinks it his duty to do something toward balancing his account 
				by doing something for the public present and for generations 
				that are yet to come." <br><br>&quot;Men work and play, fight and 
				make peace, love and hate, live and die all in persuit of 
				happiness; and how often in ill considered pursuit of happiness. 
				Men barter the joy of years for the mirth of a day. Rotarian 
				philosophers, let us try to view this thing called life as a 
				whole, look it over, up and down, in and out, and then pick it 
				to pieces, dissect it, analyze, synthesize and understand it. <br>
				<br>Paul P. Harris, R.I. President 1910 - 12 <br><br>"Let us not 
				be frightened by the term "the philosophy of Rotary". [...] our 
				philosophy embraces nothing more than the expression of the 
				Golden Rule, that you do unto others as you would that others do 
				unto you."<br><br>Frank L. Mulholland, R.I. President 1914 - 15
				<br><br>"What is meant by philosophy is merely to attempt to get 
				a universal explanation of things; to analyze the universe down 
				to the dust it is made of."<br><br>E. Leslie Pidgeon, R.I. 
				President 1917 - 18 <br><br>The list of these enlightening 
				statements could be continued endlessly. No wonder, that Glenn 
				C. Mead, R.I. President 1912-13 and chairman of the "Committee 
				on Philosophy and Education", which had been already established 
				in 1914 during the Convention in Houston, began his report at 
				the Convention in San Francisco in 1915 with the following 
				remarks: <br><br>"If anybody came to this convention with his 
				spear poised or his gun loaded for philosophers, I do not think 
				he ought to point it at me - I was not on the spot at Houston 
				when the trouble began."<br><br>Summing up, Paul Harris believes 
				that nearly all of the members of every Rotary Club in existence 
				would readily fall into one or another of three classes. <br>
				<br>First. Those who believe with Mr. Ethical Standard that 
				business should have no part in the club life of Rotary. <br>
				<br>Second. Those who believe with Mr. Cash Discount that 
				business should constitute the entire club life of Rotary. <br>
				<br>Third. Those who believe with Mr. Altruistic Equilibrium 
				that life in rotary should consist of a rational mixture of 
				business with civic activities and good fellowship. <br><br>
				Undoubtedly Paul Harris favoured the viewpoint of Mr. Altruistic 
				Equilibrium. He introduces the service idea - so to speak 
				through the backdoor - as an element of equal value in Rotary 
				and makes it part of the Rotarian philosophy. <br><br>Being a 
				good democrat, in closing he asks the following questions: <br>
				<br>"Now, Rotarians of the United States and of Canada, what say 
				you? Which side of the debate would you take and why? We want to 
				hear from you." <br><br>Yours, fraternally and very sincerely,
				<br><br>PAUL P. HARRIS<br>Chicago, January 1, 1911.<br>

				Manifesto is still more relevant than anything written about the 
				Movement since, including much by himself in later years [...]." <br></td>
