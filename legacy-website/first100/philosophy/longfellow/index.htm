        <div align="left">
          <font size="2">Probably one of the best loved American poets the world over is Henry 
          Wadsworth Longfellow. Many of his lines are as familiar to us as 
          rhymes from Mother Goose or the words of nursery songs learned in 
          early childhood. Like these rhymes and melodies, they remain in the 
          memory and accompany us through life.</font><p>
			<font size="2">There are two reasons for the 
          popularity and significance of Longfellow's poetry. First, he had the 
          gift of easy rhyme. He wrote poetry as a bird sings, with natural 
          grace and melody. Read or heard once or twice, his rhyme and meters 
          cling to the mind long after the sense may be forgotten.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2">Second, Longfellow wrote on obvious themes which appeal to all 
          kinds of people. His poems are easily understood; they sing their way 
          into the consciousness of those who read them. Above all, there is a 
          joyousness in them, a spirit of optimism and faith in the goodness of 
          life which evokes immediate response in the emotions of his readers.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2">Americans owe a great debt to Longfellow because he was among the 
          first of American writers to use native themes. He wrote about the 
          American scene and landscape, the American Indian <i>('Song of 
          Hiawatha')</i>, and American history and tradition <i>('The Courtship 
          of Miles Standish', 'Evangeline')</i>. At the beginning of the 19th 
          century, America was a stumbling babe as far as a culture of its own 
          was concerned. The people of America had spent their years and their 
          energies in carving a habitation out of the wilderness and in fighting 
          for independence. Literature, art, and music came mainly from Europe 
          and especially from England. Nothing was considered worthy of 
          attention unless it came from Europe.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2">But &quot;the flowering of New England,&quot; as Van Wyck Brooks terms the 
          period from 1815 to 1865, took place in Longfellow's day, and he made 
          a great contribution to it. He lived when giants walked the New 
          England earth, giants of intellect and feeling who established the New 
          Land as a source of greatness. Nathaniel Hawthorne, <b>
          <a target="_top" href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/philosophy/emerson/index.htm" style="text-decoration: none">
          Ralph Waldo Emerson</a></b>, <b>

          <a href="http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/philosophy/holmes/index.htm" style="text-decoration: none">Oliver 
          Wendell Holmes</a></b>, and William Prescott were a few of the great 
          minds and spirits among whom Longfellow took his place as a singer and 
          as a representative of America.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2">The first Longfellow came to America in 1676 from Yorkshire, 
          England. Among the ancestors of the poet on his mother's side were 
          John and Priscilla Alden, of whom he wrote in <i>'The Courtship of 
          Miles Standish'</i>. His mother's father, Peleg Wadsworth, had been a 
          general in the Revolutionary War. His own father was a lawyer. The 
          Longfellow home represented the graceful living which was beginning to 
          characterize the age.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2">Henry was the son of Stephen Longfellow and Zilpah Wadsworth 
          Longfellow. He was born February 27, 1807, in Portland, Maine. 
          Portland was a seaport, and this gave its citizens a breadth of view 
          lacking in the more insular New England towns. The variety of people 
          and the activity of the harbors stirred the mind of the boy and gave 
          him a curiosity about life beyond his own immediate experience. He was 
          sent to school when he was only three years old. When he was six, the 
          following report of him was received at home: &quot;Master Henry Longfellow 
          is one of the best boys we have in school. He spells and reads very 
          well. He can also add and multiply numbers. His conduct last quarter 
          was very correct and amiable.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font size="2">From the beginning, it was evident that this boy was to be drawn to 
          writing and the sound of words. His mother read aloud to him and his 
          brothers and sisters the high romance of Ossian, the legendary Gaelic 
          hero. Cervantes' <i>'Don Quixote'</i> was a favorite among the books 
          he read. But the book which influenced him most was Washington 
          Irving's <i>'Sketch Book'</i>. Irving was another American author for 
          whom the native legend and landscape were sources of inspiration.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2">&quot;Every reader has his first book,&quot; wrote Longfellow later. &quot;I mean 
          to say, one book among all others which in early youth first 
          fascinates his imagination, and at once excites and satisfies the 
          desires of his mind. To me, the first book was the <i>'Sketch Book'</i> 
          of Washington Irving.&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font size="2">Longfellow's father was eager to have his son become a lawyer. But 
          when Henry was a senior at Bowdoin College at 19, the college 
          established a chair of modern languages. The recent graduate was asked 
          to become the first professor, with the understanding that he should 
          be given a period of time in which to travel and study in Europe.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2">In May of 1826, the fair-haired youth with the azure blue eyes set 
          out for Europe to turn himself into a scholar and a linguist. He had 
          letters of introduction to men of note in England and France, but he 
          had his own idea of how to travel. Between conferences with important 
          people and courses in the universities, Longfellow walked through the 
          countries. He stopped at small inns and cottages, talking to peasants, 
          farmers, traders, his silver flute in his pocket as a passport to 
          friendship. He travelled in Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and 
          England, and returned to America in 1829. At 22, he was launched into 
          his career as a college professor. He had to prepare his own texts, 
          because at that time none were available.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2">Much tribute is due him as a teacher. Just as he served America in 
          making the world conscious of its legend and tradition, so he opened 
          to his students and to the American people the literary heritage of 
          Europe. He created in them the new consciousness of the literature of 
          Spain, France, Italy, and especially writings from the German, Nordic, 
          and Icelandic cultures.</font></div>

		<font size="2">In 1831, he 
        married Mary Storer Potter, whom he had known as a schoolmate. When he 
        saw her at church upon his return to Portland, he was so struck by her 
        beauty that he followed her home without courage enough to speak to her. 
        With his wife, he settled down in a house surrounded by elm trees. He 
        expended his energies on translations from Old World literature and 
        contributed travel sketches to the New England Magazine, in addition to 
        serving as a professor and a librarian at Bowdoin.</font><p>
		<font size="2">In 1834, he was 
        appointed to a professorship at Harvard and once more set out for Europe 
        by way of preparation. This time his young wife accompanied him. The 
        journey ended in tragedy. In Rotterdam, his wife died, and Longfellow 
        came alone to Cambridge and the new professorship. The lonely Longfellow 
        took a room at historic Craigie House, an old house overlooking the 
        Charles River. It was owned by Mrs. Craigie, an eccentric woman who kept 
        much to herself and was somewhat scornful of the young men to whom she 
        let rooms. But she read widely and well, and her library contained 
        complete sets of Voltaire and other French masters. Longfellow entered 
        the beautiful old elm-encircled house as a lodger, not knowing that this 
        was to be his home for the rest of his life. In time, it passed into the 
        possession of Nathan Appleton. Seven years after he came to Cambridge, 
        Longfellow married Frances Appleton, daughter of Nathan Appleton, and 
        Craigie House was given to the Longfellows as a wedding gift.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Meantime, in the seven intervening years, he remained a rather 
        romantic figure in Cambridge, with his flowing hair and his yellow 
        gloves and flowered waistcoats. He worked, however, with great 
        determination and industry, publishing <i>'Hyperion'</i>, a prose 
        romance that foreshadowed his love for Frances Appleton, and <i>'Voices 
        of the Night'</i>, his first book of poems. He journeyed again to 
        Europe, wrote <i>'The Spanish Student'</i>, and took his stand with the 
        abolitionists, returning to be married in 1843.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The marriage was a happy one, and the Longfellow house became the 
        center of life in the University town. The old Craigie House was a 
        shrine of hospitality and gracious living. The young people of Cambridge 
        flocked there to play with the five Longfellow children - two boys, and 
        the three girls whom the poet describes in <i>'The Children's Hour'</i> 
        as &quot;grave Alice and laughing Allegra and Edith with golden hair.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">From his friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, Longfellow got a brief outline 
        of a story from which he composed one of his most favorite poems, 
        'Evangeline'. The original story had Evangeline wandering about New 
        England in search of her bridegroom. Longfellow extended her journey 
        through Louisiana and the western wilderness. She finds Gabriel, at 
        last, dying in Philadelphia.</font></p>
        <p><i><font size="2">'Evangeline'</font></i><font size="2"> was published in 1847 and was widely acclaimed. 
        Longfellow began to feel that his work as a teacher was a hindrance to 
        his own writing. In 1854, he resigned from Harvard and with a great 
        sense of freedom gave himself entirely to the joyous task of his own 
        poetic writing. In June of that year, he began <i>'The Song of Hiawatha'</i>. 
        Henry Schoolcraft's book on Indians and several meetings with an Ojibway 
        chief provided the background for 'Hiawatha'. The long poem begins with 
        Gitche Matino, the Great Spirit, commanding his people to live in peace 
        and tells how Hiawatha is born. It ends with the coming of the white man 
        and Hiawatha's death.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The publication of 'Hiawatha' caused the greatest excitement. For the 
        first time in American literature, Indian themes gained recognition as 
        sources of imagination, power, and originality. The appeal of 'Hiawatha' 
        for generations of children and young people gives it an enduring place 
        in world literature.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The gracious tale of John Alden and Priscilla came next to the poet's 
        mind, and <i>'The Courtship of Miles Standish'</i> was published in 
        1858. It is a work which reflects the ease with which he wrote and the 
        pleasure and enjoyment he derived from his skill. Twenty-five thousand 
        copies were sold during the first week of its publication, and 10,000 
        were ordered in London on the first day of publication.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In 1861, the happy life of the family came to an end. Longfellow's 
        wife died of burns she received when packages of her children's curls, 
        which she wassealing with matches and wax, burst into flame. Longfellow 
        faced the bitterest tragedy of his life. He found some solace in the 
        task of translating Dante into English and went to Europe for a change 
        of scene. The years following were filled with honors. He was given 
        honorary degrees at the great universities of Oxford and Cambridge, 
        invited to Windsor by Queen Victoria, and called by request upon the 
        Prince of Wales. He was chosen a member of the Russian Academy of 
        Sciences and of the Spanish Academy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">When it became necessary to remove &quot;the spreading chestnut tree&quot; of 
        Brattle Street, which Longfellow had written about in his <b>
        <a href="blacksmith.htm" style="text-decoration: none"><i>'Village 
        Blacksmith'</i>,</a></b> the children of Cambridge gave their pennies to 
        build a chair out of the tree and gave it to Longfellow. He died on 
        March 24, 1882. &quot;Of all the suns of the New England morning,&quot; says Van 
        Wyck Brooks, &quot;he was the largest in his golden sweetness.&quot;</font></p>
