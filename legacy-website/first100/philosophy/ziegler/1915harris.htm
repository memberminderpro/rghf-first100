		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">&quot;It is well to know ourselves if 
		only so that we may know<br><br>wherein we may improve ourselves.&quot;<br>
		<br>The Anniversary Address of President Emeritus Paul P. Harris, 
		delivered at the U. S. Central Division Conference at Chicago, 22 
		February, 1915.<br><br>The hopelessness of the undertaking of accurately 
		painting the picture of the Rotary of tomorrow is made doubly apparent 
		when we open our eyes to the fact that even the Rotary of today has 
		never been defined with exactness.<br><br>A man possessing one of the 
		most analytical minds in our organization was recently asked to write an 
		article defining Rotary for publication in a well&#8209;known American 
		magazine and he was forced to acknowledge that the task was far and away 
		beyond his power. He went further than that, he expressed the belief 
		that no one else could define Rotary; and it became necessary for me to 
		shame&#8209;facedly admit that I agreed with his conclusions. I do not wonder 
		that most Rotarians are content to stop with saying that a Rotary Club 
		is an organization whose membership is limited to one representative of 
		each business and profession.<br><br>Until Rotary adopts a permanent and 
		satisfactory explanation of itself, we shall be living in a house 
		without either plan or foundation.<br><br>I feel sure that no one is so 
		blameworthy as myself for this paradoxical condition. I permitted myself 
		to be carried along in the tide of the pleasure of doing things and 
		seeing things done in preference to devoting myself to the more prosaic 
		and less alluring occupation of thinking things. I built my 
		superstructure, but lo, where was my foundation?<br><br>The time when 
		the foundation should have been laid naturally was during the year of my 
		own first administration, long before the organization attained its 
		present vast proportions. The wonder to me has been how Frank 
		Mulholland, Glenn Mead and Russell Greiner ever have succeeded in 
		keeping up with their work at all.<br><br>I believe that there will be 
		an advantage to be gained from a thorough understanding of ourselves, 
		and that it will not be enough to merely find enjoyment and profit in 
		membership.<br><br>It is well to know ourselves if only so that we may 
		know wherein we may improve ourselves.<br><br>I think that we shall 
		certainly know ourselves in the days that are to come, and the fact that 
		we have not become acquainted with ourselves before now may be partially 
		accounted for by the fact that there have been few who have made a 
		profession of Rotary, and that the few who have done so have been so 
		busy with vast volumes of details that they have had little opportunity 
		for introspection.<br><br>Where in the history of the world has any 
		other organization grown really great without the inspiration of a 
		definite, carefully developed and worded faith? Rotary still has much in 
		store for itself.<br><br>Will it not be possible to turn seeming 
		disadvantage into advantage? Will it not eventually redound to the glory 
		of Rotary if now at the beginning of its second decade it really begins 
		to take cognizance of itself and to construct its philosophical 
		foundation?<br><br>Rotarian philosophy need not necessarily be 
		&quot;high&#8209;browed.&quot; Benjamin Franklin's was not and yet it made for the 
		wisdom and elevation of humanity. His aphorisms to this day stand as 
		among the best guides to correct living.<br><br>Men work and play, fight 
		and make peace, love and hate, live and die all in pursuit of happiness, 
		and how often in ill considered pursuit of happiness. Men barter the joy 
		of years for the mirth of a day.<br><br>Rotarian philosophers, let us 
		try to view this thing called life as a whole, look it over, up and 
		down, in and out, and then pick it to pieces, dissect it, analyze, 
		synthesize and understand it.<br><br>The Rotary philosophy need not be 
		hysterical; it can be commonplace, common&#8209;sensed and real. It will be a 
		great boon if it brings to light and adapts to practical everyday life 
		some of the truths which have existed throughout all time. Truth crushed 
		to earth will rise again, but it sometimes takes an unconscionable time 
		to do so because of the vast amount of debris which so called 
		civilization has heaped upon it.<br><br>Mr. big&#8209;hearted, everyday 
		Practical Man be not dismayed. It is no part of my plan to try to impose 
		upon you the duty of sequestering yourself from family and friends daily 
		to read books on philosophy. I wouldn't make you much different from 
		what you are even if it were within my power. It would be a sorry job 
		for me to try to make a poor philosopher out of a good business man. The 
		world has too much work that needs doing by busy men. There are, 
		however, many natural born philosophers in Rotary. A fine school of them 
		has already sprung up and more are coming. They can't help 
		philosophizing and wouldn't if they could because they feel that they 
		have been called to serve.<br><br>But let us know ourselves, Mr. Busy 
		Man, and let us know what we are trying to do. It won't do you any harm, 
		Mr. Busy Man, to devote a little time to the reading of the good things 
		that are written. It may help your business and your enjoyment of life 
		to do so, and it will encourage the writers, and the wife and children 
		will enjoy them. They will help the home life and do the home folks 
		good.<br><br>Rotary owes a great debt to the home folks. I. sometimes 
		wonder if we shall ever be able to repay it all. The thought that club 
		life necessarily takes some things from the home life, which are home 
		life's due, should raise every man of us to a new and keener sense of 
		responsibility. Don't let us even in our most optimistic moments ever 
		get the idea into our heads that it would be good business to barter the 
		love of the home folks for the best thing that any club can offer. The 
		love of the home folks is the one real priceless jewel with which men 
		have been blessed.<br><br>It is my own observation that little progress 
		can be made in any undertaking without system. The efforts of the 
		Rotarian philosophers must be coordinated. President Mulholland has 
		already taken the first long step in that direction. Mr. Mead's 
		committee have made a splendid start.<br><br>Would it be too much to 
		hope for a philosophical convention, or even an annual philosophical 
		convention, where men who have shown particular interest in the 
		philosophy of Rotary may get together undisturbed by entertainment and 
		the rush of business which characterize annual conventions and devote 
		themselves to the development of our Rotarian philosophy? I would love 
		to know that there would some day be a great convention of Rotarian 
		philosophers to, be held well outside the entertainment zone of some 
		centrally located city. It seems to me that it should last at least a 
		week and that it should immediately precede one of our International 
		Conventions; and that the delegates should be chosen by the various 
		clubs and sent at the expense of the various clubs. It also seems to me 
		that the delegates to the convention of Rotarian Philosophers should at 
		the close of their convention elect three of their members who have 
		rendered distinguished service, to attend the International Convention 
		at the expense of the International Association, and there present in 
		concise form for approval or disapproval the result of their 
		deliberations.<br><br>The Rotarian philosophy must ring true. There are 
		no two ways about that. I believe that the trend of Rotarian life is 
		toward higher planes but the planes must never be too high to be 
		genuine. Truth we must have, and if the time comes when we find 
		ourselves sailing in too high an altitude to be safe, then indeed let us 
		get down to earth. Possibly we shall be able to rise again later.<br>
		<br>While we are making a frail attempt to read the horoscope of Rotary 
		let us not overlook the fact that we are growing older and that food for 
		boys is not food for men. It is my own belief that Rotary is already 
		realizing the beneficial effects of maturing age. I believe that a 
		glance at the programs of meetings past and meetings present will 
		convince one that we are growing, not in membership alone but also in 
		realization of the fact that it's a bigger thing to be men than it is to 
		be boys.<br><br>Is it reasonable to suppose that the tendency will 
		cease? No, we shall continue to grow and our view must be increasingly 
		broader as time goes on. Ours has been very much a business view of 
		things. Perhaps we shall soon be ready to take the life view of things, 
		if for no better reason than the desire for originality. Correspondence 
		schools have been rightfully credited with the origination of much which 
		Rotary has adopted. Is Rotary to be satisfied with the reputation of 
		being either one of two things, either entirely void of philosophy or a 
		plagiarist? No, Rotary desires and may have a richer, rarer, broader 
		philosophy than any yet produced.<br><br>Perhaps by oft repeating, even 
		such sterling words as &quot;Service&quot; and such aphorisms as &quot;He Profits Most 
		Who Serves Best&quot; may become trite. This is the age of reason. Men must 
		have opportunity to think for themselves. They will not be satisfied for 
		any great length of time with merely chanting other people's phrases.<br>
		<br>I have tried to think of some destination universally desired, some 
		place to which men of all forms of politics and religion would wish to 
		bend their steps. I see but one upon which the minds of all men can 
		agree and that is the goal of human happiness. I want to suggest to you, 
		President Mulholland, the Selection of happiness as our objective point.<br>
		<br>To the destination of true happiness the path of wholesome pleasure 
		and the path of duty converge.<br><br>He who is most devoted to the 
		pursuit of true happiness will prove to be the most, valuable citizen 
		and he who seeks shall find.<br><br>In a recent letter published in The 
		Rotarian, I attempted to define some of the attributes of true happiness 
		and I also expressed the belief that happiness is the natural heritage 
		of man, conditional only upon the discovery of and the obedience to 
		nature's laws. To express myself again briefly and plainly, I believe 
		that the time will come when all men not only can be happy but will be 
		happy.<br><br>If I am correct in my views, it will mean simply that 
		intelligence will some day dominate the quest of human happiness and 
		that the curtains of night shall be forever drawn upon the darkness of 
		the ignorant past.<br><br>Men work and play, fight and make peace, love 
		and hate, live and die all in pursuit of happiness, and how often in ill 
		considered pursuit of happiness. Men barter the joy of years for the 
		mirth of a day.<br><br>Rotarian philosophers, let us try to view this 
		thing called life as a whole, look it over, up and down, in and out, and 
		then pick it to pieces, dissect it, analyze, synthesize and understand 
		it.<br><br>You have never thought of such a thing as deliberately, 
		seriously planning life's campaign with the end in view of obtaining 
		even for you a full quota of life's happiness.<br><br>I am convinced 
		that the men of the future will know much more than they do at present 
		about how to make happiness; in fact, we do already know much more than 
		we did in the days of the past. The change, of a decade may not be 
		noticeable &#8209; but the change of a century is.<br><br>May the Rotarian 
		philosophy of tomorrow live to resurrect and adapt to its day and age 
		some of the homespun lore of long ago. May Rotarian influences tend to 
		appreciate the simplicities of life and to depreciate its unnerving 
		complexities.<br><br>We have done some things for business life, let us 
		do more for the home life. May the new Rotarian philosophy of life be 
		passed on to future generations through the medium of the Rotarian wife, 
		mother and the little ones who gather at her knee until it holds a place 
		in the very sub consciousness of men.<br><br>Let us re&#8209;dedicate 
		ourselves in the brighter light, the broader way, the truer life to the 
		goal of human happiness, the rightful heritage of him who is honorable 
		in business and whose life is wholesome, just and right. <br><br>
