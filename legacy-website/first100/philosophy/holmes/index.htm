    <p align="left"><font size="2">At once a well-known and easily mistaken 
    identity, this name has meaning for the literary, legal, and medical 
    communities the world over. This page is offered as a starting point for 
    those who would like to know more of the Oliver Wendell Holmes's, the 
    family, and their works. A brief introduction will be useful. Let's start 
    from a point just about two hundred years ago, with a minister of religion 
    (who was also an author) named Abiel Holmes (1763-1837). His second wife, 
    Sarah Wendell, and he had five children: Mary, Ann, Sarah, Oliver and John. 
    This first Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809-1894), doubtless somewhat influenced 
    by family precedent, became a physician. <b>
    <a href="nautilus.htm" style="text-decoration: none">He also became a writer</a></b>, 
    and was much in demand as a speaker. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">Doctor Oliver Wendell Holmes married Amelia 
    Lee Jackson when he was thirty. They had three children: Oliver Wendell, Jr. 
    (1841-1935), Amelia Jackson Holmes, and Edward Jackson Holmes. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">In 1875, Dr. Holmes was chosen to be the 
    first President of the Boston Medical Library, remaining such until 1888 
    when he resigned primarily to meet his growing literary commitments. In the 
    following year, Dr. Holmes gave nearly one thousand medical books to the 
    Boston Medical Library, together with the shelving necessary to make them 
    available to readers. Dr. Holmes worked on a stereoscope, he introduced the 
    use of the microscope into the medical curriculum and was interested in the 
    Boston Microscopical Society. He must have been popular with his children 
    and their friends: it's said he enjoyed free passes to Phineas Barnum's 
    circus! Descriptions of his travels are absorbing. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2">The second Oliver (to be known as Wendell) 
    also followed some family footsteps, but into law, later becoming the Chief 
    Justice of Massachusetts' Supreme Court, and eventually a United States 
    Supreme Court Associate Justice. Wendell, too, was known for his writing.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></td>

		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the age of twenty he graduated at 
          Harvard University, then took up the study of law. This study, 
          however, was soon abandoned for medicine. He studied in Europe for a 
          short time, and took his degree as doctor of medicine at Cambridge, in 
          1836. Two years later he was appointed to the chair of Anatomy and 
          Physiology in Dartmouth College. This position he held till 1847, when 
          he accepted a similar position at Harvard, which he held till 1892. 
          All of his literary work was performed in addition to the labors of a 
          continuous professorship in college of about forty-seven years.<br>
		<br>Holmes' literary tastes were early indicated by his comic and satiric 
          verse contributed to &quot;<i>The Collegian</i>.&quot; These were excellent of 
          their kind. In his early works, the mirth so often outweighed the 
          sentiment as to lessen the promise and the self-prediction of his 
          being a poet indeed. While many of his youthful stanzas are serious 
          and elegant, those which approach the feeling of true poetry are in 
          celebration of companionship and good cheer. He seemed to exemplify 
          what Emerson was wont to preach, that there is honest wisdom in song 
          and joy. He contributed numerous pieces to American periodicals, and 
          in 1836 collected his poems into a volume. His life was not marked by 
          any noted events, but it was like the steady movement of a great 
          river. It grew broader and deeper in each mile of its progress. 
          &quot;Holmes was a shining instance of one who did solid work as a teacher 
          and practitioner, in spite of his success in literature.&quot; &quot;<i>Poetry</i>,&quot; 
          a metrical essay, was followed by &quot;<i>Terpsichore</i>,&quot; a poem; in 
          1846, &quot;Urania,&quot; in 1850, &quot;<i>Astreea</i>,&quot; &quot;<i>The Balance of 
          Allusions</i>,&quot; a poem. These poems were first delivered before 
          college and literary societies.<br><br></font>

   face="Arial" size="2">Though 
          the most direct and obvious of the Cambridge group, the least 
          given to subtleties, he was our typical university poet; the minstrel 
          of the college that bred him, and within whose liberties he taught, 
          jested, sung, and toasted, from boyhood to what in common folk would 
          be old age. Alma Mater was more to him than to Lowell or Longfellow, 
          and not until he came into her estate could Harvard boast a natural 
          songster as her laureate. Two centuries of acclimation, and some 
          experience of liberty, probably were needed to germinate the fancy 
          that riots in his measures. Before his day, moreover, the sons of the 
          Puritans hardly were ripe for the doctrine that there is a time to 
          laugh, that humor is quite as helpful a constituent of life as gravity 
          or gloom. Provincial-wise, they at first had to receive this in its 
          cruder form, and relished heartily the broad fun of Holmes' youthful 
          verse. Their mirth-maker soon perceived that both fun and feeling are 
          heightened when combined. The poet of '<i>The Last Leaf'</i> was among 
          the first to teach his countrymen that pathos is an equal part of true 
          humor; that sorrow is lightened by jest, and jest redeemed from 
          coarseness by emotion, under most conditions of this our evanescent 
          human life.&quot;</font></p>

        <font face="Arial" size="2">Turning his attention to prose, he 
        published, in 1858, &quot;T<i>he Autocrat of the Breakfast Table</i>,&quot; a 
        series of light and genial essays full of fancy and humor, which has 
        been successful both in the New and Old World. It appears that this work 
        was planned in his youth; but we owe to his maturity the experience, 
        drollery, proverbial humor, and suggestion that flow at ease through its 
        pages. Little was too high or too low for the comment of this down-east 
        philosopher. A kind of attenuated Franklin, he viewed things and folks 
        with the less robustness, but with keener distinction and insight. His 
        pertinent maxims are so frequent that it seems, as was said of Emerson, 
        as if he had jotted them down from time to time and here first brought 
        them to application; they are apothegms of common life and action, often 
        of mental experience, strung together by a device to original as to make 
        the work quite a novelty in literature. The Autocrat holds an 
        intellectual tourney at a boarding-house table; there, jousts against 
        humbug and stupidity, gives light touches of knowledge, sentiment, 
        illustration, coins here and there a phrase destined to be long current, 
        nor forgets the poetic duty of providing a little idyl of human love and 
        interest.<br>
        <br>
        This was followed by &quot;<i>The Professor at the Breakfast Table</i>,&quot; and 
        later by &quot;<i>The Poet at the Breakfast Table</i>.&quot; &quot;<i>The Professor</i>&quot; 
        is written somewhat in the manner of Sterne, yet without much artifice. 
        The story of Iris is an interwoven thread of gold. The poems in this 
        book are inferior to those of the Autocrat, but its author here and 
        there shows a gift of drawing real characters; the episode of the Little 
        Gentleman is itself a poem,--its close very touching, though imitated 
        from the death scene in Tristram Shandy. &quot;<i>The Poet at the Breakfast 
        Table</i>,&quot; written some years after, is of a more serious cast than its 
        predecessors, chiefly devoted to Holmes' peculiar mental speculations 
        and his fluent gossip on books and learning. He makes his rare old 
        pundit a liberal thinker, clearly of the notion that a high scholarship 
        leads to broader views.<br>
        <br>
        Between the second and third of the &quot;<i>Autocrat</i>&quot; series, appeared, 
        in 1861, &quot;<i>Elsie Venner</i>,&quot; and in 1868, &quot;<i>The Guardian Angel</i>,&quot; 
        two excellent novels. Then, in 1872, he published &quot;<i>Mechanism in 
        Thought and Morals</i>.&quot; He is also author of a valuable medical work, 
        and of numerous essays and poems of value.<br>
        <br>
        When the civil war broke out, this conservative poet, who had taken 
        little part in the agitation that preceded it, shared in every way the 
        spirit and duties of the time. None of our poets wrote more stirring war 
        lyrics during the conflict; none was more national so far as loyalty, in 
        a Websterian sense, to our country and her emblem is concerned. He 
        always displayed the simple, instinctive patriotism of the American 
        minute-man. He may or may not have sided with his neighbors, but he was 
        for the nation. His pride was not of English, but of long American 
        descent.<br>
        <br>
        Than Holmes, no one has written a greater number of short beautiful 
        poems, that are on every tongue. When a noted American ship was declared 
        unseaworthy, and about to be abandoned, our poet came forward with a 
        magnificent poem, entitled &quot;<i>Old Ironsides</i>,&quot; that gave that fine 
        old ship a half century of preservation.<br>
        <br>
        But he gave us some of the best thoughts. Many of his 
        sayings must stand among the finest specimens of American wit and humor; 
        and his writings, as a whole, will always be classed </font><style="font-size: 9pt"><a href="owh10.gif">
