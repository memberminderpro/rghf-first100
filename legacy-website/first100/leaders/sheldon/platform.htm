		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">The following year at the second 
		convention, in Portland, Oregon, Seattle members 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/skeel/index.htm">Ernie Skeel</a>, Roy Denny 
		and Jim Pinkham were in attendance.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="137" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/sheldon/images/skeel.gif" style="float: left" width="103">Skeel and Pinkham were 
		personally responsible for the Rotary Platform proposed the year before. 
		Denny, as national vice-president, presided over several of the 
		sessions. Jim Pinkham was chair of the Resolutions Committee, and had 
		brought the Seattle platform to the floor of the convention for 
		discussion and a vote. The ensuing discussion had been ambivalent, and 
		Pinkham had resisted a vote, presumably in fear that it would not pass.<br>
		<br>
		At that point, a report by the Committee on Business Methods, 
		authored by Chicago member Arthur Sheldon, was read. Sheldon was unable 
		to attend the Portland convention, but had submitted the report, which 
		contained the phrase &quot;He 
		<img class="auto-style26" height="137" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/sheldon/images/denny.gif" style="float: left" width="102">profits most who serves best.&quot; The previous 
		year, Sheldon had attended the 1910 convention in Chicago, and had 
		spoken a similar phrase to the assembled delegates, &quot;He profits most who 
		serves his fellows best.&quot;<br><br>When the reading of the Business 
		Methods report was finished, Pinkham jumped to his feet and said, &quot;Here 
		is a positive affirmation packaged in six words. Those words should be 
		put into Rotary's platform.&quot; The conventioneers agreed with a thunderous 
		round of applause and a standing ovation. The Rotary Platform passed by 
		acclamation on a voice vote.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="137" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/sheldon/images/pinkham.gif" style="float: left" width="104">Pinkham had become a firm believer 
		that businesses should be conducted not just for profit, but also to 
		benefit society at large. As chair of the Resolutions Committee, he 
		said, &quot;Rotary membership is both a responsibility and a privilege. If 
		one is met and the other used the result will be progressive efforts for 
		good. He profits most who serves best.&quot;<br><br>The final version of the 
		original Rotary platform, approved by the 1911 delegates, became the 
		basis of the organization in the United States, as well as those clubs 
		that were formed in American colonies in foreign countries. It follows:<br>
		<br>“Recognizing the commercial basis of modern life as a necessary 
		incident in human evolution, the Rotary Club is organized to express the 
		proper relation between private interests and the fusion of private 
		interests which constitutes society.<br><br>“To accomplish this purpose 
		more effectively, the principle of limited membership has been adopted, 
		the Rotary Club consisting of one representative from each distinct line 
		of business or profession. Each member is benefited by contact with 
		representative men engaged in different occupations and is enabled 
		there-by to meet more intelligently the responsibilities of civic and 
		business life.<br><br>“The basis of club membership insures the 
		representation of all interests and the domination of none, in the 
		consideration of public questions relating to business. On account of 
		its limited membership the Rotary Club does not constitute itself the 
		voice of the entire community on questions of general importance, but 
		its action on such questions is of great influence in advancing the 
		civic and business welfare of the community.<br><br>“The Rotary Club 
		demands fair dealings, honest methods, and high standards in business. 
		No obligation, actual or implied, to influence business exists in 
		Rotary. Election to membership therein is an expression of confidence of 
		the club in the member elected, and of its good will toward him. As his 
		business is an expression of himself, he is expected to represent it.<br>
		<br>“Membership in the Rotary Club is a privilege and an opportunity and 
		its responsibility demands honest and efficient service and 
		thoughtfulness for one's fellows.<br><br><strong>“Service is the basis of all 
		business. He profits most who serves best.”</strong><br><br>In hindsight, 
		many have seen the reading of Sheldon’s phrase and Pinkham’s response as 
		a defining moment in the development of Rotary. &quot;He profits most who 
		serves best&quot; served Rotary for over half a century. It also played a 
		major role in the evolution of Rotary from a business-oriented 
		organization to a community service organization, a change that would 
		commence within the decade.<br><br>Editor/Publisher Chesley Perry, in 
		the October 1913 issue of The Rotarian on page 5 of that issue, said, 
		“Rotary had a raison d'etre with which to challenge the admiration of 
		the world.<br><br>“Service is the watchword of Rotary today and forever 
		more. In service is truth, for how can one serve well if not truly. In 
		service is efficiency, for how may one expect his service to be of value 
		unless it be efficient. And when one feels the impulse of service, how 
		great and how numerous are the opportunities. For countless ages, men 
		seem to have thought they had to have some special commission in order 
		to be able to do something worth while-some office, some rank, that they 
		had to be anointed as of the priesthood before any opportunity for 
		service was open to them.<br><br>The “Rotary Platform” is essentially 
		unchanged today. Its major differences are the concessions made to the 
		role of women in Society and Rotary. It can be found here.<br><br>
