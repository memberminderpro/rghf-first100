		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/roth/ppt.htm">PowerPoint presentation</a>, showing the many, many areas where Rotary 
		began, with the assistance of Jim Roth - <br><br>this remarkable work 
		was created by RGHF member Jorge Arman Also see extract from &quot;the First 
		Rotarian&quot; by James P. Walsh <br><br>A PERSONAL INTRODUCTION TO JAMES H. 
		F. ROTH - <br><br>Rotarian Extraordinaire <br><br>James Henry Francis 
		Roth, best known as Jim Roth (or Don Jim), was born in Ventura, 
		California, and died in his hometown at the age of 81 years.He studied 
		at the Ventura Grammar School and founded the gymnasium in Ventura High 
		School. In 1906, two weeks after he graduated, he was working as a 
		secretary to a former judge of the Supreme Court, traveling and studying 
		law at the same time. During his early years he took other positions as 
		Paymaster, Accountant and General Trading. With his high level of 
		culture, acquired by his travels around the world, he spoke fluent 
		Portuguese, French, German and Spanish, in addition to his homeland 
		language.<br><br>In 1914, at the age of only 27, he became 
		representative of a large coffee dealer in the state of Sonora, Mexico, 
		where he remained only a year.<br><br>James said that since childhood, 
		he had wanted to represent his country and therefore, wrote to the U.S. 
		Department of State to enquire about the possibilities of entering the 
		U.S. diplomatic service.&quot;It would be unforgivable, at the close of this 
		snapshot of the settlement of Rotary in Brazil, to omit the name of the 
		kind, clever, dynamic and efficient Jim Roth, an official of Rotary 
		International with specific allocation to expand the network of Rotary 
		Clubs, structure it and excite, guide and disseminate the spirit of 
		service, heart and motor of the purposes of Rotary to promote 
		understanding between nations. Jim, from the 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/districts/districts/5240/Ventura.htm">Rotary Club of Ventura</a>, 
		California, approximately 40 years, came to Brazil in 1928. Traveled 
		280,000 km, the service of Rotary; organized and founded 83 Rotary Clubs 
		and helped in the founding of 12, totaling 95. <br><br>Organized and 
		oversaw the wheels district conferences held here during their stay, 
		since the first of District 63 (Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay), in Rio 
		de Janeiro in 1929. There was asked how many problems with his personal 
		magnetism and conciliatory spirit. He gathered extensive to the 
		Secretariat of Rotary International in 1942 and, shortly after, is 
		retired. <br><br>I had the privilege to know him, when the RC-Irati 
		founded in 1941.&quot;This paragraph extracted from a paper by Alberto Olavo 
		de Carvalho, Brazil.<br><br>WELCOME TO SOUTH AMERICA <br><br>After 
		receiving his Bachelor Degree, he was admitted to trade at the age of 19 
		years, being appointed guardian of the J.K. Armsby Company, now the 
		California Packing Company (one of the largest such companies in the 
		U.S.) in its reputable business of preserved fruit, fish, dried fruits, 
		nuts, beans, etc.<br><br>He was with them seven and a half years and 
		then went to Mexico for one year as representative of American firms. He 
		then entered the United States Consular Service where he was worked for 
		more than 10 years, taking consular posts in Guayaquil in Ecuador, Lima 
		in Peru (the consular jurisdiction in 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/countries/equador/index.htm">Guayaquil</a> covered Ecuador and Peru 
		in Lima), and Pernambuco and Manaus in Brazil. In 1925 he was appointed 
		Special Representative of Rotary International in Spain and Portugal (he 
		had organized the Rotary Club of Lima while he was consul in that city) 
		and in 1926 received the appointment of Special Commissioner of Rotary 
		International.In December 1915, he was appointed vice consul in the city 
		of Guayaquil, Ecuador.<br><br>On entering the Rotary organization, he 
		resigned his post in the United States Consul. He organized the first 
		Rotary clubs in Portugal, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, San 
		Salvador and Costa Rica and countless clubs in other countries where 
		Rotary already existed. For more than 27 months he toured Central and 
		South America in forming Rotary clubs.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now in the country is 
		the special commissioner of Rotary International, Mr James H. Roth.Roth, 
		comes with the purpose of assisting in the installation of new clubs in 
		South America. In respect to Argentina, Mr. Roth has been completely 
		available to the governor and gamin Club Buenos Aires, to intensify the 
		campaign accordingly.<br><br>After a few days in our country, which 
		served to exchange ideas about the best way to guide the campaign plan, 
		Don James departed for Asuncion in order to establish the first club 
		Rotarians in Paraguay, then returned here to continue the work 
		indicated. <br><br>We are confident that his presence will be very 
		beneficial, not only because of the momentum that will give the 
		extension Rotarians, but because his enthusiasm and energy are spread 
		easily. Moreover, Don James is an individual treatment pleasant, 
		interesting conversation and a good comrade with whom he was sympathetic 
		from the outset.<br><br>&quot;The above report from &quot;The Chronicle of 
		Rotarians Argentino&quot;. October 1927Jim arrived in Brazil in August 1921, 
		starting work in the consulate of Recife, for a year and a half. He was 
		later transferred to Manaus, where, after another year and a half as 
		vice-consul, he requested removal from office to deal with emotional 
		problems caused by the death of his mother, and returned to 
		California. He returned after his compassionate leave and recommenced 
		working in various consulates.<br><br>He served in his consular career 
		for 10 years, in the cities of Guayaquil (Ecuador), Lima (Peru), Recife 
		and Manaus (Brazil).The first direct link by Jim Roth with Rotary 
		International was during his stay in the city of Lima Peru, where, at 
		the request of the Peruvian Ambassador in Washington, Sr. Frederico 
		Alfonso Pezet and Fernando Carbajal (who later became President of 
		Rotary International in the Rotary Year 1942-1943), he assisted in the 
		organisation of the 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/southamerica/lima/index.htm">Rotary Club of Lima</a>. He discussed all these matters 
		with the Secretary of Rotary International, Chesley Perry, during a 
		meeting in 1921.<br><br>In 1925, he received a telegram inviting him to 
		a Rotary mission in Spain and Portugal for an initial period of 6 
		months. He accepted the invitation and with this new venture, met the 
		challenges with enthusiasm and dedication. Also in 1925, Jim was received 
		in audience by Pope Pius XI and conferred with the assistant secretary 
		of the Vatican State, Bishop Pizzardo, on matters relating to Rotary and 
		its relationship with the church.<br><br>ROTARY REPRESENTATIVE<br><br>
		Thence began his 17 years of service as Representative of Rotary 
		International in Europe and Latin America.After a year of service in 
		Europe, he came to Latin America in order to expand the Rotary clubs and 
		assist in hosting and &quot;helped&quot; to create an unequalled number of clubs 
		in an unequalled number of countries.The following is a list of 
		countries where Jim was directly or indirectly responsible for the 
		creation of Rotary Clubs.<br><br>(His involvement in their creation is 
		apparently documented in the historical papers of all clubs listed - 
		Greg Barlow)<br><br>More short Club stories as they are found</td>
