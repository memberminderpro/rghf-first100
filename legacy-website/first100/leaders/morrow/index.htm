		Morrow, a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin emigrated in 1885 to 
		California. He became an early member of the second Rotary club.
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/cities/clubs/02sanfrancisco.htm">
		San Francisco #2</a> during its first year. Following the dissolution of 
		his business there, he decided to return to his family in Ireland. <br>
		<br>One of the early members of the San Francisco Club was William 
		Stuart Morrow who joined the club in 1908. Originally from Dublin, 
		Ireland, Morrow attended Trinity College, Dublin, where one of his 
		fellow undergraduates was the writer Oscar Wilde. He went on to become 
		the youngest ever Justice of the Peace at that time in Britain, but 
		emigrated to the USA, finally settling in California in 1885. <br><br>
		Two years after becoming a Rotarian (Classification: Law and Collections<a href="index.htm#[1]">[1]</a>), 
		Stuart Morrow decided to move back to Britain, initially to Dublin. <br>
		<br>Morrow was a lonely man, and was clearly influenced by the West 
		Coast Rotary concept of 'Boosting' that was responsible for initial 
		Rotary growth and much regretted by the founder of the movement in 
		Chicago. These first Rotary Clubs were mainly an association of 
		businessmen giving trade to each other as well as enjoying mutual 
		friendship, and Morrow saw this, not only as an opportunity for others 
		but also as an opportunity for himself. Morrow had never actually met 
		Paul Harris and it seems that his drive came from the reality of 
		boosting which outweighed the ethic of service at a time when Rotary's 
		direction (if any) was not yet decided.<a href="index.htm#[2]">[2]</a> The '<a href="index.htm#Rotarys_Code_of_Ethics">Booster</a>' 
		club ethos was much maligned by
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/library/critics/index.htm">
		early critics of Rotary</a>.<br><br>Morrow possibly adapted his approach 
		to Rotary recruitment from the so-called 'Collecting Agent', Herbert 
		Quick in Los Angeles, who sold memberships to the unofficial National 
		Rotary Club of Los Angeles. As one Rotary historian put it, &quot;If Rotary's 
		burgeoning Constitution would have allowed it, Quick would have been 
		lynched&quot;.<a href="index.htm#[3]">[3]</a><br><br>David Shelley Nicholl's 
		entertaining analysis of the Rotary Movement 'The Golden Wheel' 
		dedicates a whole chapter to Morrow entitled 'The Medicine Man' and 
		begins with a delicious little poem that manipulates Arthur Sheldon's 
		famous Rotary motto:-<br>In serving others I can profit most, “I am a 
		friend to man”; that is my boast.<a href="index.htm#[4]">[4]</a><br><br>Morrow 
		returned penniless to his native Ireland after a business failure. On 
		his arrival in Dublin, he began discussions with his brother-in-law, 
		Bill McConnell and began interesting local businessmen in the idea of 
		forming a Rotary Club. On February 11, 1911, the Dublin Club was formed 
		with Morrow as organizing secretary with a salary of 9 guineas. Within a 
		couple of months, however, he had moved North to start a similar 
		enterprise in Belfast, the inaugural meeting being held there on July 
		24, 1911 where he was given an office, secretary and telephone. The 
		Belfast Club grew to 124 members by January 1912. Neither of these 
		developments was known to Paul Harris or to the National Association of 
		Rotary Clubs in America, and as a result neither club received an 
		official charter at the time of their foundation. (see '<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/ireland-uk/chartering.htm">Chartering</a>') 
		&nbsp;When Harris and Ches Perry finally heard about these clubs, they 
		contacted Morrow and authorized him to continue his work. In his 
		fast-paced movement around the British Isles, his next two clubs, in 
		1912, were Glasgow and Edinburgh, and the following year, Liverpool and 
		Birmingham, making two in Ireland, two in Scotland and finally two in 
		England.<br><br>Meanwhile, two official representatives of Rotary, 
		Arthur Sheldon and his London representative E. Sayer Smith had formed 
		clubs in London and Manchester, bringing the total in Britain to eight, 
		six of which had been started through the work of Stuart Morrow.<br><br>
		As part of his work in starting new clubs and introducing new members to 
		existing clubs, Morrow retained a proportion of either the entrance or 
		membership fee. Effectively, as James Walsh points out, he became &quot;a 
		paid organizer&quot;. The Liverpool Club records that Morrow was paid a 
		guinea a week as organizing secretary and a further guinea for every new 
		member he introduced. He would organize the Liverpool Club in a record 
		fortnight. He was also taken on by the London Club to recruit new 
		members at a pound a time; for this he was nicknamed 'Old Pound a Nob'. 
		Morrow successfully recruited for the London Rotary club and also set up 
		Rotary's London Bureau in The Strand for visiting Rotarians.<br><br>
		Morrow's new Rotary Clubs eventually fell out with their emissary and 
		abandoned “Morotary”<a href="index.htm#[5]">[5]</a> to embrace the purity of 
		Harris’s message- and saved themselves a few guineas in the process! 
		Edinburgh, like other clubs, sent Morrow packing with a 10 guineas 
		'golden handshake' in &quot;appreciation&quot; for his work. Most clubs felt 
		uneasy with Morrow's stunts and attitude. For example, the first British 
		clubs had real problems with calling other members by their first name.<br>
		<br>Stuart Morrow should not be disregarded as some kind of 
		carpetbagger. His travels had to be financed and he never hid his need 
		to recover some of his expenses. On leaving Glasgow, he told his 
		audience in a talk entitled 'The Aims of Rotary other than commercial', 
		&quot;It is distinctly within the province of a Rotary Club to take notice of 
		dishonorable business methods, and non-ethical standards, with a view to 
		their elimination&quot;. Perry and Harris had this talk printed in 'The 
		Rotarian'.<br><br>Resolution 15 of the Rotary Convention in Houston, 
		Texas 1914 wished to &quot;express the appreciation of the International 
		Association of Rotary Clubs to Mr. W Stuart Morrow for his work in 
		organizing Rotary Clubs in Great Britain and Ireland&quot;..<br>As with the 
		other Morrow Clubs, some of his activities were not to the liking of the 
		London Club and in 1914 he returned to the United States. There, he is 
		credited with founding the Soroptimists movement with the creation of 
		their first club in Oakland in 1921. He died in California aged 87.<br>
		<br>Although a club in Winnipeg had been opened in November 1910, just 3 
		months before Dublin, it was Stuart Morrow, who by his work in Britain, 
		had clearly spread the idea of Rotary beyond the boundaries of North 
		America Thus, at the Convention of 1912, a new name was decided upon, 
		'The International Association of Rotary Clubs'. We could now say that 
		Stuart Morrow was the man who made Rotary International.<br>&nbsp;<br>

		University Group Looks at the Rotary Club of Chicago' <br><br>Footnote<br>
		<br>Roger Levy records a speech made by Morrow in Glasgow “The two 
		essential features of a Rotary Club are: first, that the membership 
		should be confined to one representative of each profession or business: 
		and, second, that the primary object of the club should be the promotion 
		of the business interests of the members.”<br>After asking those members 
		who had earned business they would not have attained “but for” joining 
		the Club to put up their hands – almost all did - Morrow went on. “That 
		is sufficient proof that the Glasgow Rotary Club is successfully 
		carrying out its primary object”.<br><br>Basil Lewis &amp; Cal Thomson<br>

		<br>The Rotary Club of San Francisco records in &quot;Seventy-Five Years in 
		San Francisco&quot; &quot;With these successes, Rotarians back in the United 
		States began making plans to send morrow to Australia and New Zealand to 
		carry on the good work. Unfortunately, as club historian Mountin 
		(William J.) reveals, Morrow lost the support of his fellow clubmen when 
		they discovered that 'he was making his living by selling memberships 
		for a guinea apiece.'&quot;<br><br>The Rotary Club of Chicago in their book 
		&quot;The Golden Strand&quot; note Paul's support of Morrow's work with no mention 
		of the controversy.<br><br>A history of District 1160<br><br>The idea of 
		Rotary was brought to Ireland by William Stuart Morrow, who returned 
		from the United States to his native land in 1911 - just six years after 
		the first Rotary meeting in Chicago in 1905. In conjunction with his 
		brother-in-law, William A. McConnell, Morrow formed the Dublin Club 
		(22nd February, 1911), after which he moved north where he brought into 
		being the Club of Belfast (24th July, 1911) </td>
