								With the passing of Silvester Schiele on 
								December 17, 1945, thousands upon thousands of 
								individuals, both Rotarians and non-Rotarians 
								had lost one of their dearest friends.<br><br>
								Hundreds of Crippled children owe their 
								rehabilitation to the pioneering educational 
								work of Silvester. Hundreds upon hundreds of 
								young men, sore pressed for adjustment in the 
								depression days give thanks for the privilege of 
								having been befriended by Silvester. there are 
								thousands of folks in this world of challenges 
								who are striving to emulate the sterling 
								qualities always exhibited by Silvester.<br><br>
								Truly he was one of the great men of the 20th 
								Century, for greatness must come as a result of 
								personal contacts, of helpfulness, of square 
								dealing, and of kindly sympathetic 
								understanding.<br><br>Silvester was an idealist, 
								but at the same time a man of practical affairs. 
								He was first of all a success in his home life, 
								for in 1909 he was married to Jessie L. 
								MacDonald, of Michigan, who was his constant 
								partner in good works in the city of Chicago, 
								IL. The two were a great tam of personal 
								service.<br><br>Silvester was a success in 
								business. He was Christian businessman, having 
								been president of the Schiele Coal Company from 
								1902 to 1939, when he retired. His employees 
								held him in high regard.<br><br>Silvester 
								Schiele was a success in the things of life that 
								really count. Mundane accomplishments are 
								essential in this world of competitive 
								enterprise, but the competitor can have great 
								respect, and this was true of all those in 
								Silvester's field of activity. His real 
								greatness was for everywhere men had a good word 
								for Silvester, perhaps because he had a good 
								word and a great heart for them.<br><br>He was 
								what many like to think of as a typical 
								American. He was born of German parentage in a 
								log cabin in Clay City, Indiana, in 1870. He 
								slept in the attic while the snow crept in the 
								chinks between the logs. He broke ice out of the 
								pitcher to get water for the morning wash. He 
								had all the difficulties of a young pioneer. 
								There was the family fireplace of those early 
								years, which was an important training ground. 
								Then there was school at Terre Haute, a period 
								of service in Cuba in the Spanish-American War, 
								and then activity in Chicago in the retail coal 
								business.<br><br>
								About 1896 he had loaned some money to a friend 
								from who he had been unable to collect. Passing 
								by his office frequently was a young lawyer and 
								one day Silvester asked this young lawyer for 
								advice as to the collection of the money.

						  <td class="auto-style24" valign="top" width="50%">

								Thus began the friendship of Paul Harris and 
								Silvester that was to result in the founding of 
								the Rotary Club of Chicago as the forerunner of 
								the more than 31,000 Clubs throughout the world 
								today and, indeed, of the thousands of other 
								service clubs of the 20th Century.<br><br>
								In the early days of the century Paul and Silvester 
								shared a room in the New Southern Hotel at 13th 
								Street and Michigan in Chicago. On Sundays in 
								top hats and Prince Albert coats, they would 
								stroll down the boulevard to church and in the 
								afternoon they would walk to the park.<br><br>
								This Damon and Pythias friendship was to weather 
								all storms of disagreement, and constantly 
								ripen. In his latter years Silvester was a 
								constant companion of Paul as was his wife, 
								Jessie, to Paul's wife, Jean--an inseparable 
								foursome. Paul said that Silvester's life became 
								increasingly useful in advancing years.<br><br>
								As the co-founder of Rotary, Silvester became 
								the first President of the first Rotary Club. 
								After some five months of existence, Silvester 
								suggested to Paul that the members give talks 
								about their businesses and Paul asked Silvester 
								to make the first talk. Thus was presented the 
								first Vocational Service talk in Rotary, a 
								practice that has now become universal.<br><br>
								He was a community-minded man interested in 
								working with boys, he knew the problem's, which 
								confronted young men and hence became a natural 
								counselor for them. Hundreds cam for advice and 
								it was always given freely but in humility.<br>
								<br>Because Silvester himself was an idealist, 
								it was perfectly natural that the altruistic 
								service program of Rotary would appeal deeply to 
								him. Any movement, which is to become great, 
								must have an altruistic idealism in the hearts 
								and minds of its founders. The idealism of Paul 
								and Silvester was the very practical cornerstone 
								on which the great structure of Rotary 
								International was ultimately to be built.<br>
								<br>Silvester left this life in active service 
								to Rotary International, he was serving as the 
								international Treasurer. Having been asked by 
								the Board of Directors to become Treasurer, his 
								comment was simply, if I can be of service I 
								would gladly accept.<br><br>His was an indelible 
								impression, as the minister said at the funeral 
								service, Silvester didn't have a Sunday 
								profession and a Monday practice. He was a man 
								of honor and righteousness, which is no mean 
								achievement in these hectic days. His whole life 
								was quiet, humble, unobtrusive, and persuasive 
								goodness. A great Rotarian, his good deeds and 
								noble thoughts will live forever in the hearts 
								and minds of those who knew him.<br>
