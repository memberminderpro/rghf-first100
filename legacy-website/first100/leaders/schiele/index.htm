		served during the <br>Spanish American War which began in April 1898 and

		The likelihood is therefore that it was either taken just before

								Germany before immigrating to America and 
								landing in New York in the spring of 1852. From 
								there the family went to Montgomery County, 
								Pennsylvania where there were already many 
								German settlers; the 'Pennsylvania Dutch' or 
								more properly 'Deutsch'. According to one 
								account (1), the family moved on in 1854 to 
								Medina County, West of Akron, Ohio and seven 
								years later to Indiana. There, after a short 
								stay in Owen County, near to Bloomington, the 
								Schiele’s finally crossed the county boundary to 
								Harrison Township in Clay County, Indiana. 
								Although trained in Germany as a shoemaker, 
								Michael Schiele, Silvester's father, also took 
								up farming and by 1888 was the owner of a large 
								and prosperous 220 acre farm.<br><br>After 
								Michael's first wife Mary died, he married 
								Elizabeth Krieble from Montgomery, PA on 
								February 12, 1867. Of their 9 children, 
								Silvester was the second, born on June 29, 1870 
								(2). His obituary in 'The Rotarian' records, in 
								1946, that &quot;He was born ....in a log cabin in 
								Clay City, Indiana. He had all the difficulties 
								of a young pioneer.&quot; (3) . Since his parents , 
								were certainly living there at the time, this 
								makes sense. However, according to the IGI, the 
								birth took place in Pennsylvania, but no record 
								of this event has so far been found. The 1880 
								Census of Clay County in Indiana records that 
								Silvester was born in Indiana and the I.G.I. 
								attribution appears to be incorrect.<br><br>
								Silvester attended school in Terre Haute. 
								Service in the military during the Spanish 
								American war was followed by a move to Chicago. 
								There Silvester involved himself in the coal 
								trade, perhaps using contacts from the mining 
								areas of Indiana. The story has often been told 
								about how in 1896, he found himself unable to 
								recover 20 dollars which he had loaned to a 
								friend. Passing by his coal office frequently 
								was a young lawyer, and one day Silvester asked 
								this young lawyer to help him collect the money. 
								The lawyer was Paul Harris and thus began a 
								friendship between the two men which continued 
								for the next 50 years.<br><br>Schiele and Harris 
								even shared a hotel room in those early years of 
								the century when both were still bachelors. They 
								often dined together at 
								<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/711/background/galli.htm">Madame Galli's</a> where, on 
								February 23, 1905, the 'gang of four' met to 
								discuss the formation of what later became the 
								Rotary movement.</td>
						  <td class="auto-style24" valign="top" width="50%">
								In 1909, Silvester married Jessie MacDonald of 
								Michigan who was to assist him throughout their 
								life together. The two couples, Paul and Jean 
								Harris, and Silvester and Jessie Schiele became 
								great friends and neighbors as well as often 
								holidaying together. In death the two men lie 
								close to each other in the Mount Hope Cemetery. 
								(see below) It was Silvester who suggested to 
								Paul that each of the members of the new club 
								should give a talk about their business, thereby 
								starting a tradition for new members which 
								continues to this day. Silvester had become a 
								successful and Christian businessman, and was 
								President of the Schiele Coal Company from 1902 
								until he retired in 1939.<br><br>His work and 
								life in Rotary is chronicled elsewhere, however 
								it can be noted here that Silvester Schiele 
								became the first President of the Chicago Club 
								and remained involved in Rotary throughout his 
								life. He did not take any international office 
								until July 1945, when he was made International 
								Treasurer. He was not to fill the post for long, 
								dying in Chicago at the age of 75 on December 
								17, 1945. He was buried in Mount Hope Cemetery 
								in Blue Island, Illinois, where, thirteen months 
								later, Paul P. Harris was laid to rest next to 
								Schiele.<br><br>1. The History of Clay County,
