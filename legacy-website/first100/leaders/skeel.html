		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19"  width: 50%>Skeel, Ernst Laughlin 
		(1881-1952)<br><br>Ernst L. “Ernie” Skeel, a native of Cleveland, Ohio, 
		migrated to Seattle in 1907 and practiced law there for 44 years, but he 
		was better known for his wide-ranging business interests, his advocacy 
		of economic development, and his wide-ranging civic contributions. At 
		various times he headed the Municipal League of Seattle, the Seattle 
		Chamber of Commerce, the Commercial Club, the Seattle Rotary Club, and 
		in 1949 headed a committee formed to prevent the Boeing Airplane Co. 
		from transferring bomber production to its plant in Wichita, Kansas. The 
		Seattle-King County Association of Realtors named Ernst Skeel First 
		Citizen of 1948.<br>Midwestern Roots<br><br>Ernst Laughlin Skeel was 
		born on December 12, 1881, in Cleveland, Ohio, to Prentice M. and Clara 
		Laughlin Skeel. As a boy, he contributed to the family finances by 
		working variously as a newspaper boy, ice-wagon driver, and mill worker.<br>
		<br>Skeel was a 1903 graduate of Ohio Wesleyan University, where he 
		starred in baseball, basketball, football, and track. In football he was 
		a teammate of Branch Rickey (1881-1965), who became a legendary baseball 
		Hall of Famer, most notably for breaking baseball’s color barrier.<br>
		<br>He earned his law degree in 1906 at Western Reserve University 
		(later renamed Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland. He worked 
		his way through law school as a football coach at the College of 
		Wooster, a small liberal arts school in Wooster, Ohio. There he met 
		Hazel K. Emery, a student from the western Ohio farm town of Kenton who 
		was majoring in languages, and they married on December 30, 1908. Three 
		children would be born to them: Marguerite S., Willard E., and Dorothy 
		S. Hazel Skeel later said that “the most outstanding thing she did in 
		college was marry the football coach” (The Seattle Times). She herself, 
		however, would go on to an extremely active civic and social life in 
		Seattle -- with the Washington Athletic Club, Sunset Club, Women’s 
		University Club, Seattle Art Museum, and the Laurelhurst Orthopedic 
		Guild, among other groups.<br><br>Northwest Land of Opportunity<br><br>
		Skeel practiced law briefly in Ohio before migrating to Seattle in 1907, 
		where he associated himself with a series of partnerships, specializing 
		in business and administrative law. In one of his major victories, he 
		successfully defended Kilbourne &amp; Clark Mfg. Co., a pioneer Seattle 
		electrical manufacturing firm, in a series of radio transformer patent 
		infringement suits brought by the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co.<br><br>
		The nascent wireless radio industry was in high ferment after the turn 
		of the century, and competition was fierce, with much squabbling over 
		patents rights. Marconi first sued Kilbourne &amp; Clark in August 1915, but 
		the lawsuit expanded as it passed through lower courts, the U.S. Navy 
		became involved, and it morphed into a bigger suit. On June 21, 1943, 
		the U.S. Supreme Court finally ruled the Marconi patent claims invalid 
		(in Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. of America v. United States).<br><br>
		By this time Kilbourne &amp; Clark had long since -- back in 1925 -- gone 
		bankrupt. Skeel, the company’s counsel, “took as part of his payment all 
		the patents and patent rights held at that time” (R. Palmer). Although 
		he later sold the patent rights to R. Palmer, this was not an isolated 
		business venture for Skeel. At various times, he was an officer and/or 
		director of more than a dozen companies. He became president of Grays 
		Harbor Lines in 1936, and served as an officer of Puget Sound Bridge and 
		Dredging Co., Seattle Trust and Savings Bank, Lowman &amp; Hanford Co., 
		Olympic Steamship Co., Washington Title Insurance Co., and Olympia 
		Brewing Co., among others. Even so, early in his Seattle career, he 
		found time to maintain his sports connection by officiating at 
		intercollegiate games.<br><br>Trade Promoter<br><br>Skeel tirelessly 
		promoted development -- of Seattle, the suburbs, the Columbia River 
		Basin, and the Alaska trade. He was president of the Pacific Northwest 
		Trade Association and a director of the Institute of Pacific Relations 
		(IPR), a business-academic organization founded in the early 1930s. Also 
		involved with IPR were Dr. Raymond B. Allen (1902-1986), then president 
		of the University of Washington, and Seattle furrier Mike Dederer 
		(1905-1995), both Chamber of Commerce stalwarts and also recipients of 
		the First Citizen award. (The Institute of Pacific Relations became one 
		of the organizations investigated by a U.S. Senate committee for 
		possible Communist infiltration during the postwar Red Scare, ironically 
		so since several members held pro-McCarthy views.)<br><br>Skeel also was 
		active in Rotary. He was a founder of the Seattle club in 1909, helped 
		establish clubs elsewhere in the state and in Alaska, served as 
		president of the Seattle club in 1914, and finally as Northwest District 
		Governor. “Ernie Skeel was one of the early leaders in the district, and 
		much of the early Constitution and By-Laws of Rotary International was 
		written by him” (Rotary Global History).<br><br>Skeel’s civic bandwidth 
		was broad. He was president of the Municipal League of Seattle in 1931 
		and chairman of the Commercial Club in 1946. He headed the Seattle 
		Chamber of Commerce in 1947-1948, expanding its reach. That reach 
		expanded even further in 1949, when the U.S. Air Force was pressing 
		Boeing to transfer its bomber production to its plant in Wichita, 
		Kansas. The chamber formed a Save Boeing Committee, with Skeel as 
		chairman, which quickly grew into a wider community effort called the 
		Keep Boeing-Defend Seattle Committee. “The plan generated enormous 
		interest that stretched across class lines ... including organized labor 
		and the chamber of commerce” (Kirkendall). The successful drive also had 
		the support of the state’s congressional powers: Sen. Warren Magnuson 
		(1904-1989) and Reps. Henry M. Jackson (1912-1983) and Hugh Mitchell 
		(1907-1996).<br><br>Honored by the Community<br><br>The Seattle Chamber 
		of Commerce in 1952 created a new conference center, the Senior Council 
		Room, in Skeel’s honor, a move lauded in a Seattle Times editorial as “a 
		permanent memorial to one of the most active and inspiring leaders in 
		[the chamber’s] long history.”<br><br>Skeel was a zealous booster, no 
		question, and not afraid to speak his mind. He made that clear on 
		January 20, 1949, at the Seattle Real Estate Board (later Seattle-King 
		County Association of Realtors) ceremony honoring him as its First 
		Citizen for 1948. In his acceptance speech, he lauded the group “for the 
		reason that the 40-mil tax limit law sponsored by you has forced economy 
		in government and minimized waste.” The 40-mill limit on property taxes 
		in Washington state had been a divisive liberal-conservative issue since 
		1924.<br><br>Skeel urged the region to “support all industries; free our 
		waterfront of Harry Bridges … and strive for full development and sound 
		administration of the irrigation, reclamation and power resources of the 
		Columbia Valley” (Seattle Post-Intelligencer). Harry Bridges 
		(1901-1990), founder of the International Longshoremen’s and 
		Warehousemen’s Union, was one of the most powerful labor leaders on the 
		West Coast.<br><br>Skeel also was a member of the Rainier Club, Seattle 
		Golf and Country Club, Masons and Woodmen of the World. He died on April 
		14, 1952, after a long illness, at the age of 70. Hazel Emery Skeel died 
		on November 12, 1969, at the age of 84.<br><br>All pages of Rotary
