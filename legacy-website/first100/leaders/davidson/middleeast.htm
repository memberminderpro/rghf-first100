	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">This comes from the Rotarian for 
		November 1928. <br><br>The British as 
		a nation have always been addicted to clubs, as a page 'The Forerunners 
		of Rotary' testifies. They like to recreate their home world in whatever 
		country they might be. So wherever Colonial Officers, professionals and 
		businessmen found themselves in the Empire in the 20s and 30s, there was 
		a good chance of a Rotary Club being formed. Indeed, a letter in 1929 in 
		the Rotary Wheel, specifically invites English Rotarians to visit the 
		Bombay Club when in the city.<br><br>It was therefore appropriate that 
		Honorary Special Commissioner of Rotary International, James W. 
		Davidson, began his world tour on August 31st with a visit to London, 
		where he had interviews with the British Colonial Office, Foreign Office 
		and India Office. The Secretaries of State for these three departments 
		communicated with their representatives at places on the line of his 
		route, which the commissioner expected to find very useful. From London 
		he went to Holland and spoke at meetings in Amsterdam, Haarlem and the 
		Hague. While there he met the Dutch Secretary for the Colonies and was 
		given an introduction to the Governor General of Java, which he hoped 
		would lead to the successful launching of a Rotary Club in Batavia, a 
		part of what is now Djakarta.<br><br>From Holland, he travelled onto 
		Zurich before going on to Paris. There, with the help of local 
		Rotarians, he arranged contacts for Syria and Saigon. Jim Davidson next 
		took a train on the route of the Orient Express for Constantinople 
		(Istanbul).<br><br>In a report in the British Rotary magazine 'Rotary 
		Wheel' in August 1929, there is an account of Jim Davidson, the Special 
		Commissioner for Rotary Extension, arriving in Istanbul, Turkey in 1928. 
		Although some meetings were arranged and several officials expressed 
		interest, Davidson left Turkey with the feeling that it would take 
		perhaps years before conditions in Turkey were such that the 
		introduction of such a movement as Rotary could be successfully 
		accomplished. He was right. Istanbul was not chartered till 1955.<br>
		<br>Leaving Istanbul, Jim Davidson flew to Athens on November 18, 1928 
		and within less than a month had found enough business and professional 
		men to unite in organising a Rotary Club. This brought together men of 
		sharply divided political opinions, both Royalists and Republicans, 
		under the presidency of Spiro Loverdos, one of the leading bankers in 
		Athens. The charter membership was entirely Greek, unlike many of 
		Davidson's other clubs. The charter was presented and the club formally 
		received into Rotary on January 30, 1929.<br><br>EGYPT<br><br>During his 
		tour of the Middle East in 1928 and 1929, Jim Davidson first flew from 
		Greece to Egypt for a brief visit to Cairo where on December 29, 1928, 
		the Cairo Club was inaugurated. This new club in was due to be presented 
		with a Rotary flag as the first club in the country. For this special 
		occasion, the officers had an original idea. Its members chartered a 
		Nile steamer for the occasion. On the morning of March11, 1929, the 
		Rotarians and their guests embarked on the boat and steamed sedately up 
		the river. Luncheon was served afloat and was followed by the 
		presentation of the Charter and Flag, possibly the first and only time 
		this has been done on a boat. Some time after tea, the party returned to 
		Cairo. Thus, the Cairo Club was launched!!<br><br>Palestine<br><br>Jim 
		Davidson next went on to Palestine. Unlike some of the other Middle 
		Eastern countries such as Turkey and Egypt, the racial differences in 
		Palestine and the city of Jerusalem do not seem to have caused any 
		serious problems for establishing Rotary. The local people had a far 
		more international outlook which helped. Davidson found that there was 
		already in existence the nucleus of a Rotary Club brought together by 
		Rotarian Edward Wicher of San Anselmo, California, who at the time was 
		spending a year as a Professor in the American School of Archaeology in 
		Jerusalem.<br><br>Davidson and Wisher were able to bring together Jews, 
		Arabs, British and Turks into a club. Davidson said that the club gave 
		strong evidence of unity and hoped that its influence would spread to 
		other cities in Palestine . Although he left Jerusalem on February 9, 
		1929, the club was officially chartered on the same day as the Cairo 
		club, March 11, 1929.<br><br>ON TO INDIA<br><br>Davidson left Jerusalem 
		on February 9, travelling via Damascus in Arabia and Bagdad in Persia to 
		Bombay. However, he did not remain long enough in either country to 
		organise any Rotary Clubs. His first real stop over was in Bombay where 
		on March 19, he reported that he had succeeded in organising a Rotary 
		Club. He wrote that he &quot;had found business and professional men of the 
		highest type- some of them Indians but most of them British. A 
		sufficient number of British is an essential today for a successful 
		Rotary Club in India. Later on it may be possible to have Clubs composed 
		entirely of natives.&quot; After visiting other Indian cities, he set out for 
		Thayetmyo in Burma and Kuala Lumpur in the Federated Malay States.<br>
		<br>He did note that &quot;in both places there are groups of men who have, 
		during the past year, organised themselves as Rotary Clubs and applied 
		to the International Headquarters for recognition.&quot; Unfortunately not 
		all their activities and organisation met with official approval. It was 
		being left to Jim Davidson to sort out some inconsistencies. For example 
		Kuala Lumpur desired to have three members for each classification, one 
		Malay, one Chinese and one European.<br><br>BURMA<br><br>
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/countries/burma2/index.htm">The Rangoon 
		Club</a>, described by Davidson, as the second in Burma after 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/countries/burma1/index.htm">Thayetmo</a>, was 
		inaugurated in September 192 9. Thayetmo received its charter on 
		September 30, 1929. Rangoon started with 88 members. As Davidson pointed 
		out &quot;The reason for having so many charter members is that owing to the 
		peculiar conditions in Asia, with so many going away on home leave (to 
		Britain), it is important that clubs be started with as large a 
		membership as possible.&quot; Jim Davidson went on to observe that &quot;the 
		Rangoon Club is a true cross section of the community of officials, 
		business and professional men.&quot; Thus, the President was the Chairman of 
		the Government's Development Trust, the Secretary the Manager of the 
		Royal Insurance Company and the Vice President the Accountant General 
		for Burma.<br><br>All were British. The charter was dated November 
		27,1929.<br><br>
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/countries/burma1/index.htm">Thayetmo</a> The First Club in Burma<br><br>W.J.Barretto, 
		the Deputy British Commissioner, who had his headquarters in Thayetmyo, 
		had visited the Rotary Club of Cork in Ireland in late 1927 whiilst on 
		leave. He was so impressed that on his return to Burma, he organised a 
		Club bearing the name 'The Rotary Club of Thayetmyo' with the happy 
		motto &quot;Under Heaven, One Family'. This was in May 1928. Lacking 
		information about the correct procedures, this new club did not conform 
		with normal Rotary International practice. As a result, when they 
		applied to R.I. for acceptance into Rotary, it was deemed necessary to 
		postpone action until Jim Davidson could personally call upon them.<br>
		<br>In the summer of 1929, Jim Davidson spent three days in the city and 
		was pleased to find a successful club of 33 members. During his stay, he 
		found the members quite willing to make the necessary, and in some cases 
		rather radical changes in order that they might be officially 
		inaugurated. On July 17, 1929, the Thayetmyo Club was officially 
		inaugurated with W.J.Barretto as President, and 2 months later on 
		September 30, it received its charter, just beating the second club, in 
		Rangoon.<br><br>Because there was no suitable hotel or other meeting 
		place in Thayetmyo, the members had previously bought a suitable 
		building with grounds overlooking the Irrawaddy where it met for tea 
		every Saturday evening at 5, and for dinner once a month.<br><br>In 
		1929, there were only six Europeans resident in the city, so the greater 
		majority of the membership was Burmese. Davidson remarked that &quot;It will 
		be interesting to watch its progress. If it can succeed, there is a 
		prospect for further similar clubs in places that have a small European 
		community or even where there are no Europeans at all.&quot;<br><br>During 
		the occupation of the country in the Second World War, all Rotary 
		activity ceased and the Thayetmyo Club has never been re-opened.<br><br>
		THE FEDERATED MALAY STATES<br><br>Until 1948 the Federated Malay States 
		were a British Crown Colony, consisting of several states each with its 
		own constitution and ruler. Although we only record Seremban as the 
		first in what is now Malaysia, there were Rotary Clubs in most of the 
		states. Seremban Rotary Club is in the state of Negeri Semblan, a major 
		centre for the rubber plantations. Jim Davidson wrote that &quot;they had got 
		together 24 men all definitely interested. On the 19th (September 1929) 
		I met up with the Board, and after they had agreed to make certain 
		changes in classifications, meeting periods, etc., I was prepared to 
		hold an inauguration meeting at once on the occasion of a dinner 
		previously arranged. There were some 60 present, including several from 
		Kuala Lumpur.<br><br>The membership comprises five different 
		nationalities, including eleven British officials. As is the case in all 
		the cities in this area, with the exception of Singapore, the number of 
		suitable men in commerce and trade is few. The first President was 
		O.E.Venables but owing to his having been transferred to Grik, he had to 
		turn this office over to W.D.Barron. Owing to the difficulty of finding 
		a suitable place to meet, for the present the Club will meet twice a 
		month. It was chartered on December 4, 1929.<br><br>Jim Davidson had 
		previously visited Kuala Lumpur, having left Rangoon on the 5th for 
		Penang and travelled by rail to Kuala Lumpur. When he reached there, he 
		found an embryonic Rotary Club which had been meeting monthly for over a 
		year. This club had come into existence through the initiative of 
		L.D.Gammans who had visited Rotary clubs in England, the USA and Japan, 
		and saw the need for organization to develop and maintain good will 
		among the different racial groups, Chinese, Malays, Indians, Singalese 
		and the many Europeans connected with the Government. There were many in 
		mining, rubber, general commerce and trade. The club had been awaiting 
		Jim Davidson's arrival to obtain their charter. Now on September 
		27,1929, the club was officially inaugurated. This club interestingly 
		held regular lunch meetings with an evening dinner meeting once a month.<br>
		<br>In Perak, a club was started at Ipoh, the FMS's second largest city.<br>
		<br>Ipoh's organzation meeting was held on October 11, 1929, with 42 
		full members and His Highness the Sultan of Perak an Honorary Member.<br>
		<br>From north of the Malay Peninsula to the south, but not in 
		chronological order, Davidson was responsible for the creation of clubs 
		in Penang, Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur, Klang and Coast (now called Klang), 
		Seremban, Malacca and Singapore (now independent).<br><br>JAVA<br><br>
		After Singapore the Davidsons spent Christmas 1929 in Soerabaja (now 
		Surabaya). On Boxing Day they went on to Bali for a short holiday, 
		describing it as &quot;most unreal, the most unique and yet withal the most 
		fascinating place I have ever seen.&quot; He visited the two clubs on Java, 
		Soerabaja and Djogjakarta, both of which had been organised in August 
		1927. <br>Each had a membership of about 20, but Prince Pakoe Alam at 
		Djogjakarta was the only native member. At Soerabaja both the 
		Burgomaster and Governor were members. After a few days here the 
		Davidsons went onto Semarang.<br><br>When Davidson arrived in Batavia, 
		Java, to start work on January 29, 1930, he was fortunate ernough to 
		have with him introductory letters from the Foreign Office in London to 
		Sir Josiah Crosby the British Consul General, who, he learned, was 
		expecting him. Crosby took Davidson to see the Governor General who had 
		also been told by his Minister of the Colonies in The Hague to expect 
		him.<br><br>On March 18 in the Hotel des Indes, the inaugural meeting 
		was held with some 70 people present, 8 of whom were Javanese and 5 
		Chinese. A few members had previously been members of another Javanese 
		club in Surabaya. The following day the inaugural meeting of the 
		Bandoeng Club was held, The idea of holding these meetings on 
		consecutive days was to accommodate a visit by Guy Gundaker of 
		Philadelphia, President of RI in 1923/4. He arrived in Batavia early on 
		the 18th, spoke at the club there and then flew with Davidson to 
		Bandoeng's meeting on the 19th.<br><br>The energetic pair drove through 
		the night to a lunch meeting at the Djokjakarta Club and then a 6 hour 
		rail journey onto another lunch the next day at the Surabaya Club.... 4 
		days 4 Rotary lunches!<br><br>From Java, Jim Davidson reported that he 
		intended to return to Singapore and Penang.<br><br>Researched and
