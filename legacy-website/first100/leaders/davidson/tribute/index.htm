		At the fourth plenary session of the Rotary International 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/conventions/1934/index.htm">convention held at Detroit</a>, Mich., U. S. A., on June 28th, 1934, 
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/presidents/1915albert/index.htm">Allen 
		D. Albert</a>, President of Rotary International in 1915-1916, paid tribute 
		to the memory of Rotarian Jim Davidson, the Honorary General 
		Commissioner in Asia. The tribute was published in “Making New Friends”, 
		a book by Davidson’s widow, Lillian Dow Davidson, about the travels and 
		people found on Jim Davidson’s trek through the Middle East and Far East 
		for Rotary International. With him for the entire travel were his wife 
		and their young daughter, Marjory. Davidson’s objective was to establish 
		new Rotary clubs, and he spent US$250,000 of his own money on the 
		30-month trip, which produced more than twenty clubs from Athens to 
		Singapore.<br><br>

		Tribute To A Rotary Torch-Bearer<br><br>James W. Davidson–June 14, 
		1872–July 18, 1933<br><br>By Allen D. Albert, President of Rotary 
		International (1915-1916)<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style25" src="1915albert.jpg" style="float: left">Good movements among men would quickly 
		die if they were only calculations of good. We reason about them; we 
		seek to measure them and define them in terms of practical gain. Yet we 
		are not drawn to them by our logic. We respond to them as good movements 
		because we feel something that is divine within us answering to an 
		overtone that is divine.<br><br>Rotary is a movement of the love of men 
		for their fellows. Now love is not a thing to be reasoned about. It is 
		not to be expressed in formulas or equations. It cannot be put into the 
		terms of a contract. It is a giving. Rotary is a movement in which men 
		give of themselves for the help of mankind. That is what is meant by 
		service. When we say &quot;He profits most who serves best&quot; we mean that if 
		we men of the earth will but give of our best to each other, we shall 
		find ourselves in a world made better by our giving.<br><br>We must 
		live, to be sure. That is a way of saying we must earn our living. It is 
		the distinguishing mark of Rotary that it combines these two things—the 
		earning of our living and our giving to our fellows.<br><br>When a 
		lawyer becomes a Rotarian he engages that in pleading a case in court he 
		will give something of himself into the case and that he will not take a 
		case into which he cannot give himself. When the merchant Rotarian sells 
		something over a counter he pledges that he will give something of 
		himself along with the sale. When the physician Rotarian goes on his 
		calls, the engineer builds a viaduct, the Rotarian advertising writer 
		composes an advertisement, we look to them, first, that they shall do 
		honest work and, then, that they shall add something of themselves to 
		the honest work. The soul of Rotary is in this element of giving through 
		one's work.<br><br>To some it will seem a marvelous thing that a 
		movement, which has giving for its spirit should spread around the earth 
		in the lifetime of one man and convoke in a great industrial center an 
		assembly of thousands to counsel together how to give more and more. I 
		think it is no marvel. I recall that the patriot Garibaldi summoned the 
		youth of Italy not by holding out to them tempting promises of gain but 
		by calling them to sacrifice. He could not offer them loot, he said, or 
		brave uniforms, or the triumphant taking of cities; he could offer them 
		only hunger, probable defeat, and ignominy, death it might be, if not 
		from the cold then from the guns of a firing squad. What he had to offer 
		was the opportunity to give of themselves for the impalpable good of a 
		thing called the freedom of Italy. The young men of Italy who were most 
		like your sons and mine heard that call as to something within them 
		which was divine.<br><br>No wonder, then, that Rotary should gather to 
		itself generous men. It is a very co-partnership of the generous. What 
		one of us has come here but to learn to give, to find the better way of 
		giving through his work, to refresh his consecrations, to speak of 
		giving, from such a rostrum, to his brothers of every calling? It is out 
		of such councils as this that we have recruited the leaders of Rotary.<br>
		<br>Let no one assume to list those leaders in any order, to say that 
		such a one was great and such another one greater. He will find himself 
		confounded like the nobleman in the legend who would erect a great 
		temple – do you remember? – which should be his tribute to God and his 
		only. He would pay for every stone, for every blow of the mason's 
		mallet, for every bit of colored glass. When the cathedral was finished 
		God exhibited to him in a vision a long procession of givers to it and 
		the chief among them was a peasant woman who gave wisps of hay to the 
		horses that dragged the sleds of stone up the hill in front of her 
		cottage.<br><br>We turn our thought today to one of whom it is 
		warrantable to say that he spent his richest years in giving unto Rotary 
		and through Rotary in giving unto mankind. He would be uncomfortable to 
		hear himself spoken of as more than one in a fellowship of those who 
		gave what they could. Of their own merits modest men are dumb. Yet we 
		set aside this moment in the lives of the thousands of us who are 
		gathered at this Detroit Convention because we are conscious that he 
		gave and gave abundantly and we would make such an acknowledgment of his 
		giving that all the world might know.<br><br>[At this moment a large 
		photograph of Rotarian Davidson was illuminated on the platform and 
		remained so until the memorial address was concluded.]<br><br>
		<a href="davidson-profile.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style26" height="400" src="davidson-profile.jpg" style="float: left" width="264"></a>He was 
		Rotarian James Wheeler Davidson of the Club of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. 
		The God who has set labor and rest as day and night to men successive 
		called this one of his sons unto Himself on an evening in July of last 
		year. Davidson had lived fully and that death which is the brother of 
		sleep came to him after a career of useful business and professional 
		life, of travel and adventure such as few men have ever experienced, of 
		giving himself in measures too deep for any but great hearts to fill.<br>
		<br>This was a man who went with Peary to the arctic. Who was a war 
		correspondent attached first to a Chinese and then to a Japanese army. 
		Who became a consul of the United States in Formosa and wrote there a 
		work on that island which is still widely read and used. Who served for 
		a time as United States Consul General in the largest of the consular 
		stations of his country, that at Shanghai.<br><br>Had his life ended 
		with that service in 1903, the man Davidson would have been written down 
		a success. But in 1906 he opened another chapter. He went to Calgary and 
		after a time became a Canadian citizen.<br><br>When Rotary was disclosed 
		to him there in 1914 its message of giving went straightway to his heart 
		and the new chapter of his life became one of a journeying forth to 
		carry the ideals of Rotary from Calgary to the far places of the earth.<br>
		<br>With Colonel James Layton Ralston of
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/clubs/cities/clubs/81halifax.htm">
		Halifax</a>, Nova Scotia, he undertook the extension of Rotary to the 
		British Dominions of Australia and New Zealand. That work done, he 
		served as governor of Rotary's District Number 4 and in succession was a 
		member of the extension committee of Rotary International, director, 
		third vice-president and chairman of the committee on international 
		service.<br><br>His business enterprise and wide travels had accustomed 
		Davidson to think and plan broadly. In August, in 1928, he and his wife 
		and their daughter Marjory set off to fill the gap in the Rotary girdle 
		which then extended from the Caspian Sea to the China Sea. He had 
		expected to spend about eight months on the mission. Instead he spent 
		more than thirty months.<br><br><a href="ralston.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style26" height="356" src="ralston.jpg" style="float: left" width="264"></a><a href="ralston.jpg" name="Layton" target="_blank">More</a> 
		than a score of Rotary clubs represented in this convention from the 
		Orient are the fruit of his energy and enthusiasm. In certain cities the 
		problem was to induct into Rotary self-organized clubs. In others he 
		persuaded high government officers, even the brother of a king, to 
		participate actively in the organization of clubs. Here the obstruction 
		was a rigid demarcation of society by lines of caste. Here it was the 
		aloofness of the men best able to comprehend and fulfill an ideal of 
		giving for the good of mankind.<br><br>Adventure is to the adventurous. 
		The Davidsons underwent hardships that might well have daunted even a 
		Peary. On a road in the Malay jungle their automobile was upset into a 
		ditch of water from which natives rescued them and afterwards ministered 
		unto them in thatched huts. Davidson had several fevers. His daughter 
		was dangerously poisoned by insect bite.<br><br>Every traveler knows how 
		the next land beckons, and since the next land meant Rotary to the 
		Davidsons their stay in the East lengthened on and on, despite the 
		mishaps, the perils and the calls of business and home.<br><br>Is there 
		Rotary in the ancient city of Athens? Davidson took it there. In 
		Jerusalem, Cairo, Bombay, Delhi, Madras, Colombo, Rangoon, Thayetmyo, 
		the Federated Malay States, Java, Sumatra, the Straits Settlements and 
		Siam? Davidson planted it. The conditions were new. If clubs were to be 
		stable they must be nurtured through the years. That work, the Rotary 
		Commissioner perforce left to residents. The long endeavor to foster a 
		better understanding among national, racial and religious groups, with 
		various interests, and mutually aloof, of necessity must rest with their 
		own leaders and with us of Rotary elsewhere in the world who may have 
		the opportunity to support and fortify those leaders.<br><br>The Rotary 
		argosy was no mere putting into coves and sailing away. A member of the 
		faculty of the University of Melbourne has written us this 
		acknowledgment: &quot;Thirteen years have passed since Davidson and Ralston 
		founded in Melbourne the first Antipodean Rotary Club. Time in its 
		course is taking from us one by one those who were privileged to enter 
		into the circle of Davidson's friendship and to come under the spell of 
		his enthusiasm, but the movement he started goes on in ever increasing 
		volume, range and energy, and his dynamic personality survives in what 
		the future will reverence as a fitting memorial to a man guided by a 
		great ideal.&quot;<br><br>The fairly familiar phrase &quot;his dynamic 
		personality&quot; does not wholly describe Jim Davidson. Everything about him 
		was big—body, head, brain, voice, laugh, straight look of the eyes, 
		heart, purpose, ideal, love of Rotary. His business was big—he became an 
		extensive owner of real estate in Canada. His faith was vast. He and 
		Mrs. Davidson and Marjory strengthened the ties of rich family devotion 
		by winding them about with common experiences around the world, by 
		travel, the great test of companionship, by steamers on ocean and river, 
		by rail, automobile and aeroplane, by pushcar, camel and elephant. These 
		conveyances bore the man Davidson to more than two thousand other men in 
		their offices and counting-rooms. Wherever they took him he was a 
		torch-bearer, shedding the light of sympathetic understanding upon 
		peoples of the earth newly entered into the fellowship of Rotary.<br>
		<br>We who are the brothers in Rotary to Jim Davidson think of him in 
		this memorial hour not as one who has gone from us so much as one who 
		remains with us through that which he gave along with his work. In an 
		international assembly of Rotarians we have consciousness of his 
		presence. We know that the two who knew him best and loved him most have 
		the same consciousness and we would that our gratitude might strengthen 
		it.<br><br>The soft wings of peace now cover him round. But the thing 
		that is divine in us is not confined by our death. Wherever there has 
		been glowing generosity, radiant sympathy, a giving of self through work 
		in our little companies of the Rotary brotherhood, those qualities shine 
		on and on when we are gone as the stars shine in the Canadian night.<br>
		<br>Col. J. Layton Ralston, King's Counsel, D.S.O., C.M.G., D.C.L., C.C 
		S., was appointed Minister of Defense in the Canadian Government in 
		1926. He was a well-known lawyer of Halifax, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 
		Canada, and in 1921 was one of the two Special Commissioners of Rotary, 
		along with Jim Davidson, who organized the first Rotary clubs in 
		Australia and New Zealand. The picture appeared on page 30 of the 
		November 1926 issue of The Rotarian.</td>
