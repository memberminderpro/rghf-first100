		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19"  width: 50%>Mrs Davidson’s 1934 book was produced 
		by Rotary International as a tribute to Jim Davidson who passed away a 
		year earlier.<br><br>Lillian Davidson has sent her writings back to 
		Rotary International headquarters as they family progressed throughout 
		the near and far east. Much of the book would appear in “The Rotarian” 
		magazine. The trip which began in August 1928 lasted almost three years 
		and measured about 10,000 miles in distance travelled (and cost Davidson 
		a rumoured $250,000)– such was the dedication of Jim Davidson and his 
		family.<br><br>Paul Harris himself was delighted to write an 
		introduction to the book (full text appears below) where he would 
		describe Davidson’s trip as “a journey that was to remake the map of 
		Rotary.”<br><br>The book clearly and extensively describes the new 
		cultures that the Davidsons experienced.<br><br>Lillian first met Jim in 
		Shanghai when he was American Consulate-General, a role he enjoyed and 
		an experience that would serve him well in his Rotary mission.<br><br>In 
		Turkey, Jim managed to secure the assistance of Government officials 
		–especially the Prefect of Police of Constantinople, Sherif Bey- in 
		order to sell the new, ‘western’ idea of Rotary to the Turks. Davidson 
		himself had serious doubts as to whether Turkish Rotary would flourish. 
		He said: “I felt that in few of the many countries that I would visit, 
		could Rotary perform so great a service as in Turkey, for the Turks 
		need a friendly world association which they do not now possess”.<br>
		<br>In Athens, Greece, Davidson had testimonials from three US 
		Presidents and British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. He gained the 
		support of the Greek PM Venizelos who agreed with Davidson that Rotary 
		could only succeed if it united those with differing political views. In 
		Athens, there were clear differences between the Royalists and 
		Republicans.<br><br>As the Davidsons continued on to Egypt, the good 
		work of London Rotarians became apparent in setting up the Cairo club. 
		Stanley Leverton had encouraged W R Todd of Thomas Cook &amp; Son (Cairo) in 
		keeping a survey of potential Rotarians. Previous attempts in organizing 
		a club – Sam Gluckstein of Hammersmith Rotary Club had attempted this 
		task in 1927- had failed. The first meeting of the Cairo club on May 2nd 
		1928 only saw 5 present and by November 16 men of 8 different 
		nationalities were attending meetings. Jim Davidson attended a December 
		meeting before overseeing the official organization meeting on January 
		2nd 1929 with R Clare Martin of the Shell Oil Company the first 
		President.<br><br>

		most tense areas from Palestine to Iraq. Lillian Davidson kept notes on 
		her experiences which are worthy of description in themselves (though 
		lack of space precludes this).<br><br>In India, Davidson helped found 
		the Bombay club in March 1929 though Rotary in India was born in 1920 
		with the formation of the Calcutta club. Davidson was also successful in 
		setting up a Rotary Club in Ceylon.<br><br>Travelling on to Burma, he 
		helped establish the Rangoon club on September 2nd 1929 where the 
		charter was presented by the Governor of Burma Sir Charles Innes.<br>

		Rotary. L D Gammans had saw a Rotary Club in action in Detroit in 1918

		Asian cities (with their Imperial ties to older European nations), 
		Singapore was a cosmopolitan mix of nationalities. Rotary in Singapore 
		had many different nations represented – from Americans to Armenians, 
		from Japanese to Indians, from Italian to Irish.<br><br>In the Dutch 
		East Indies Davidson met up with Past RI President Guy Gundaker in Java. 
		Both men witnessed the organization meeting of the Batavia club on March 
		18th 1930.<br><br>

		rumoured to exist. Chesley Perry had failed to corroborate this. In

		the help of Atkinson and, of course, Jim Davidson.<br><br>Davidson was 
		meticulous in his planning. In French Indo-China Davidson was able to 
		present letters of introduction he had obtained while in Paris to the 
		French Governor General in Hanoi and the French Governor at Saigon. He 
		had been only too aware of the attempts by Marseilles Rotarians in 
		setting up a club in Saigon.<br><br>Davidson would also visit Hong Kong 
		and there he would find it relatively simple to introduce Rotary. The 
		city was made for Rotary as 80 were present on December 8th 1930 as the 
		club was organized. This would be Davidson’s last city in his programme 
		of extension. He would continue to travel to Shanghai and throughout 
		China, the Philippines, Korea and Japan.<br><br>

		<td valign="top" class="auto-style10"  width: 50%>INTRODUCTION<br><br>By PAUL P. HARRIS<br>Founder of the first Rotary 
		Club<br>and President Emeritus of Rotary International<br><br>August 23, 
		1928, the &quot;Duchess of Athol&quot; sailed from Montreal. On board were James 
		W. Davidson, Honorary General Commissioner of Rotary International, his 
		wife, Lillian Dow Davidson, and Marjory, their daughter. The Davidsons 
		were starting on a mission for Rotary International that was to take 
		them away from their home for nearly three years—a journey that was to 
		remake the map of Rotary.<br><br>It was a new manner of pioneering for 
		Rotary, an experiment in organiza­tion work involving several 
		fundamental questions. Jim was confronted with the problem of &quot;selling&quot; 
		to businessmen of the Orient a brand new idea, which in a few brief 
		years, had gained great headway in the Western world. Would this Rotary, 
		born in a city of the central western prairies of the United States, be 
		acceptable to peoples with racial customs <br>and backgrounds differing from 
		those of Occidental peoples?<br><br>History was to be made. Appreciating 
		the significance of the mission, Com­missioner Davidson was invited to 
		contribute a series of articles to &quot;The Rotarian&quot; setting forth his 
		experiences. Jim declined on the ground that his organization work would 
		demand his entire time. However, he suggested that Mrs. Davidson might 
		be willing to write a series of articles describing their travels and 
		experi­ences; having access to Jim's reports, <br>she could quote 
		extensively from them.<br><br>The suggestion was immediately accepted by 
		&quot;The Rotarian,&quot; and from the first it proved to be a labour of love for 
		Lillian Davidson. With the exception of the last few instalments, each 
		manuscript was sent from wherever her husband happened to be stationed 
		at the time. The first article appeared in the February, 1930, issue and 
		they appeared thereafter monthly, with few interruptions, until January, 
		1933. The publication of the series proved to be an event of outstanding 
		importance. They commanded wide attention from the first and were 
		reprinted in general magazines as well as other Rotary publications. 
		They were translated into several languages.<br><br>The decision to 
		publish them in one volume is both timely and wise. A series of 
		documents so intensely human should be a matter of permanent record. 
		Jim, Lillian and Marjory visited more than a score of countries. Jim was 
		Rotary's ambassador plenipotentiary, official messenger of goodwill. The 
		Rotarian trav­eller may today as a result of Jim's efforts take any of 
		the important steamers ply­ing between London <br>and Tokyo and find a 
		Rotary club at nearly every port. <br><br>Tens of thousands of miles were 
		covered by the Davidsons and more than two thou­sand business and 
		professional men were interviewed by Jim in their places of business, 
		the principles and practices of Rotary explained, and the prospects of 
		organizing a Rotary club locally discussed. The use of the services of 
		an inter­preter was frequently necessary.<br><br>There were 
		disappointments and hardships, to be sure, but, on the other hand, there 
		were experiences and adventures in friendship which far outweighed 
		tem­porary discouragements. Jim Davidson's unfailing diplomacy, his 
		enthusiasm for Rotary, and his remarkable capacity for work, carried him 
		over many seemingly insurmountable barriers.<br><br>Someone has said 
		that &quot;Books Are Men.&quot; Truly this volume, &quot;Making New Friends,&quot; 
		represents not only three years in the lives of the Davidson family, but 
		reflected on its pages, is a lifetime of adventure and journalistic 
		experience. Both Jim and Lillian Davidson were keen observers. They 
		missed very little of impor­tance. They peered beneath surface 
		conditions. Their stay in certain countries —notably Turkey—was 
		coincident with vast political and social changes. They wrote (and I am 
		including Jim, as his Rotary reports account for a considerable portion 
		of this volume) <br>with understanding eyes, and hearts full of sympathy for 
		the misfortunes of others.<br><br>Their book comprises an interesting and 
		authorita­tive study of the peoples of the Near and Far East. <br>Through 
		their narrative runs a Rotary thread that gives color to the fabric.<br>
		<br>&quot;The great lesson,&quot; Jim wrote, &quot;to be drawn from mingling with the 
		edu­cated native peoples of all these countries is that in each race or 
		nationality one finds many things to admire, virtues that perhaps we are 
		lacking; and their defects, after all, are not more striking than our 
		own. They are apparent to us because they are different.&quot; Friendly 
		travelers to the Orient will appreciate this concluding observation: &quot;If 
		the Asiatic looks strange and eccentric to us, you may rest assured that 
		we appear the same to him. If he irritates us, we irritate him, only he 
		is generally too courteous to show it. We, of the West, in our 
		inter-racial contacts, are often lacking in the good manners which 
		characterize Asiatics.&quot;<br><br>That paragraph could well be made the 
		text of the International Service Committee of every Rotary club 
		interested in promoting friendship and under­standing beyond its own 
		national frontiers. Nations aspire to become the biggest and strongest 
		of all nations. A spiritual pauperism exists in the midst of much 
		material wealth. There is too much &quot;Take&quot; in the world, and not enough 
		&quot;Give.&quot; <br>This is reflected in business contacts and also in international 
		diplomacy.<br><br>Jim Davidson, in organizing new Rotary clubs, was 
		engaged in the noble work of making new friends. His string of clubs 
		across <br>the face of Asia will prove to be an effective agency for 
		goodwill and understanding.<br><br>No one who reads this book can fail 
		to gain a better conception of Eastern peoples and governments. <br>Even if 
		it had no other purpose, in that alone, it would be well worth while.<br>
