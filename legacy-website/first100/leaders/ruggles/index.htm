		Look around your Rotary club and think about what Harry Ruggles started.<br>
		<br>Being the &quot;printer&quot; he created the first printed emblem. Since they 
		called themselves &quot;Rotary,&quot; Harry used a wagon wheel with &quot;Rotary Club&quot; 
		above it.<br><br>But Harry Ruggles' single great contribution had 
		nothing to do with his trade. Here is what really happened when &quot;Rotary 
		started to sing!&quot;<br><br>Then, in 2002, Doug Rudman of the Rotary Global 
		History research team with sources including Sue Davis, granddaughter of 
		Harry Ruggles, the diaries of PRID Joe Calder, 1928-29 (via PRIP Wilf 
		Wilkerson), &quot;The ABCs of Rotary,&quot; PRIP Cliff Dochterman 1992-93 and Oren 
		Arnold's &quot;The Golden Strand,&quot; 1966, copyright ROTARY/One, page 97, 
		prepared the following article.<br><br>An article, published in a 1978 
		Rotarian Magazine and Paul Harris' own comments from his story/textbook 
		of Rotary &quot;This Rotarian Age&quot; follow this article.<br><br>From &quot;The 
		Golden Strand,&quot; Rotary Club of Chicago's look at the first 61 years of 
		their club, this much is certain: Harry Ruggles was at the second 
		meeting of Rotary and Paul Harris had suggested him as the &quot;printer&quot; for 
		the new organization. The sixth meeting took place at Harry's printing 
		shop.<br><br>Ruggles was one of only two people Harris says he discussed 
		his idea with from 1900 to 1905.<br><br>

		Sue Davis-Hornby</a>, Denver, USA (Rotarian and RGHF member)<br><br>How 
		Singing came to Rotary, and Off-Color Jokes did not! Almost everyone who 
		is a member of a Rotary club for more than a year knows that Rotary 
		member No. 5, Chicago printer Harry Ruggles, brought singing to Rotary 
		meetings. What almost no one knows is why, and most don't know how 
		important it was to<br>the life of Rotary.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style20" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/ruggles/images/ruggles.jpg" style="float: left">Harry 
		Ruggles was a very moral man. He detested off-color language, malicious 
		innuendo and classless humor. He argued in club meetings for clean 
		language. Little more than a year after Rotary had been formed, at an 
		evening meeting in 1906, the guest speaker began a story. Having heard 
		it before, Harry also had heard the off-color ending, and felt it was 
		inappropriate for the club, so he jumped up in the middle of the joke 
		and yelled, &quot;Come on boys, let's sing!&quot; He then led the club in the 
		singing of &quot;Let Me Call You Sweetheart.&quot;<br><br><br>This was not only the 
		first time that members had ever sung in Rotary, but apparently, also 
		the first time that a group of businessmen ever sang at a business 
		meeting, anywhere. By his surprising actions at this evening meeting, 
		Harry demonstrated that demeaning activities and off-color stories were 
		not welcome at Rotary gatherings. &quot;It was reported at the time that the 
		would-be speaker was embarrassed and sore,&quot; and so Harry Ruggles 
		apologized, but the club backed him up. Right then and there, it was 
		decided that all subsequent Rotary meetings should be conducted so that 
		any woman could attend without being embarrassed. This has been the 
		unwritten rule ever since, just as the tradition of singing has endured.<br>
		<br>Dirty words were not the only controversy in the early days of 
		Rotary. Oren Arnold, in The Golden Strand, revealed, &quot;The time came, 
		repeatedly, when Paul Harris was faced with failure; for one reason or 
		another -- or for no real reason -- the club often was at the point of 
		disbanding. On such critical occasions Harry stepped up front and 
		shouted, 'Come on, fellows, let's sing!'<br><br>Was it the magic of 
		Harry Ruggles and his music that worked? Was it his infectious 
		enthusiasm for singing? Or, just maybe, some of the reasons for its use 
		had more to do with easing barriers between men, and ending acrimonious 
		discussions than a need for choral music.<br><br>History has proven that 
		it was, and is, good magic for clubs anywhere, for families anywhere, 
		for groups of people anywhere. Arnold continues, &quot;After all, clubs are 
		simply families; when they move in divergent paths, group singing often 
		is the best way to reassemble them. Harry Ruggles knew that, hence the 
		parent unit and the whole service club movement is indebted to him.&quot; <br>
