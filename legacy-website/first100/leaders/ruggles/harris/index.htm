		<img class="auto-style27" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/ruggles/harris/images/phrug1pic031952_small.jpg" style="float: left"></a>I 
		never knew a fellow like Paul Harris. Of all the men I ever met, I 
		couldn't choose one better fitted to be the Founder of Rotary.<br><br>
		Why? Well, there's no simple answer to that question because Paul had as 
		many sides as a centipede has feet. Speakers will tell you he was a man 
		of noble ideals, a profound thinker, and a leader gifted with 
		imagination. I agree. But as I think back over our many years as 
		friends, I can say truthfully I have known no one to get more fun out of 
		just being human. If there's a secret to Paul's success, it's that he 
		just naturally liked people.<br><br>Physically, he wasn't a big fellow, 
		certainly not the halfback type at all, though he played razzle&#8209;dazzle 
		football in his prep-school days. When he hung out his shingle as a 
		lawyer in Chicago, back in 1896, he was a handsome chap. Most Rotarians 
		are familiar with his picture as a serious, baldheaded, middle&#8209;aged man. 
		But you should have seen him when he had a full head of dark hair and a 
		mustache. In those days he could swing as dapper a cane and wear as 
		smart a derby on Sunday walks along Lake Michigan as any young bachelor 
		in Chicago.<br><br>Wherever he went, he would stop and talk to folks. It 
		didn't make any difference who. He always seemed restless to meet more 
		people and to know how they lived. Though born in Racine, Wisconsin, in 
		1868, he was raised by his father's parents in quiet New England at 
		Wallingford, Vermont. Most boys are satisfied to complete their college 
		career at one school. Not restless Paul. He spent a year at the 
		University of Vermont, another at Princeton University, and finished up 
		in law at the University of Iowa.<br><br>Then while most of his 
		classmates were settling down, Paul did a characteristic thing. He 
		earmarked the next five years of his life to see the world. Yellowstone 
		Park called. Then San Francisco, where he worked on a newspaper and a 
		fruit farm. He taught in a Los Angeles business college; &quot;punched cows&quot; 
		near Platteville, Colorado; clerked in a hotel in Jacksonville, Florida, 
		and became a salesman there for Vermont granite. Before his five years 
		were up, he had worked his way to England on a cattle boat and bicycled 
		all over the Continent.<br><br>His five&#8209;year &quot;apprenticeship to living&quot; 
		being over, he settled in Chicago, a young lawyer very much in need of 
		paying clients. It was business that brought Paul and me together, as I 
		have already noted, and was the magnet that drew the early members into 
		our Rotary Club. Yet with the profit appeal went fellowship, and under 
		Paul's leadership the emphasis became less and less “selfish” and more 
		and more on fellowship with idealistic goals that naturally suggested 
		themselves.<br><br>Silvester Schiele, the coal dealer, was Paul's first 
		convert to his idea for a new club. Official Rotary Global History says 
		that they had dinner, then met with Gus Loehr a mining engineer, and his 
		friend Hiram Shorey, a tailor, at Gus' office on February 23, 1905. I 
		was at the next session, becoming the fifth Rotarian.<br><br>Gus and 
		Hiram dropped out within a short time. But what these two lacked in 
		enthusiasm was made up by others, for example Will R. (&quot;Doc&quot;) Neff, a 
		dentist, and later &quot;Pete&quot; Powers, who had been on the stage and livened 
		our meetings with fun. When interest sagged so low in 1906 that we 
		considered disbanding, a handful of us kept the Club alive. Doc slaved 
		for Rotary more than 15 years, day and night, as Financial Secretary. 
		Never got a nickel for it. Pete was a good running mate. If either 
		promised to do something, it was as good as done.<br><br>LET me also pin 
		a rose on two other old&#8209;timers, Charlie Newton and A. M. (&quot;Red&quot;) Ramsay. 
		&quot;Red” is gone, but Charlie lives in Los Angeles, where he still carries 
		on in insurance and keeps up the finest private collection of old Rotary 
		documents in existence. We used to call him &quot;watchdog of the 
		Constitution&quot; because he was, and is, a great arguer.<br><br>As for my 
		own part in early days of No. 1, I concentrated on the practical problem 
		of getting new members. Paul Harris was a good writer and put out bales 
		of pamphlets and letters, leaving recruiting largely to me. I liked this 
		because I always was a mixer and felt that out of our 1,000 or so 
		print&#8209;shop customers, quite a few would be glad to join. They were. Once 
		I had a list of 150 members I recruited. But success went to our heads, 
		I'm afraid.<br><br>Have you ever heard of Rotary &quot;Yellow Dogs&quot;? I sort 
		of hope not&#8209;yet because they taught us a lesson. I'll tell the story. Up 
		to 1909 our membership ran about 190. Then we, and I guess I was one of 
		the pushers, thought we should have a lot more. So I printed a circular 
		listing &quot;open classifications” saying we expected every Rotarian to do 
		his duty by bringing in at least one new member. Those who didn't had to 
		wear outlandish paper hats, sit at an old board table, and with tin 
		spoons eat soup and hash from tin dishes. They were Yellow Dogs. The 
		rest of us feasted like kings at the other end of the room.<br><br>I 
		don't recommend the Yellow Dog idea for any Club! It brought in new 
		members, of course, but before long it was plain as Jimmy Durante's nose 
		that we had made a mistake. We had gone after quantity when we should 
		have concentrated on quality.<br><br>
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/ruggles/harris/images/ches.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="203" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/ruggles/harris/images/ches_small.jpg" style="float: left" width="287"></a>Yet, 
		if I may speak up for myself, I'll say my record wasn't too bad, because 
		I brought Chesley R. Perry into Rotary. That was in 1908. Ches was a 
		veteran of the Spanish&#8209; American War, had had newspaper experience, was 
		interested in investments in Mexico and worked in the Chicago Public 
		Library. His tremendous vitality and organizing ability were poured into 
		Rotary in 1910 when Paul Harris persuaded him to be Secretary of what 
		was to become Rotary International. Ches slaved on that job till 1942, 
		32 fruitful years. In “My Road to Rotary” Paul says, &quot;If I can in truth 
		be called the architect, Ches can with equal truth be called the builder 
		of Rotary International.”<br><br>Back in 1909, Ches had a part in an 
		event which, though unfortunate at the time, taught our young Club a 
		lesson. Someone got the idea that we should have hot election rivalry, 
		so the Club was a divided arbitrarily into two groups, &quot;Reds&quot; and 
		&quot;Blues.&quot; Ches headed up one ticket and &quot;Red” Ramsey the other. &quot;Red&quot; 
		won, but though Ches was a good sport so about it we realized that hard 
		feelings had developed among certain members and that hot fights in Club 
		elections didn't promote the Club's health.<br><br>But back again, to the early 
		days. Paul would often give me a ring, and we'd meet in a winestube on 
		Dearborn Street and talk by the hour about ways to get new members, 
		about programs, and so on. Often he came to suburban Hinsdale, spending 
		the week&#8209;end with Josephine and me. Sometimes he became discouraged 
		about Rotary, but usually wasn't.<br><br>PAUL seemed the logical on to 
		be first President, but he insisted that Silvester Schiele have the 
		honor. Silvester was followed by A. L. White, but by 1907 Paul couldn't 
		hold out longer against pressure and accepted the position, and again in 
		1908. But already he had a bee in his bonnet that Rotary could become a 
		national, perhaps international organization. When he resigned the 
		Presidency in October, 1908 he poured his enthusiasm into extension.<br>
		<br>Our second Club was started in 1908 in San Francisco while I was 
		President of No. 1. Oakland followed soon, then Seattle, Los Angeles, 
		and New York. An incident connected with starting in New York throws 
		such light on Paul Harris' zeal that perhaps I should mention it.<br>
		<br>Paul had persuaded Fred Tweed to get things going there and thought 
		Fred should be paid his out&#8209;of&#8209;pocket expenses. Knowing the close race 
		between our income and our expenses&#8209;dues were but $12 a year! I insisted 
		that the Club decide. In fact, I was a bit wary about taking on more 
		extension than we could chew, as this, the fifth plank in my 
		Presidential platform, shows:<br>&quot;While I believe it would be ideal to 
		have a Rotary Club in every large city and have a national organization 
		with headquarters in Chicago, still I believe that we should go about 
		this with caution. This matter should be discussed in all its phases at 
		a meeting of the Directors. I do not want to take the responsibility of 
		this work and a Committee will have to take it and submit a plan for the 
		Club's consideration.&quot;<br>[the committee included Ches Perry, and a 
		comment in &quot;My Road to Rotary&quot; by Harris expands on this slightly tense 
		time]<br><br>Fortunately, Paul Harris' enthusiasm carried the day and 
		Fred Tweed was reimbursed. If I was lukewarm at first about new Clubs, I 
		soon became hot doing what I could by song leading to help make the 
		first Convention a success. It was held in Chicago in 1910 and resulted 
		in the organization of the National Association of Rotary Clubs in 
		America. That's the year ten of us Chicago Rotarians paid our own way to 
		Minnesota to launch Clubs in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Then in 1912&#8209;13 
		as one of President Glenn C. Mead's Directors, with the help of Chesley 
		Perry, we got Clubs organized in Peoria, Illinois, and Indianapolis, 
		Indiana. Today nobody in the wide, wide world is prouder of the way 
		Rotary has grown than Harry Ruggles.<br><br>Maybe up to now I've given 
		you the idea we early Rotarians were too serious. In a way we were, but 
		in most ways we weren't. And when there was fun to be had, Paul was 
		usually the ring leader. He would keep a poker face, until the right 
		time, then laugh until his whole body would shake.<br><br>
		<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/ruggles/harris/images/outing.jpg" target="_blank">
		<img class="auto-style27" height="98" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/ruggles/harris/images/outing_small.jpg" style="float: left" width="269"></a>He 
		was a great fellow to promote a week&#8209;end picnic. Often it was across 
		Lake Michigan at Paw Paw Lake or Dowagiac, where his bachelor friend Tom 
		Clybourn had an ideal, well&#8209;stocked place for letdowns. We would fish or 
		swim, paddle a canoe or play baseball .. well, do about everything. Each 
		would kick in $10 to &quot;Doc&quot; Neff for a &quot;kitty&quot; &#8209;but expenses were light, 
		so &quot;Doc&quot; usually would declare a Monday &quot;dividend.&quot;<br><br>Once Paul led 
		the bunch on a weekend hike in the sand&#8209;dune country along the south end 
		of Lake Michigan. Just where I don't remember, but I know that after a 
		long, long hike some of us wanted to turn back.<br><br>&quot;All right,&quot; said 
		sober&#8209;sided Paul, “we'll walk back to the station and catch the 
		interurban to Chicago.&quot;<br><br>He led the way. We walked and we walked 
		and the sun was beating down. We were sweaty and plenty tired when a 
		farmhouse dame into view. When one of our fellows - we called him 
		&quot;Dipper&quot; Smith ever afterward&#8209;saw the well, he galloped up like a horse 
		and drank two quart dipperfuls of water.<br><br>&quot;Got any beer?&quot; he asked 
		the farmer's wife.<br><br>&quot;Come on in and we'll see,&quot; she said. As she 
		opened the door, there was a table spread for us, groaning with every 
		sort of food a farmer's wife could lay out. Of course, Paul had arranged 
		it all. And did he chuckle!<br><br>That night We slept in the barn. Next 
		morning Paul suggested that he and I go to church. It was a Swedish 
		church, but that made no difference to Paul. He enjoyed every minute of 
		it, especially when he and I in our loudest voices joined in singing 
		Swedish hymns of which we understood not a word.<br><br>In our earliest 
		days we didn't have regular programs, remember. Partly for fun, partly 
		to startle new members into realizing they really were joining 
		something, we initiated them. Often we'd tell the newcomer to sing, say, 
		Auld Lang Syne or, maybe, give a speech on the future of the horseless 
		carriage. He'd hardly have his mouth open before a hook from the wings 
		would yank him offstage to the accompaniment of catcalls. Pete Powers 
		generally arranged such events and sometimes would have the neophyte 
		wear his coat inside out, then crawl beneath outspread legs of members, 
		with, of course, a few well&#8209;placed pats.<br><br>One night we had a 
		comedy boxing match between Harry Crofts, weight 250, and Les Lawrence, 
		who barely tipped the scales at 95 pounds. It finished with Harry 
		playing a mouth organ as he carried Les on his shoulders around the 
		room. Kid stuff, sure! It seemed good fun then, though.<br><br>And 
		practical jokes! One of our best was on Rufus (&quot;Rough House&quot;) Chapin, 
		banker and later the long&#8209;time Treasurer of Rotary International. We 
		were dining at the Virginia Hotel that night when a woman (an excellent 
		actress we'd hired) with a squalling babe in her arms came up to &quot;Rufe,&quot; 
		said he was the baby's father, and begged money to buy milk. &quot;Rufe&quot; was 
		a bachelor and plenty embarrassed, especially when the morning paper 
		carried a story on the hoax!<br><br>Another prank was pulled on Barney 
		Arntzen, the undertaker. One night he responded to a hurry&#8209;up telephone 
		call from the Southern Hotel, where Paul Harris and Silvester Schiele 
		were living, I should add. Barney was very, very professional in manner 
		until he started to shift the corpse. It moved! As he lifted the sheet, 
		Pete Powers grinned up as the whole bunch of yelling Rotarians burst 
		into the room, I might as well admit I was on the receiving end of as 
		successful a stunt as the Club ever had. Somebody promoted a fight 
		between a badger and a bull dog, to be held in a South Side 
		roller&#8209;skating rink. There was a lot of publicity about how the 
		ferocious badger would claw the dog and I, being fond of dogs, thought 
		maybe I could save the dog from death, so consented to be referee. Only 
		my Josephine kept me from wearing a dress suit for the occasion. More 
		than 300 people were there, and at the proper moment I tugged the strap 
		to bring out the badger. Instead, I pulled out a large vessel that had 
		no proper place in public. The build&#8209;up had been so perfect I was 
		completely flabbergasted, Of course I stood treats that time!<br><br>But 
		we carried such things too far, and the prank that made us all realize 
		it was one played on Paul Harris shortly after his second term as 
		President started in 1908. One night at a dinner in the Bismarck Hotel 
		our member Congressman George P. Foster, a surety-bond man, got the 
		floor and in an eloquent spiel scored Paul for being &quot;dictatorial&quot; and 
		said he was resigning then and there from the Rotary Club. Of course a 
		few of us spoke up in Paul's defense as planned, but others had been 
		primed to follow up George Foster's remarks.<br><br>As one after another 
		sat down, Paul's face got red. No one knew how deeply he was hurt, I 
		guess, not until he arose and solemnly said no one else need resign 
		because he was resigning. Paul then. walked out of the room in a huff. 
		Of course we immediately sent a committee out to find him. The fellows 
		informed Paul that at long last we had pulled a joke on him!<br><br>
		Maybe I shouldn't even be mentioning that incident. But it seems to me 
		worth recalling<a href="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/ruggles/harris/images/tree.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="auto-style27" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/ruggles/harris/images/tree_small.jpg" style="float: right"></a> for two good reasons. One is that it shook us up, and 
		from then on, we began to grow up as a Club. We had fun, yes, but fun 
		that didn't leave a hurt. The other is that it revealed in a new way the 
		character of Paul. He held nothing against anyone. He pitched in as hard 
		as before to make meetings interesting and enjoyable, to get new 
		members, and to organize new Clubs. Nor did the experience dampen his 
		love of fun with fellowship.<br><br>Till the day he died there was a lot 
		of the boy in Paul. He could be as serious as any lawyer, then at the 
		next moment he would do the most unexpected and amusing thing. Why, I 
		remember once when Fred Tweed had an art party, all of us were to wear 
		smocks and draw from models. Paul turned an aerial somersault from the 
		straps in a streetcar. He had more new ideas in a minute than most of us 
		had in a week.<br><br>

		<img class="auto-style27" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/leaders/ruggles/harris/images/jean-paul-travelbermuda_small.jpg" style="float: left"></a>On 
		his trips around the world with Jean, his bonnie Scot lassie, he could 
		be as dignified upon occasion as anyone could expect a representative of 
		Rotary to be, but always he was ready to join in play. When Copenhagen 
		Rotarians dressed him up like a Danish maiden, flaxen wig and all, he 
		enjoyed it. In Australia, where people got their ideas about Chicago 
		from gangster movies, Rotarians staged a fake holdup &quot;just to make you 
		feel at home&quot; and he got a kick out of that.<br><br>No, there was 
		nothing of the stuffed shirt about Paul Harris. Though he had sparked 
		Rotary's growth from a handful of men at first chiefly interested in 
		swapping business with each other into a world&#8209;wide idealistic movement, 
		he insisted always that the heart of Rotary was fellowship and that 
		fellowship was to be enjoyed.<br><br>

		left us, you remember, one snowy day in January, 1947. Some 
		well-intentioned people were all for making him a sort of a saint. But 
		nothing would have been further from his sincerest desire. He had honors 
		galore, degrees from universities, and medals from Governments, yet 
		always he was the same simple person who above everything else treasured 
		and enjoyed his friends.<br><br>He didn't build grandiose castles in the 
		air about Rotary changing the world, either. Just as he was personally 
		humble, so he was restrained in his concept of what Rotary is and can 
		do.<br><br>
		&quot;If 
		Rotary has encouraged us to take a more kindly outlook on life and men,&quot; 
		he once said, &quot;if Rotary has taught us greater tolerance, and the desire 
		to see the best in others; if Rotary has brought us helpful and pleasant 
		contacts with others, who are also trying to capture and radiate the joy 
		and beauty of life, then Rotary has brought us all that we can expect.&quot;<br>
