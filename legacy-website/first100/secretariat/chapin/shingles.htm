		disease<br><br>By Rufus F. Chapin<br>Treasurer of Rotary International</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">ASSUMING by a great stretch of 
		imagination that a person afflicted with shingles can be termed a 
		patient, one of the first things the &quot;patient&quot; learns is that the origin 
		of this dread disease is as much of a mystery to the medical profession 
		as the constituency of hash in a boarding&#8209;house is to the lodger 
		consumer therof.<br><br>The learned medico at the first jump informs the 
		victim of the nature of his affliction and assures him that the disease 
		is never fatal and that the patient is sure to survive if he can manage 
		to live through it, at the same time telling him that the cause is not 
		known nor yet a cure.<br><br>Having just finished five months of 
		shingling and neuriting it seemed to me that for the general benefit of 
		mankind I should attempt to fathom the mystery of the cause of this 
		dreaded scourge. Not being able to delve into the history of hundreds of 
		cases or even scores of cases, I necessarily had to confine my research 
		to one case &#8209; my own.<br><br>If I could find out the cause of my own 
		case &#8209; that would be just one more case than the medical profession has 
		solved to date. It is generally believed that shingles arise from some 
		injury to a nerve. In looking back over my life I could not recall ever 
		injuring a nerve &#8209; in fact, I don't think I ever even offended one.<br>
		<br>I have always treated nerves with courtesy and kind consideration 
		for their feelings. I therefore abandoned the idea of nerve injury and 
		looked to other causes. I scanned my life's history for habits of diet, 
		exercise, hygiene, and regimen without turning up anything suspicious.<br>
		<br>Then one night like a flash the cause was revealed to me. I 
		remembered that the day before I was stricken, I had purchased a dozen 
		&quot;lah&#8209;de&#8209;dah&quot; shirts of hues and patterns just a trifle more moderne and 
		futuristic than bankers usually wear. I remembered looking forward to 
		appearing at the seat of big business thus arrayed and eagerly 
		contemplating the devastation that would prevail among all the blonde 
		stenographers in the shop, to say nothing of the brunettes and 
		red&#8209;heads.<br><br>Then Nature stepped in. Says Nature: Quote: &quot;Can this 
		slaughter of the innocents be permitted? No! Nature must protect its 
		own. Something must be done and done quick. This threatened disaster 
		must be diverted. Blondes are getting scarce. Mother Nature must 
		strike.&quot; Unquote.<br><br>So came the dawn. And with the dawn in lieu of 
		donning one of my recently purchased gorgeous shirts I found my manly 
		bosom bespangled with an assortment of blisters in hues ranging from 
		delicate baby&#8209;pink to deep scarlet, the sizes varying from triple A, 
		extra narrow, to 6 7/8. As each eruption was charged with 50,000 volts, 
		no shirt no matter how great its power of self&#8209;preservation could stand 
		a contact. Thus did Nature avert a calamity that boded ill for 
		femininity and thus did I discover the cause of shingles.<br><br>SINCE 
		that eventful dawn five painful months have rolled away, Did I stop at 
		finding the cause for shingles? Nay, my work was unfinished. Not merely 
		for my own sake but for the benefit of humanity I must find the cure. I 
		pondered. I repondered. Just as such an apparently unrelated cause for 
		shingles as the purchase of shirts had clicked true, so, thought I, the 
		method of cure will be found to lie in some fact that has no obvious 
		relation to the disease.<br><br>One day in examining my check&#8209;book I 
		observed that the entries therein had changed from black to red which 
		was somewhat distressing but it caused me to take stock of my savings as 
		an offset to my expenses. You see I always consider a matter from all 
		angles. Right away I realized that in five months I hadn't sent a single 
		shirt or collar to the laundry. This fact had a most startling 
		significance.<br><br>Think of the hundreds of thousands of people 
		indulging in shingles and neuritis and so unable to don shirts and 
		collars!<br><br>Think of the billions of shirts and collars that should 
		be making regular weekly visits to the laundry but ain't.<br><br>Think 
		of the tremendous loss to the laundrymen in profits!<br><br>Think of the 
		consequent loss in wages and unemployment that befalls the Unions of 
		Manglers-Wringers&#8209;Ironers&#8209;Sud Mixers&#8209;and Helpers!<br><br>The doctors who 
		should have long ago discovered the cure for shingles and neuritis have 
		loafed on the job. Let the laundrymen and laundry unions especially take 
		up the search. In fact no search is necessary. Their course of action is 
		clear and they have all the necessary equipment. Each Union has a 
		Business agent and each B. A. has his tools of the trade.<br><br>Let the 
		laundrymen send out their sleuth&#8209;hounds to find the shingle cases in 
		their trade territory. Let the B. A. seize the afflicted ones, take them 
		for a ride over to the laundry, and run 'em through the mangles, 
		wringers, and ironers. Not only will the sufferer be permanently cured 
		but he'll hail the treatment as a welcome relief. If the laundry, 
		following the usual custom of steam laundries, happens to iron off an 
		arm or a leg it will only delight the patient the more.<br><br>It is 
		with great satisfaction that I set down the results of my keen habits of 
		observing for I feel confident that when it becomes known that I have at 
		last found the cause or a cause and t he cure for shingles, my name will 
		reverberate down the corridors of time for my contribution to suffering 
		humanity.<br><br>Incidentally it is quite pat that my name &quot;Rufe&quot; should 
		lend itself so readily to reverberation. I'm quite sure that even the 
		nerviest child could learn to reverberate &quot;Rufe&quot; especially if under 
		Scotch tutelage.<br><br><em>Contributors' Column<br><br>RUFUS F. CHAPIN 
		is a banker. He was the original banker of Rotary Club number one. He 
		has, since 1912, been treasurer of Rotary International. But if he's not 
		careful he's going to be known to the world as a humorist (like Banker 
		Ellis Parker Butler). &quot;Shingles and Shirts&quot; is the latest from his fount 
		of wit, and is one result of nearly six months' confinement at his home, 
		1222 N. State street, Chicago, where he has been ill with the malady of 
		which he writes so learnedly - and feelingly.</em><br><br><strong>The 
		Rotarian, March 1931</strong><br><br>Chapin's disease eventually 
		developed into something even more serious. He was still treasurer of RI 
		when he suddenly died on June 12, 1945, while attending the 36th Annual 
		Rotary Convention in Chicago. In his obituary “My Friend Chape”, Paul 
		Harris wrote in the Rotarian, August 1945:<br><br>[…] Ten years ago 
		Chape was stricken with a painful spinal malady which continued until 
		his death. For all these years, he was practically confined to his 
		house. He employed specialists from all parts of the United States, but 
		none was able to relieve him. Often he sat unclothed except of the 
		trousers of his pajamas because he could not bear to have his clothes 
		touch his back. On the rare occasions when he went out, he wore a metal 
		harness which kept his skirt from touching his back.<br><br>Dr. Wolfgang 
		Ziegler, who provided this article, received the possible diagnose of 
		Chapin's disease from Prof. Plewig (Rotarian, RC München-Mitte).<br><br>
		Based on the information from Chapin's article and Paul Harris' 
		orbituary, Professor Plewig made the following diagnose:<br><br>&quot;The 
		disease of Rufus Chapin was possibly an especially serious form of 
		post-Zoster neuralgia. When affected with Zoster (formerly called Herpes 
		zoster, though it has nothing to do with the Herpes virus), considerable 
		complaints can manifest themselves before the outbreak of, during and 
		even after the disease. Very few patients suffer from a persisting pain, 
		which can be so marked, that even the contact with an eider feather can 
		provoke painful sensations&quot;.<br><br>Rotarian Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. 
		Gerd Plewig is the Director of the Dermatology and Allergology Clinic of 
		the Ludwig- Maximilians-University Munich. </td>
