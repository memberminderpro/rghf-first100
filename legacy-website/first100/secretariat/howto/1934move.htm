		<td valign="top" class="auto-style19">Rotary General Secretary Chesley 
		Perry, in this article from page 38 of the December 1934 issue of The 
		Rotarian, describes the series of moves of the Rotary offices. From 
		sharing a steno with the Chicago club on La Salle Street, to the new 
		(for the time) offices at 35 East Wacker Drive, Perry discusses the 
		moves, the changes in staff size and amenities, and the necessity to 
		keep providing enough space for the work of Rotary International. 
		Subsequently, the Rotary offices were moved to Evanston, Illinois, where 
		they remain today.<br><br>

		<strong>Rotary Grew and We Moved</strong><br>By Chesley R. Perry<br>Secretary of Rotary International<br>
		<br>IT WAS a hot day in Chicago in August 1910, the first Rotary 
		convention was over and the first Board of Directors was having its 
		first meeting.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="301" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/secretariat/howto/images/lawoffice1918.jpg" style="float: left" width="400">Having completed my work as presiding officer of 
		the convention I had returned to my office to attend to my own business.<br>
		<br>They called me from my office and persuaded me to take the job of 
		secretary of the organization for at least a few months. From Paul 
		Harris' office, where we had been carrying on the promotion of the 
		convention, I brought a card file and a correspondence file, and placed 
		them on the top of my desk in my own office in a building then at 189 La 
		Salle Street, near Monroe Street. The building has been replaced, and 
		the number of the street has been changed. That was the first office of 
		what is now Rotary International.<br><br>The second office was in the 
		First National Bank Building, at Dearborn and Monroe Streets. By that 
		time (January, 1911) the Chicago Rotary Club had decided to have a club 
		office. Rotary International (then Rotary National) joined with the 
		Rotary Club in sharing a small office in the bank building secured at a 
		nominal price. We also shared the services of one stenographer to begin 
		with.<br><br>We remained there until late in 1912, when we moved into 
		our own office of three small rooms in what was then the Fort Dearborn 
		Bank Building, at the corner of Clark and Monroe Streets. Its name 
		subsequently was changed. Our staff now consisted of three or four 
		people but the organization kept on growing, and in another year, larger 
		quarters were required, and there were those who felt that our small 
		back rooms were not in harmony with the dignity of such an organization 
		as Rotary international, which we began to realize was to become a 
		world-wide movement.<br><br>
		<img class="auto-style26" height="492" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/secretariat/howto/images/1933-211wacher.jpg" style="float: left" width="400">In 1914 we made our next move, which was to 
		some very fine quarters in what was then the Karpen Building, at 910 S. 
		Michigan Avenue. Later it became the Standard Oil Building. There we had 
		lovely, light offices, and so much of it that our staff, which by that 
		time had grown to about ten people, rattled around in the space. But the 
		organization still kept on growing; its administrative activities 
		increased, it began to function in several languages. Five times we had 
		to increase our space there. Separate space had to be provided for THE 
		ROTARIAN. During the nine years in the Karpen-Standard Oil Building, the 
		staff grew to a total of seventy-eight people.<br><br>The purchase of 
		the building by the Standard Oil Company and the post-war increasing 
		rental costs drove us out in 1923, when, largely from a sense of 
		economy, we moved to the Atwell Building, chiefly occupied by a printing 
		concern, at the corner of Prairie Avenue and 20th Street, in an old 
		residential section. (Twentieth Street later became Cullerton Street.) 
		Rotary International occupied about two-thirds of the entire top floor.<br>
		<br>It was good space for work by our staff, but there was some 
		dissatisfaction on the part of Rotarians both in the United States and 
		in other countries over the undignified quarters which we had there, and 
		the distance we were from the central business section of Chicago. 
		During this period we began to meet increased demands upon us by 
		developing more systematic procedure and greater efficiency rather than 
		by increasing the staff.<br><br>In 1928 we joined the trek to the new 
		Wacker Drive, along the river taking two floors in the newly 
		erectedEvening Post Building, at 211 West. The name of this building was 
		subsequently changed to The Times Building. We began here with a staff 
		of eighty-eight people (of whom thirteen were working on THE ROTARIAN). 
		<img class="auto-style26" height="250" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/secretariat/howto/images/211west_wacker.jpg" style="float: left" width="400">Here we were in an attractive location, with plenty of light; but we 
		discovered that it was a neighborhood of considerable noise. While we 
		have made every effort to keep down the number of persons on the staff, 
		we have experienced the same necessary increase of staff to keep up with 
		the growth and development of Rotary international, and, consequently, 
		the need of additional space. We now have 105 people (of whom 
		twenty-three are working on THE ROTARIAN).<br><br>This situation has now 
		been met by our moving one-half mile eastward to the building at 35 East 
		Wacker Drive, (on the extreme right) where we occupy all of the ninth 
		floor and some space on the eighth and tenth floors.<br><br>Here we have 
		made a very reasonable and economical arrangement as to rent and the 
		management of the building have been very generous in fixing up 
		<img class="auto-style26" height="257" src="https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/secretariat/howto/images/35-wacker.jpg" style="float: left" width="207">our 
		quarters in the style which they consider is befitting such an 
		organization as Rotary International. Here we have comforts and 
		conveniences that we have never before had, an attractive reception 
		room, rooms for the various officers and department heads, and for 
		conference purposes, an adequate board room, etc. Here we shall be in a 
		better position to render service to the board, the committees, the 
		district governors, the commissioners, and to club officers and 
		committees.<br><br>Located as we now are, within a block of Michigan 
		Avenue and only four blocks from State and Madison Streets, we hope that 
		many more Rotarians will pay us a visit when they are in Chicago. <br>
		<br>The new offices of the Secretariat and THE ROTARIANare on the ninth 
		floor.<br><br>Nighttime 35 Wacker Drive from a 1938 Rotarian - <br><br>
